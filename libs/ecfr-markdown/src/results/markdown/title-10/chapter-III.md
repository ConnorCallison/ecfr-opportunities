### Part 700-705

  PART 706—SECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATING TO LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

### Part 706

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 161, 68 Stat. 948, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 2201.

**Source:** Source: 41 FR 56776, Dec. 30, 1976, unless otherwise noted.

    General

      § 706.1   Purpose.

#### § § 706.1

      The purpose of this part is to set forth Department of Energy, hereinafter “DOE,” security policies and practices in the area of labor-management relations.

      § 706.2   Basis and scope.

#### § § 706.2

      The specific policies contained in this part are worked out within the framework of DOE's general objectives for labor-management relations in the DOE program, namely:

      (a) Wholehearted acceptance by contractors and by labor and its representatives of the moral responsibility inherent in participation in the DOE program;

      (b) Development of procedures to assure (1) that all participants in the program are loyal to the United States including those whose participation involves the exercise of negotiating and disciplinary authority over bargaining units, and (2) that determination of unit, jurisdiction, and similar questions will not breach security;

      (c) Continuity of production at vital DOE installations;

      (d) Consistent with DOE's responsibility under the law, the least possible governmental interference with the efficient management expected from DOE contractors;

      (e) Minimum interference with the traditional rights and privileges of American labor.

    Security Policies and Procedures in National Labor Relations Board Proceedings

      § 706.10   Policy.

#### § § 706.10

      It is policy of DOE that NLRB cases falling within the scope of the Labor Management Relations Act at the various DOE installations should be conducted in normal fashion whereever possible, on the basis of open hearings, unclassified records and published decisions. This policy does not preclude adoption of special arrangements which may be required for reasons of program security at any stage of the proceedings in particular areas.

      § 706.11   Consent elections.

#### § § 706.11

      In accordance with the recommendation of the President's Commission on Labor Relations in the Atomic Energy Installations, it is the policy of DOE to encourage every effort by management and labor at DOE installations to determine bargaining units and representatives by agreement and consent elections in preference to contested proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board.

      § 706.12   Administrative Law Judges.

#### § § 706.12

      By agreement with the National Labor Relations Board, a panel of cleared NLRB administrative law judges is maintained to facilitate resolution of questions as to the materiality of classified information in NLRB hearings and to facilitate preparation of an unclassified record. The assignment of individual administrative law judges to DOE cases remains a matter within the discretion of the National Labor Relations Board.

      § 706.13   Clearance of counsel.

#### § § 706.13

      It is recognized that clearance of counsel for the parties is sometimes desirable for proper preparation of a case even though the record is to be unclassified. Clearance of counsel makes possible their participation in any closed discussions needed preparatory to making an unclassified record. Each party is responsible for requesting clearance of its counsel well in advance so that clearance requirements will not delay the proceeding. The clearance of temporary special counsel will be terminated on completion of the proceeding.

      § 706.14   DOE's role in proceedings.

#### § § 706.14

      If controversies within the scope of the Labor Management Relations Act arise which cannot be adjusted by mutual agreement, and contested proceedings before NLRB result, each party to such proceedings will present his own position and the evidence in support thereof with due regard for existing security rules. DOE will be continuously informed of the progress of such proceedings and will act as may appear desirable (a) to assure the protection of classified information; (b) to assure that material and relevant information is not withheld from the record on grounds of security if such information can be supplied in unclassified form; and (c) to assist in determining appropriate action where a decision may turn on data which can be expressed only in classified form.

    Loyalty of Participants

      § 706.20   Policy.

#### § § 706.20

      Loyalty to the United States is a paramount factor applicable to all participants in DOE program including those whose participation (although not requiring access to restricted data) involves the exercise of administrative, negotiating and disciplinary authority over bargaining units composed of employees engaged on classified work. Individuals involved in questions of loyalty will be given full opportunity to explore the questions with DOE. DOE will take such further steps as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

    Contract Negotiation and Administration

      § 706.30   Clearance of certain local union representatives.

#### § § 706.30

      It is recognized that security clearance of certain union representatives may be necessary to assure opportunity for effective representation of employees in collective bargaining relationships with DOE contractors. Accordingly, DOE managers may authorize investigation for “Q” clearance of union officials whose functions as representatives of employees may reasonably be expected to require access to Restricted Data under NLRB and other procedures according to applicable law (LMRA, 1947); to effectively perform their representation functions in the resolution of grievances and in other collective bargaining relationships with contractors; to effectuate the recommendation of the President's Commission on Labor Relations in the Atomic Energy Installations in respect to integration of the union into the plant organization “as to two-way channel of communication and a medium of understanding between management and workers”.

      (a) In the pre-contract stage of union-management relations, the requirements of the Labor Management Relations Act normally will be the applicable criteria for determining which bargaining representatives, if any, will need access to classified material in the exercise of their functions as employee representatives.

      (b) After a bargaining relationship has been established between the contractor and the representatives of its employees the nature of this relationship and the procedures followed in it normally will be the controlling criteria for determination of the access to be granted to particular persons in carrying out their functions as employee representatives. For example, many contract grievance procedures designate by title certain union and management officials who are to have definite roles in the resolution of grievances under the procedure. Investigation for “Q” clearance will normally be in order for such officials, both company and union, employee, and non-employee. In addition, persons not so designated may be investigated for clearance where the company and the union advise DOE manager that their established relationships contemplate access for such persons.

      § 706.31   Clearance of conciliators and arbitrators.

#### § § 706.31

      Conciliators and arbitrators who are regularly assigned to DOE cases may be processed for “Q” clearance at the discretion of the local DOE manager, either on the manager's initiative or at the request of a contractor.

      § 706.32   Security indoctrination of non-employee representatives.

#### § § 706.32

      All collective bargaining representatives, company and union, who are to have access to Restricted Data, will be given appropriate security indoctrination.

      § 706.40   Final responsibility of DOE in security matters.

#### § § 706.40

      On all matters of security at all Government-owned, privately operated DOE installations, DOE retains absolute and final authority, and neither the security rules nor their administration are matters for collective bargaining between management and labor, insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible DOE will consult with representatives of management and labor in formulating security rules and regulations that affect the collective bargaining process.

      (ii) Offering such employee, consistent with the contractor's policies, an opportunity to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency. If the employee does not participate in such a rehabilitation program, the contractor must take appropriate personnel action, up to and including termination, in accordance with the contractor's policies.

      (6) Commitment to make a good faith effort to maintain a workplace free of substance abuse through implementation of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.

      (b) In addition, the following baseline elements must be included in programs developed by contractors that have identified testing designated positions (see § 707.7(b));

      (1) Notification to DOE of the positions subject to drug testing;

      (2) Prohibition of individuals in testing designated positions who are not free from the use of illegal drugs from working in those positions;

      (3) Sanctions for individuals in testing designated positions who violate the prohibitions of paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(2) of this section;

      (4) Provision for:

      (i) Notification, at least 60 days in advance of initiating testing, to those individuals subject to drug testing, unless the contractor is currently conducting a testing program.

      (ii) Urine drug analysis of applicants for testing designated positions before final selection for employment or assignment;

      (iii) Random urine drug analysis for employees in testing designated positions;

      (A) is arrested for or convicted of a drug-related offense; or

      (B) has a positive drug test result (consistent with § 707.14).

      (5) Provision to employees of the opportunity for rehabilitation, consistent with the contractor's policies, under circumstances as provided in this part (see § 707.14(b));

      (6) Immediate notification to DOE security officials whenever the circumstances in connection with procedures under this part raise a security concern as provided in DOE Orders, rules and regulations; such circumstances including, but are not necessarily limited to, a determination that an individual holding a DOE access authorization has used an illegal drug.

      (c) Each contractor's written policy and procedures under this part shall comply with the requirements of 10 CFR part 710, “Criteria and Procedures for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Matter or Significant Quantities of Special Nuclear Material.”

      (d) Contractors are required to submit all subcontracts they believe to be within the scope of this part to the Head of DOE Field Element for a determination as to whether the subcontract falls within the scope of this part. Subcontractors so determined to be within the scope of this part shall be required to agree to comply with its requirements, as a condition of eligibility for performing the subcontract work. Each subcontractor subject to this part shall submit its plan to the appropriate prime contractor for approval; the contractor shall be responsible for periodically monitoring the implementation of the subcontractor's program for effectiveness and compliance with this part.

      (e) In reviewing each proposed workplace substance abuse plan, the Head of DOE Field Element shall decide whether the program meets the applicable baseline requirements established by this part. The responsible Head of DOE Field Element will reject proposed workplace substance abuse plans that are deemed not to meet the baseline requirements. The Head of DOE Field Element shall provide the contractor with a written notification regarding the decision as to the acceptability of the plan. Nothing in this rule is intended to prohibit any contractor subject to this part from implementing workplace substance abuse requirements additional to those of the baseline, including drug testing employees and applicants for employment in any position and testing for any illegal drugs. However, the contractor shall inform Head of DOE Field Element of such additional requirements at least 30 days prior to implementation.

      (f) DOE shall periodically review and evaluate each contractor's program, including the contractor's oversight of the covered subcontractors, to assure effectiveness and compliance with this part.

      (g) Contractors or proposers will submit their program to the appropriate Head of DOE Field Element for review within 30 days of notification by the appropriate Head of DOE Field Element that the contract or proposed contract falls within the scope of this part. Workplace substance abuse programs, as provided in this part, shall be implemented within 30 days of approval by the Head of DOE Field Element. The Head of DOE Field Element may grant an extension to the notification or implementation period, as warranted by local conditions. Implementation may require changes to collective bargaining agreements as discussed in § 707.15 of this part.

      (h) To assure consistency of application, The Head of DOE Field Element shall periodically review designated contracts and testing designated positions included in the workplace substance abuse plans approved by The Head of DOE Field Element. The Head of DOE Field Element will also periodically review implementation of programs conducted by prime contractors, to assure consistency of application among prime contracts (and subcontracts where appropriate).

      (i) This part preempts any State or local law, rule, regulation, order, or standard to the extent that:

      (1) compliance with both the State or local requirement and any requirements in this part is not possible; or

      (2) compliance with the State or local requirement is an obstacle to the accomplishments and execution of any requirement in this part.

> [57 FR 32656, July 22, 1992,, as amended at 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015]

      § 707.6   Employee assistance, education, and training.

#### § § 707.6

      Contractor programs shall include the following or appropriate alternatives:

      (a) Employee assistance programs emphasizing preventive services, education, short-term counseling, coordination and referral to outside agencies, and follow-up. These services shall be available to all contractor on-site employees involved in the DOE contract. The contractor has no obligation to pay the costs of any individual's counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation beyond those services provided by the contractor's employee assistance program, except as provided for in the contractor's benefits programs. DOE undertakes no obligation to pay for any individual's counseling, rehabilitation, or treatment, unless specifically provided for by contract.

      (b) Education and training programs for on-site employees on a periodic basis, which will include, at a minimum, the following subjects:

      (1) For all on-site employees: Health aspects of substance abuse, especially illegal drug use; safety, security, and other workplace-related problems caused by substance abuse, especially illegal drug use; the provisions of this rule; the employer's policy; and available employee assistance services.

      (2) For managers and supervisors:

      (i) The subjects listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

      (ii) Recognition of deteriorating job performance or judgment, or observation of unusual conduct which may be the result of possible illegal drug use;

      (iii) Responsibility to intervene when there is deterioration in performance, or observed unusual conduct, and to offer alternative courses of action that can assist the employee in returning to satisfactory performance, judgment, or conduct, including seeking help from the employee assistance program;

      (iv) Appropriate handling and referral of employees with possible substance abuse problems, especially illegal drug use; and

      (v) Employer policies and practices for giving maximum consideration to the privacy interests of employees and applicants.

      § 707.7   Random drug testing requirements and identification of testing designated positions.

#### § § 707.7

      (a)(1) Each workplace substance abuse program will provide for random testing for evidence of the use of illegal drugs of employees in testing designated positions identified in this section.

      (2) Programs developed under this part for positions identified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section shall provide for random tests at a rate equal to 30 percent of the total number of employees in testing designated positions for each 12-month period. Employees in the positions identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and individuals identified in paragraph (c) of this section will be subject to random testing at a rate equal to 100 percent of the total number of employees or individuals, as applicable, identified, and those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) may be subject to additional drug tests.

      (b) The testing designated positions subject to random drug testing are:

      (1) Positions determined to be covered by the Human Reliability Program (HRP), codified at 10 CFR part 712. HRP employees will be subject to the drug testing standards of this part and any additional requirements of the HRP rule.

      (2) Positions identified by the contractor which entail duties where failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position could significantly harm the environment, public health or safety, or national security, such as:

      (i) Pilots;

      (ii) Firefighters;

      (iii) Protective force personnel, exclusive of those covered in paragraph (b)(1) and (c) of this section, in positions involving use of firearms where the duties also require potential contact with, or proximity to, the public at large;

      (iv) Personnel directly engaged in construction, maintenance, or operation of nuclear reactors;

      (v) Personnel directly engaged in production, use, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials sufficient to cause significant harm to the environment or public health and safety; or

      (vi) All other personnel in positions that require an access authorization (security clearance), other than those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section.

      (3) Other positions determined by the DOE, after consultation with the contractor, to have the potential to significantly affect the environment, public health and safety, or national security.

      (c) Each contractor shall require random testing of any individual, whether or not an employee, who is allowed unescorted access to the control areas of the following DOE reactors: Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). A confirmed positive test shall result in such an individual being denied unescorted access. If such an individual is not an employee of the contractor, that individual may be granted unescorted access only after the individual meets the conditions established in § 707.14(d) of this part. If, after restoration of unescorted access, such an individual is determined to have used illegal drugs for a second time, unescorted access shall be denied for a period of not less than three (3) years. Such an individual thereafter shall be granted unescorted access only upon a determination by the Head of DOE Field Element that a grant of unescorted access to the individual presents no unacceptable safety or security risk. If such an individual is an employee, that individual is subject to the other requirements of this part, including appropriate disciplinary measures.

      (d) A position otherwise subject to testing under this part may be exempted from such testing if it is within the scope of another comparable Federal drug testing program, as determined by DOE, after consultation with the contractor, to avoid unnecessary multiple tests.

> [57 FR 32656, July 22, 1992, as amended at 73 FR 3863, Jan. 23, 2008; 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015; 87 FR 49978, Aug. 15, 2022]

      § 707.8   Applicant drug testing.

#### § § 707.8

      An applicant for a testing designated position will be tested for the use of illegal drugs before final selection for employment or assignment to such a position. Provisions of this part do not prohibit contractors from conducting drug testing on applicants for employment in any position.

      § 707.9   Drug testing as a result of an occurrence.

#### § § 707.9

      When there is an occurrence which is required to be reported to DOE by the contractor, under contract provisions incorporating applicable DOE Orders, rules, and regulations, it may be necessary to test individuals in testing designated positions, or individuals with unescorted access to the control areas of the DOE reactors listed in § 707.7(c), for the use of illegal drugs, if such individuals could have caused or contributed to the conditions which caused the occurrence. For an occurrence requiring immediate notification or reporting as required by applicable DOE Orders, rules, and regulations, the contractor will require testing as soon as possible after the occurrence but within 24 hours of the occurrence, unless DOE determines that it is not feasible to do so. For other occurrences requiring notifications to DOE as required by applicable DOE Orders, rules, and regulations, the contractor may require testing.

      § 707.10   Drug testing for reasonable suspicion of illegal drug use.

#### § § 707.10

      (a)(1) It may be necessary to test any employee in a testing designated position, or individuals with unescorted access to the control areas of the DOE reactors listed in § 707.7(c), for the use of illegal drugs, if the behavior of such an individual creates the basis for reasonable suspicion of the use of illegal drugs. Two or more supervisory or management officials, at least one of whom is in the direct chain of supervision of the employee, or is a physician from the site occupational medical department, must agree that such testing is appropriate. Reasonable suspicion must be based on an articulable belief that an employee uses illegal drugs, drawn from particularized facts and reasonable inferences from those facts.

      (2) Such a belief may be based upon, among other things:

      (i) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of:

      (A) The use or possession of illegal drugs; or

      (B) The physical symptoms of being under the influence of drugs;

      (ii) A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;

      (iii) Arrest for a conviction of a drug related offense, or the identification of the individual as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession use, or trafficking;

      § 707.11   Drugs for which testing is performed.

#### § § 707.11

      Where testing is performed under this part, at a minimum, contractors will be required to test for the use of the following drugs or classes of drugs: marijuana; cocaine; opiates; phencyclidine; and amphetamines. However, when conducting reasonable suspicion or occurrence testing, the contractor may test for any drug listed in Schedules I or II of the Controlled Substances Act.

      § 707.12   Specimen collection, handling and laboratory analysis for drug testing.

#### § § 707.12

      (a) Procedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided. Contractors shall utilize a chain of custody procedure for maintaining control and accountability from point of collection to final disposition of specimens, and testing laboratories shall use appropriate cutoff levels in screening specimens to determine whether they are negative or positive for a specific drug, consistent with the HHS Mandatory Guidelines (see § 707.5(a)). The contractor shall ensure that only testing laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human Services, are utilized.

      (b)(1) If the individual refuses to cooperate with the urine collection (e.g., refusal to provide a specimen, or to complete paperwork), then the collection site person shall inform the MRO and shall document the non-cooperation on the specimen chain of custody form. The MRO shall report the failure to cooperate to the appropriate management authority, who shall report to DOE if the individual holds an access authorization. Individuals so failing to cooperate shall be treated in all respects as if they had been tested and had been determined to have used an illegal drug. The contractor may apply additional sanctions consistent with its disciplinary policy.

      (2) The collection site person shall ascertain that there is a sufficient amount of urine to conduct an initial test, a confirmatory test, and a retest, in accordance with the HHS Mandatory Guidelines. If there is not a sufficient amount of urine, additional urine will be collected in a separate container. The individual may be given reasonable amounts of liquid and a reasonable amount of time in which to provide the specimen required. The individual and the collection site person must keep the specimen in view at all times. In the event that the individual fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine, the amount collected will be noted on the “Urine Sample Custody Document.” In this case, the collection site person will telephone the individual's supervisor who will determine the next appropriate action. This may include deciding to reschedule the individual for testing, to return the individual to his or her work site and initiate disciplinary action, or both.

> [57 FR 32656, July 22, 1992, as amended at 73 FR 3863, Jan. 23, 2008; 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015]

      § 707.13   Medical review of results of tests for illegal drug use.

#### § § 707.13

      (a) All test results shall be submitted for medical review by the MRO. A confirmed positive test for drugs shall consist of an initial test performed by the immunoassay method, with positive results on that initial test confirmed by another test, performed by the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method (GC/MS). This procedure is described in the HHS Mandatory Guidelines.

      (b) The Medical Review Officer will consider the medical history of the employee or applicant, as well as any other relevant biomedical information. When there is a confirmed positive test result, the employee or applicant will be given an opportunity to report to the MRO the use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication. If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result, consistent with legal and non-abusive drug use, the MRO will certify that the test results do not meet the conditions for a determination of use of illegal drugs. If no such certification can be made, the MRO will make a determination of use of illegal drugs. Determinations of use of illegal drugs will be made in accordance with the criteria provided in the Medical Review Officer Manual issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.

> [57 FR 32656, July 22, 1992, as amended at 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015]

      § 707.14   Action pursuant to a determination of illegal drug use.

#### § § 707.14

      (a) When an applicant for employment has been tested and determined to have used an illegal drug, processing for employment will be terminated and the applicant will be so notified.

      (b)(1) When an employee who is in a testing designated position has been tested and determined to have used an illegal drug, the contractor shall immediately remove that employee from the testing designated position; if such employee also holds, or is an applicant for, an access authorization, then the contractor shall immediately notify DOE security officials for appropriate adjudication. If this is the first determination of use of illegal drugs by that employee (for example, the employee has not previously signed a DOE drug certification, and has not previously tested positive for use of illegal drugs), the employee may be offered a reasonable opportunity for rehabilitation, consistent with the contractor's policies. If rehabilitation is offered, the employee will be placed in a non-testing designated position, which does not require a security clearance, provided there is such an acceptable position in which the individual can be placed during rehabilitation; if there is no acceptable non-testing designated position, the employee will be placed on sick, annual, or other leave status, for a reasonable period sufficient to permit rehabilitation. However, the employee will not be protected from disciplinary action which may result from violations of work rules other than a positive test result for illegal drugs.

      (2) Following a determination by the site occupational medical department, after counseling or rehabilitation, that the employee can safely return to duty, the contractor may offer the employee reinstatement, in the same or a comparable position to the one held prior to the removal, consistent with the contractor's policies and the requirements of 10 CFR part 710. Failure to take the opportunity for rehabilitation, if it has been made available, for the use of illegal drugs, will require significant disciplinary action up to and including removal from employment under the DOE contract, in accordance with the contractor's policies. Any employee who is twice determined to have used illegal drugs shall in all cases be removed from employment under the DOE contract. Also, if an employee who has signed a DOE drug certification violates the terms of the certification, DOE shall conduct a timely review of the circumstances of such violation, and the individual's continued eligibility for a DOE access authorization shall be determined under the provisions of 10 CFR part 710, “Criteria and Procedures for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Matter or Significant Quantities of Special Nuclear Material.”

      (c) An employee who has been removed from a testing designated position because of the use of illegal drugs may not be returned to such position until that employee has:

      (1) Successfully completed counseling or a program of rehabilitation;

      (2) Undergone a urine drug test with a negative result; and

      (3) Been evaluated by the site occupational medical department, which has determined that the individual is capable of safely returning to duty.

      (d) An individual who is not an employee of a contractor who has been denied unescorted access because of the use of illegal drugs may not have the unescorted access reinstated until that individual has:

      (1) Provided evidence of successful completion of counseling or a program of rehabilitation;

      (2) Undergone a urine drug test with a negative result; and

      (3) Been evaluated by the site occupational medical department, which has determined that the individual is capable of being permitted unescorted access to a reactor control area.

      (e) If a DOE access authorization is involved, DOE must be notified of a contractor's intent to return to a testing designated position an employee removed from such duty for use of illegal drugs. Positions identified in § 707.7(b)(1) of this part will require DOE approval prior to return to a testing designated position.

      (f) An individual who has been notified of a positive test result may request a retest of the same sample at the same or another certified laboratory. The individual shall bear the costs of transportation and/or testing of the specimen. The contractor will inform employees of their right to request a retest under the provisions of this paragraph.

      (g) After an employee determined to have used illegal drugs has been returned to duty, the employee shall be subject to unannounced drug testing, at intervals, for a period of 12 months.

> [57 FR 32656, July 22, 1992,, as amended at 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015; 87 FR 49979, Aug. 15, 2022]

      § 707.15   Collective bargaining.

#### § § 707.15

      When establishing drug testing programs, contractors who are parties to collective bargaining agreements will negotiate with employee representatives, as appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such negotiation, however, cannot change or alter the requirements of this rule because DOE security requirements themselves are non-negotiable under the security provisions of DOE contracts. Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be subject to the provisions of this rule until those agreements have been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the contractor will unilaterally implement the requirements of this rule.

      § 707.16   Records.

#### § § 707.16

      (a) Confirmed positive test results shall be provided to the Medical Review Officer and other contractor and DOE officials with a need to know. Any other disclosure may be made only with the written consent of the individual.

      (b) Contractors shall maintain maximum confidentiality of records related to illegal drug use, to the extent required by applicable statutes and regulations (including, but not limited to, 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3, 42 U.S.C. 290ee-3, and 42 CFR part 2). If such records are sought from the contractor for criminal investigations, or to resolve a question or concern relating to the Personnel Assurance Program certification or access authorization under 10 CFR part 710, any applicable procedures in statute or regulation for disclosure of such information shall be followed. Moreover, owing to DOE's express environmental, public health and safety, and national security interests, and the need to exercise proper contractor oversight, DOE must be kept fully apprised of all aspects of the contractor's program, including such information as incidents involving reasonable suspicion, occurrences, and confirmed test results, as well as information concerning test results in the aggregate.

      (c) Unless otherwise approved by DOE, the contractors shall ensure that all laboratory records relating to positive drug test results, including initial test records and chromatographic tracings, shall be retained by the laboratory in such a manner as to allow retrieval of all information pertaining to the individual urine specimens for a minimum period of five years after completion of testing of any given specimen, or longer if so instructed by DOE or by the contractor. In addition, a frozen sample of all positive urine specimens shall be retained by the laboratory for at least six months, or longer if so instructed by DOE.

      (d) The contractor shall maintain as part of its medical records copies of specimen chain of custody forms.

      (e) The specimen chain of custody form will contain the following information:

      (1) Date of collection;

      (2) Tested person's name;

      (3) Tested employee/applicant's social security number or other identification number unique to the individual;

      (4) Specimen number;

      (5) Type of test (random, applicant, occurrence, reasonable suspicion, follow-up, or other);

      (6) Temperature range of specimen;

      (7) Remarks regarding unusual behavior or conditions;

      (8) Collector's signature; and

      (9) Certification signature of specimen provider certifying that specimen identified is in fact the specimen the individual provided.

      § 707.17   Permissible actions in the event of contractor noncompliance.

#### § § 707.17

      Actions available to DOE in the event of contractor noncompliance with the provisions of this part or otherwise performing in a manner inconsistent with its approved program include, but are not limited to, suspension or debarment, contract termination, or reduction in fee in accordance with the contract terms.

      § 708.18   Dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or other good cause.

#### § § 708.18

      (a) The Head of Field Element or EC Director (as applicable) may dismiss a complaint for lack of jurisdiction or for other good cause after receiving the complaint, either on his own initiative or at the request of a party named in the complaint.

      § 708.22   Investigation of complaints.

#### § § 708.22

      (a) The OHA Director will appoint a person to conduct an investigation. The investigator may not participate or advise in any proceedings in the case subsequent to the investigation's completion.

      (b) The investigator will determine the appropriate scope of investigation based on the circumstances of the complaint. The investigator may enter and inspect places and records; make copies of records; interview persons alleged to have been involved in retaliation and other individuals who may have relevant information; take sworn statements; and require the production of any documents or other evidence.

      (c) All parties must cooperate fully with the investigator by making all pertinent evidence available. The contractor must make employees available upon request.

      (d) A person being interviewed in an investigation has the right to be represented by a person of his choosing.

      (e) Parties to the complaint are not entitled to be present at interviews conducted by an investigator.

      (f) If a person other than the complainant requests that his identity be kept confidential, the investigator may grant confidentiality, but must advise such person that confidentiality means that the Office of Hearings and Appeals will not identify the person as a source of information to anyone outside the Office of Hearings and Appeals, except as required by statute or other law, or as determined by the OHA Director to be unavoidable.

      (g) At any point during the investigation, the investigator may request that the OHA Director appoint an Administrative Judge to whom the complaint will be referred for a decision on whether dismissal is appropriate. The investigator will serve the parties with notice of the referral. The investigator will submit a written statement to the Administrative Judge outlining the reasons he believes dismissal may be appropriate and any facts supporting that belief. The Administrative Judge will then decide whether to dismiss the complaint. In making such decision, the Administrative Judge will have access to the entire investigative file. The Administrative Judge's decision, regardless of outcome, will be served on all the parties. A complaint may be dismissed prior to the completion of the investigation for:

      (1) Any reason listed in § 708.18(c), or

      (2) Lack of merit, provided the facts obtained by the investigator indicate there is no genuine dispute of material fact.

      (h) If the Administrative Judge decides to dismiss the complaint, he will issue an initial agency decision that includes the factual and legal bases for the dismissal. The investigator's written statement will be attached to the Administrative Judge's initial agency decision and served on all the parties. No report of investigation will issue for a complaint dismissed by the Administrative Judge following a referral for dismissal by the investigator.

      (i) If the Administrative Judge decides not to dismiss the complaint, he will issue a written statement to that effect which will include the factual and legal basis for his decision. The investigation will then continue. The OHA Director may, at his discretion, appoint a new investigator.

      (j) Dismissals under paragraph (h) of this section may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 708.32, 708.33, 708.34, and 708.35. Decisions not to dismiss under paragraph (i) of this section may not be appealed.

      § 708.23   Time to issue a report of investigation.

      (a) If the complaint is not dismissed prior to the completion of the investigation, the investigator will complete the investigation and issue a report of investigation by the 60th day after the complaint is received by the Office of Hearings and Appeals, unless the OHA Director, for good cause, extends the investigation for no more than 30 days. If a case is referred for dismissal by an investigator, the time to issue the report of investigation stops running on the day of referral and, if the Administrative Judge decides against dismissal, begins to run again on the day after the Administrative Judge's decision issues.

      (b) The investigator will provide copies of the report of investigation to the parties. The investigation will not be reopened after the report of investigation is issued.

      § 708.24   Hearings not required.

#### § § 708.24

      (a) A complainant may withdraw a hearing request after the report of investigation is issued. However, the hearing may be canceled only if all parties agree that they do not want a hearing.

Hearings may be conducted by video teleconference or other remote means, at the Administrative Judge's discretion.

      § 708.27   The Administrative Judge may not require that the parties participate in alternative dispute resolution.

#### § § 708.27

      The Administrative Judge may recommend, but may not require, that the parties attempt to resolve the complaint through alternative dispute resolution.

    Subpart B—Eligibility for Access to Classified Matter or Special Nuclear Material

      § 710.6   Cooperation by the individual.

#### § § 710.6

      (a)(1) It is the responsibility of the individual to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to DOE's relevant and material questions, and when requested, to furnish or authorize others to furnish information that the DOE deems pertinent to the individual's eligibility for access authorization. This obligation to cooperate applies when completing security forms, during the course of a personnel security background investigation, reinvestigation or continuous vetting, and at any stage of DOE's processing of the individual's access authorization request, including but not limited to, personnel security consultations, DOE-sponsored mental health evaluations, and other authorized DOE actions under this part. The individual may elect not to cooperate; however, such refusal may prevent DOE from reaching an affirmative finding required for granting or continuing the access authorization. In this event, for incumbents any access authorization then in effect may be administratively withdrawn or, for applicants, further processing may be administratively terminated.

      (2) It is the responsibility of an individual subject to 10 CFR 709.3(d) to consent to and take a polygraph examination required by part 709. A refusal to consent to or take such an examination may prevent DOE from reaching an affirmative finding required for continuing access authorization. In this event, any access authorization then in effect may be administratively withdrawn.

      (b) If the individual believes that the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section have been inappropriately applied, the individual may file a written appeal of the action with the Director within 30 calendar days of the date the individual was notified of the action.

      (c) Upon receipt of the written appeal, the Director shall conduct an inquiry as to the circumstances involved in the action and shall, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written appeal, notify the individual, in writing, of their decision. If the Director determines that the action was inappropriate, the Director shall notify the Manager that access authorization must be reinstated or, for applicants, that the individual must continue to be processed for access authorization. If the Director determines the action was appropriate, the Director shall notify the individual of this fact in writing. The Director's decision is final and not subject to further review or appeal.

      § 710.7   Application of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines.

#### § § 710.7

      (a) The decision on an access authorization request is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after consideration of all relevant information, favorable and unfavorable, as to whether the granting or continuation of access authorization will not endanger the common defense and security and is clearly consistent with the national interest. Any doubt as to an individual's access authorization eligibility shall be resolved in favor of the national security.

      (b) All such determinations shall be based upon the application of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Adjudicative Guidelines), or any successor national standard issued under authority of the President.

      (c) Each Adjudicative Guideline sets forth a series of concerns that may create a doubt regarding an individual's eligibility for access authorization. In resolving these concerns, all DOE officials involved in the decision-making process shall consider: The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age and maturity of the individual at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the absence or presence of rehabilitation or reformation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; the likelihood of continuation or recurrence; and other relevant and material factors.

      (d) If the investigative results report of an individual or other reliable information tend to establish the validity and significance of one or more areas of concern as set forth in the Adjudicative Guidelines, such information shall be regarded as derogatory and create a question as to the individual's access authorization eligibility. Absent any derogatory information, a favorable determination will be made as to access authorization eligibility.

> [81 FR 71335, Oct. 17, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 57107, Dec. 4, 2017; 89 FR 59596, July 23, 2024]

      § 710.8   Action on derogatory information.

#### § § 710.8

      (a) If a question arises as to the individual's access authorization eligibility, the Local Director of Security shall authorize the conduct of a consultation with the individual, or other appropriate actions and, on the basis of the results of such consultation or actions, may authorize the granting of the individual's access authorization. If, in the opinion of the Local Director of Security, the question as to the individual's access authorization eligibility has not been favorably resolved, the Local Director of Security shall submit the matter to the Manager with a recommendation that authority be obtained to process the individual's case under administrative review procedures set forth in this part.

      (b) If the Manager agrees that unresolved derogatory information is present and that appropriate attempts to resolve such derogatory information have been unsuccessful, the Manager shall notify the Director of the proposal to conduct an administrative review proceeding, accompanied by an explanation of the security concerns and a duplicate Personnel Security File. If the Manager believes that the derogatory information has been favorably resolved, the Manager shall direct that access authorization be granted for the individual. The Manager may also direct the Local Director of Security to obtain additional information prior to deciding whether to grant the individual access authorization or to submit a request for authority to conduct an administrative review proceeding. A decision in the matter shall be rendered by the Manager within 10 calendar days of its receipt.

      (c) Upon receipt of the Manager's notification, the Director shall review the matter and confer with the Manager on:

      (1) The institution of administrative review proceedings set forth in §§ 710.20 through 710.30;

      (2) The granting of access authorization; or

      (3) Other actions as the Director deems appropriate.

      (d) The Director shall act pursuant to one of these options within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Manager's notification unless an extension is granted by the Deputy Director for Security, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security.

> [81 FR 71335, Oct. 17, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 41292, June 26, 2023; 89 FR 59596, July 23, 2024]

      § 710.9   Suspension of access authorization.

#### § § 710.9

      (a) If derogatory information is received, the Local Director of Security shall authorize action(s), to be taken on an expedited basis, to resolve the question pursuant to § 710.8(a). If the question as to the individual's continued access authorization eligibility is not resolved in favor of the individual, the Local Director of Security shall submit the matter to the Manager with the recommendation that the individual's access authorization be suspended pending the final determination resulting from the procedures set forth in this part.

      (b) If the information received is determined to represent an immediate threat to national security or to the safety or security of a DOE facility or employee, or is determined to be so serious in nature that action(s) to resolve the matter as set forth in § 710.8(b) are not practical or advisable, the Local Director of Security shall immediately submit the matter to the Manager with a recommendation that the individual's access authorization be suspended pending the final determination resulting from the procedures set forth in this part. The Manager shall either authorize the immediate suspension of access authorization, or shall direct the Local Director of Security to take action(s) as set forth in § 710.8(b), in an expedited manner, to resolve the matter.

      (c) The Manager shall, within two working days of receipt of the recommendation from the Local Director of Security to suspend the individual's DOE access authorization:

      (1) Approve the suspension of access authorization; or

      (2) Direct the continuation of access authorization, or

      (3) Take or direct other such action(s) as the Manager deems appropriate.

      (d) Upon suspension of an individual's access authorization pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the individual, the individual's employer, any other DOE office or program having an access authorization interest in the individual, and, if known, any other government agency where the individual holds an access authorization, security clearance, or access approval, or to which the DOE has certified the individual's DOE access authorization, shall be notified immediately in writing. The appropriate DOE database for tracking access authorizations and related actions shall also be updated. Notification to the individual shall reflect, in general terms, the reason(s) why the suspension has been affected. Pending final determination of the individual's eligibility for access authorization from the operation of the procedures set forth in this part, the individual shall not be afforded access to classified matter, special nuclear material, or unescorted access to security areas that require the individual to possess a DOE access authorization.

      (e) Written notification to the individual shall include notification that if the individual believes that the action to suspend their access authorization was taken as retaliation against the individual for having made a protected disclosure, as defined in Presidential Policy Directive 19,  or any successor directive issued under the authority of the President, the individual may submit a request for review of this matter directly to the DOE Office of the Inspector General. Such a request shall have no impact upon the continued processing of the individual's access authorization eligibility under this part. If the individual receives an adverse final agency determination in response to such request, the individual may submit an appeal of that decision to the Director of National Intelligence, in accordance with the Security Executive Agent Directive 9, Appellate Review of Retaliation Regarding Security Clearances and Access Determinations, or to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive 120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection.

      (f) Following the decision to suspend an individual's DOE access authorization pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Manager shall immediately notify the Director in writing of the action and the reason(s) therefor. In addition, the Manager, within 10 calendar days of the date of suspension (unless an extension of time is approved by the Director), shall notify the Director in writing of their proposal to conduct an administrative review proceeding, accompanied by an explanation of its basis and a duplicate Personnel Security File.

      (g) Upon receipt of the Manager's notification, the Director shall review the matter and confer with the Manager on:

      (1) The institution of administrative review procedures set forth in §§ 710.20 through 710.30; or

      (2) The reinstatement of access authorization; or

      (3) Other actions as the Director deems appropriate.

      (h) The Director shall act pursuant to one of these options within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Manager's notification unless an extension is granted by the Deputy Director for Security, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security.

> [81 FR 71335, Oct. 17, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 41292, June 26, 2023; 89 FR 59596, July 23, 2024]

    Subpart C—Administrative Review

      § 710.20   Purpose of administrative review.

#### § § 710.20

      These procedures govern the conduct of the administrative review of questions concerning an individual's eligibility for access authorization when it is determined that such questions cannot be favorably resolved by consultation or other action.

> [81 FR 71335, Oct. 17, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 59596, July 23, 2024]

      § 710.21   Notice to the individual.

#### § § 710.21

      (a) Unless an extension is authorized in writing by the Director, within 30 calendar days of receipt of authority to institute administrative review procedures, the Manager shall prepare and deliver to the individual a notification letter approved by the local Office of Chief Counsel, or the Office of the General Counsel for Headquarters cases. Where practicable, the letter shall be delivered to the individual in person.

      (b) The letter shall state:

      (1) That reliable information in the possession of DOE has created a substantial doubt concerning the individual's eligibility for access authorization.

      (2) The information which creates a substantial doubt regarding the individual's access authorization eligibility (which shall be as comprehensive and detailed as the national security permits) and why that information creates such doubt.

      (3) That the individual has the option to have the substantial doubt regarding eligibility for access authorization resolved in one of two ways:

      (i) By the Manager, without a hearing, on the basis of the existing information in the case; or

      (ii) By personal appearance before an Administrative Judge (a “hearing”).

      (4) That, if the individual desires a hearing, the individual must, within 20 calendar days of the date of receipt of the notification letter, make a written request for a hearing to the Manager from whom the letter was received.

      (5) That the individual may also file with the Manager the individual's written answer to the reported information which raises the question of the individual's eligibility for access authorization, and that, if the individual requests a hearing without filing a written answer, the request shall be deemed a general denial of all of the reported information.

      (6) That, if the individual so requests, a hearing shall be scheduled before an Administrative Judge, with due regard for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives, for the purpose of affording the individual an opportunity of supporting his eligibility for access authorization. The Administrative Judge shall decide whether the hearing will be conducted via video teleconferencing.

      (7) That, if a hearing is requested, the individual will have the right to appear personally before an Administrative Judge or, at the discretion of the Administrative Judge, via video teleconferencing; to present evidence in their own behalf, through witnesses, or by documents, or both; and, subject to the limitations set forth in § 710.26(g), to be present during the entire hearing and be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel or other representative of the individual's choosing and at the individual's own expense at every stage of the proceedings. Such representative or counsel, if applicable, shall be identified in writing to the Administrative Judge and DOE Counsel and authorized by the individual to receive all correspondence, transcripts and other documents pertaining to the proceedings under this part.

      (8) That the individual's failure to file a timely written request for a hearing before an Administrative Judge in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, unless time deadlines are extended for good cause, shall be considered as a relinquishment by the individual of the right to a hearing provided in this part, and that in such event a final decision to deny or revoke the individual's access authorization shall be made by the Manager.

      (9) That in any proceedings under this subpart DOE Counsel will participate on behalf of and representing DOE and that any statements made by the individual to DOE Counsel may be used in subsequent proceedings;

      (10) The individual's access authorization status until further notice;

      (11) The name and telephone number of the designated DOE official to contact for any further information desired concerning the proceedings, including an explanation of the individual's rights under the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act;

      (12) If applicable, that if the individual is currently the subject of criminal charges for a felony offense or an offense punishable by imprisonment of one year or more, the individual must elect either to continue with the Administrative Review process and have the substantial doubt regarding eligibility for access authorization resolved by the Manager or by a hearing, or to withdraw from the Administrative Review process.

      (i) If the individual elects to continue with the Administrative Review process a determination as to the individual's access authorization shall be made by the Manager or by an Administrative Judge via a hearing. The individual will be expected to participate fully in the process. Any refusal to cooperate, answer all questions, or provide requested information may prevent DOE from reaching an affirmative finding required for granting or continuing access authorization.

      (ii) If the individual elects to withdraw from the Administrative Review process, the individual's access authorization shall be administratively withdrawn. Such action shall be taken in accordance with applicable procedures set forth in pertinent Departmental directives. Any future requests for access authorization for the individual must be accompanied by documentary evidence of resolution of the criminal charges.

      (iii) The individual must, within 20 calendar days of receipt of the notification letter, indicate in writing their decision to continue or to withdraw from the Administrative Review process. Such notification must be made to the Manager from whom the notification letter was received.

      (c) The notification letter referenced in paragraph (b) of this section shall also:

      (1) Include a copy of this part and SEAD 4,  or successor directive; and

      (2) Indicate that if the individual believes that the action to process the individual under this part was taken as retaliation against the individual for having made a protected disclosure, as defined in Presidential Policy Directive 19,  or any successor directive issued under the authority of the President, the individual may submit a request for review of this matter directly to the DOE Office of the Inspector General. Such a request shall have no impact upon the continued processing of the individual's access authorization eligibility under this part. If the individual receives an adverse final agency determination in response to such request, the individual may submit an appeal of that decision to the Director of National Intelligence, in accordance with the SEAD 9,  or to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, in accordance with  Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection.

The Manager shall either grant or deny, or reinstate or revoke, the individual's access authorization.

      (c) A letter reflecting the Manager's initial decision shall be signed by the Manager and delivered to the individual within 15 calendar days of the date of the Manager's decision unless an extension of time is granted by the Director.

      (1) Of the Manager's unfavorable decision and the reason(s) therefor;

      (2) That within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the letter, the individual may file a written request for a review of the Manager's initial decision, through the Director, to the DOE Headquarters Appeal Panel (Appeal Panel);

      (3) That the Director may, for good cause shown, at the written request of the individual, extend the time for filing a written request for a review of the case by the Appeal Panel; and

      (4) That if the written request for a review of the Manager's initial decision by the Appeal Panel is not filed within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the Manager's letter, or by the date to which the Director has granted an extension, the Manager's initial decision in the case shall be final and not subject to further review or appeal.

      § 710.24   Appointment of DOE Counsel.

#### § § 710.24

      (a) Upon receipt from the individual of a written request for a hearing, a DOE attorney shall forthwith be assigned by the Manager to act as DOE Counsel.

      (b) DOE Counsel is authorized to consult directly with the individual if he/she is not represented by counsel, or with the individual's counsel or other representative if so represented, to clarify issues and reach stipulations with respect to testimony and contents of documents and physical evidence.

Requests for subpoenas shall be liberally granted except where the Administrative Judge finds that the issuance of subpoenas would result in evidence or testimony that is repetitious, incompetent, irrelevant, or immaterial to the issues in the case. The Administrative Judge may take sworn testimony, sequester witnesses, and control the dissemination or reproduction of any record or testimony taken pursuant to this part, including correspondence, or other relevant records or physical evidence including, but not limited to, information retained in computerized or other automated systems in possession of the subpoenaed person.

      (e) The Administrative Judge shall determine the day, time, and place for the hearing and shall decide whether the hearing will be conducted via video teleconferencing.

      § 710.26   Conduct of hearings.

#### § § 710.26

      (a) In all hearings conducted under this part, the individual shall have the right to be represented by a person of their own choosing, at the individual's own expense. The individual is responsible for producing witnesses in their own behalf, including requesting the issuance of subpoenas, if necessary, or presenting testimonial, documentary, or physical evidence before the Administrative Judge to support the individual's defense to the derogatory information contained in the notification letter. With the exception of procedural or scheduling matters, the Administrative Judge is prohibited from initiating or otherwise engaging in  discussions about the case during the pendency of proceedings under this part.

      (b) Unless the Administrative Judge finds good cause for deferring issuance of a decision, in the event that the individual unduly delays the hearing, such as by failure to meet deadlines set by the Administrative Judge, the record shall be closed, and an initial decision shall be made by the Manager on the basis of the record in the case per § 710.22(a)(3).

      (c) Hearings shall be open only to DOE Counsel, duly authorized representatives of DOE, the individual and the individual's counsel or other representatives, and such other persons as may be authorized by the Administrative Judge. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Judge, witnesses shall testify in the presence of the individual but not in the presence of other witnesses.

      (d) DOE Counsel shall assist the Administrative Judge in establishing a complete administrative hearing record in the proceeding and bringing out a full and true disclosure of all facts, both favorable and unfavorable, having a bearing on the issues before the Administrative Judge. The individual shall be afforded the opportunity of presenting testimonial, documentary, and physical evidence, including testimony by the individual in the individual's own behalf. All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination, if possible.

      (e) The Administrative Judge may ask the witnesses any questions which the Administrative Judge deems appropriate to assure the fullest possible disclosure of relevant and material facts.

      (f) During the course of the hearing, the Administrative Judge shall rule on all objections raised.

      (g) In the event it appears during the course of the hearing that classified matter may be disclosed, it shall be the duty of the Administrative Judge to assure that disclosure is not made to persons who are not authorized to receive it, and take other appropriate measures.

      (h) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but the Federal Rules of Evidence may be used as a guide for procedures and principles designed to assure production of the most probative evidence available. The Administrative Judge shall admit into evidence any matters, either oral or written, which are material, relevant, and competent in determining issues involved, including the testimony of responsible persons concerning the integrity of the individual. In making such determinations, the utmost latitude shall be permitted with respect to relevancy, materiality, and competency. The Administrative Judge may also exclude evidence which is incompetent, immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious. Every reasonable effort shall be made to obtain the best evidence available. Subject to §§ 710.26(l), 710.26(m), 710.26(n) and 710.26(o), hearsay evidence may, at the discretion of the Administrative Judge and for good cause show, be admitted without strict adherence to technical rules of admissibility and shall be accorded such weight as the Administrative Judge deems appropriate.

      (i) Testimony of the individual and witnesses shall be given under oath or affirmation. Attention of the individual and each witness shall be directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 18 U.S.C. 1621.

      (j) The Administrative Judge shall endeavor to obtain all the facts that are reasonably available in order to arrive at a decision. If, prior to or during the proceedings, in the opinion of the Administrative Judge, the derogatory information in the notification letter is not sufficient to address all matters into which inquiry should be directed, the Administrative Judge may recommend to the Manager concerned that, in order to give more adequate notice to the individual, the notification letter should be amended. Any amendment shall be made with the concurrence of the local Office of Chief Counsel or the Office of the General Counsel in Headquarters cases. If, in the opinion of the Administrative Judge, the circumstances of such amendment may involve undue hardship to the individual because of limited time to respond to the new derogatory information in the notification letter, an appropriate adjournment shall be granted upon the request of the individual.

      (k) A written or oral statement of a person relating to the characterization in the notification letter of any organization or person other than the individual may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge without affording the individual an opportunity to cross-examine the person making the statement on matters relating to the characterization of such organization or person, provided the individual is given notice that such a statement has been received and may be considered by the Administrative Judge, and is informed of the contents of the statement, provided such notice is not prohibited by paragraph (g) of this section.

      (l) Any oral or written statement adverse to the individual relating to a controverted issue may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge without affording an opportunity for cross-examination in either of the following circumstances:

      (1) The head of the agency supplying the statement certifies that the person who furnished the information is a confidential informant who has been engaged in obtaining intelligence information for the Government and that disclosure of the informant's identity would be substantially harmful to the national interest;

      (2) The Secretary or the Secretary's special designee for that particular purpose has preliminarily determined, after considering information furnished by the investigative agency as to the reliability of the person and the accuracy of the statement concerned, that:

      (i) The statement concerned appears to be reliable and material; and

      (ii) Failure of the Administrative Judge to receive and consider such statement would, in view of the access sought to classified matter or special nuclear material, be substantially harmful to the national security and that the person who furnished the information cannot appear to testify:

      (A) Due to death, severe illness, or similar cause, in which case the identity of the person and the information to be considered shall be made available to the individual, or

      (B) Due to some other specified cause determined by the Secretary to be good and sufficient.

      (m) Whenever procedures under paragraph (l) of this section are used:

      (1) The individual shall be given a summary or description of the information which shall be as comprehensive and detailed as the national interest permits, and

      (2) Appropriate consideration shall be accorded to the fact that the individual did not have an opportunity to cross-examine such person(s).

      (n) Records compiled in the regular course of business, or other evidence other than investigative reports obtained by DOE, may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge subject to rebuttal without authenticating witnesses, provided that such information has been furnished to DOE by an investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary to safeguard classified matter or special nuclear material.

      (o) Records compiled in the regular course of business, or other evidence other than investigative reports, relating to a controverted issue which, because they are classified, may not be inspected by the individual, may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge, provided that:

      (1) The Secretary or the Secretary's special designee for that particular purpose has made a preliminary determination that such evidence appears to be material;

      (2) The Secretary or the Secretary's special designee for that particular purpose has made a determination that failure to receive and consider such evidence would, in view of the access sought to classified matter or special nuclear material, be substantially harmful to the national security; and

      (3) To the extent that national security permits, a summary or description of such evidence is made available to the individual. In every such case, information as to the authenticity and accuracy of such evidence furnished by the investigative agency shall be considered.

      (p) The Administrative Judge may request the Local Director of Security to arrange for additional investigation on any points which are material to the deliberations of the Administrative Judge and which the Administrative Judge believes need further investigation or clarification. In this event, the Administrative Judge shall set forth in writing those issues upon which more evidence is requested, identifying where possible persons or sources from which the evidence should be sought. The Local Director of Security shall make every effort through appropriate sources to obtain additional information upon the matters indicated by the Administrative Judge.

      § 710.27   Administrative Judge's decision.

#### § § 710.27

      (a) The Administrative Judge shall carefully consider the entire record of the proceeding and shall render a decision, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the hearing transcript, as to whether granting or restoring the individual's access authorization would not endanger the common defense and security and would be clearly consistent with the national interest. In resolving a question concerning the eligibility of an individual for access authorization under these procedures, the Administrative Judge shall consider the factors stated in § 710.7(c) to determine whether the findings will be favorable or unfavorable.

      (b) In reaching the findings, the Administrative Judge shall consider the demeanor of the witnesses who have testified at the hearing, the probability or likelihood of the truth of their testimony, their credibility, and the authenticity and accuracy of documentary evidence, or lack of evidence on any material points in issue. If the individual is, or may be, prejudiced by the non-disclosure to the individual of undisclosed information or by lack of opportunity to cross-examine confidential informants, the Administrative Judge shall take that fact into consideration. The possible adverse impact of the loss of the individual's access authorization upon the DOE program in which the individual works shall not be considered by the Administrative Judge.

      (c) The Administrative Judge shall make specific findings based upon the record as to the validity of each instance of derogatory information contained in the notification letter and the significance which the Administrative Judge attaches to it. These findings shall be supported fully by a statement of reasons which constitute the basis for such findings.

      (d) The Administrative Judge's decision shall be based on the Administrative Judge's findings of fact. If, after considering all of the factors set forth in § 710.7(c) in light of the Adjudicative Guidelines, the Administrative Judge is of the opinion that it will not endanger the common defense and security and will be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate access authorization for the individual, the Administrative Judge shall render a favorable decision; otherwise, the Administrative Judge shall render an unfavorable decision. Within 15 calendar days of the Administrative Judge's written decision, the Administrative Judge shall provide copies of the decision and the administrative record to the Manager and the Director.

      § 710.30   Action by the Secretary.

#### § § 710.30

      (a) Whenever an individual has not been afforded an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses who have furnished information adverse to the individual under the provisions of §§ 710.26(l) or (o), the Secretary may issue a final decision to deny or revoke access authorization for the individual after personally reviewing the administrative record and any additional material provided by the Chair. The Secretary's authority may, in accordance with applicable provisions of Executive Order 12968, be delegated to the Deputy Secretary where the effected individual is a Federal employee. The Secretary's authority, in accordance with applicable provisions of Executive Order 10865, may not be delegated where the effected individual is a contractor employee. This authority may be exercised only when the Secretary determines that the circumstances described in § 710.26(l) or (o) are present, and such determination shall be final and not subject to review or appeal.

      (b) Whenever the Secretary issues a final decision as to an individual's access authorization eligibility, the individual and other concerned parties shall be notified in writing by the Chair of that decision and of the Secretary's findings with respect to each instance of derogatory information contained in the notification letter and each substantial issue identified in the statement in support of the request for review to the extent allowed by the national security.

      (c) Nothing contained in these procedures shall be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and powers of the Secretary to issue subpoenas or to deny or revoke access to classified matter or special nuclear material.

      § 710.31   Reconsideration of access eligibility.

#### § § 710.31

      (a) If, pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§ 710.20 through 710.30, the Manager, Administrative Judge, Appeal Panel, or the Secretary has made a decision granting or reinstating an individual's access authorization, eligibility shall be reconsidered as a new administrative review under the procedures set forth in this part when previously unconsidered derogatory information is identified, or the individual violates a commitment upon which the DOE previously relied to favorably resolve an issue of access authorization eligibility.

      (b) If, pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§ 710.20 through 710.31, the Manager, Administrative Judge, Appeal Panel, or the Secretary has made a decision denying or revoking the individual's access authorization, eligibility may be reconsidered only when the individual so requests in writing, when there is a bona fide offer of employment requiring access authorization, and when there is either material and relevant new evidence which the individual and the individual's representatives were without fault in failing to present earlier, or convincing evidence of rehabilitation or reformation.

      (1) A request for reconsideration shall be accepted when a minimum of one year has elapsed since the date of the Manager's, Administrative Judge's, Appeal Panel's or Secretary's final decision, or of a previous denial of reconsideration. Requests must be submitted in writing to the Deputy Director for Security, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, and must include an affidavit setting forth in detail the new evidence or evidence of rehabilitation or reformation.

      (2) If the Deputy Director for Security, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security approves the request for reconsideration of an individual's access authorization eligibility, he/she shall so notify the individual, and shall direct the Manager to take appropriate actions to determine whether the individual is eligible for access authorization.

      (3) If the Deputy Director for Security, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security denies the request for reconsideration of an individual's access authorization eligibility, he/she shall so notify the individual in writing.

      (5) If, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Manager determines the individual remains ineligible for access authorization, the Manager shall so notify the Director in writing. If the Director concurs, the Director shall notify the individual in writing. This decision is final and not subject to review or appeal. If the Director does not concur, the Director shall confer with the Manager on further actions.

      (6) Determinations as to eligibility for access authorization pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section may be based solely upon the mitigation of derogatory information which was relied upon in a final decision to deny or to revoke access authorization. If, pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, previously unconsidered derogatory information is identified, a determination as to eligibility for access authorization must be subject to a new Administrative Review proceeding.

#### § § 710.32

      (a) If the individual is no longer an applicant for access authorization or no longer requires access authorization, the procedures of this part shall be terminated without a final decision as to the individual's access authorization eligibility, unless a final decision has been rendered prior to the DOE being notified of the change in the individual's pending access authorization status. Where the procedures of this part have been terminated pursuant to this paragraph after an unfavorable initial agency decision as to the individual's access authorization eligibility has been rendered, any subsequent request for access authorization for the individual will be processed as a request for a review of the initial agency decision by the Appeal Panel and a final agency decision will be rendered pursuant to § 710.29, unless a minimum of one year has elapsed since the date of the initial agency decision.

      (b) With regard to applicants (individuals for whom DOE has not yet approved access authorization), DOE may administratively terminate processing an application for access authorization under the following circumstances:

      (1) If the applicant is currently the subject of criminal proceedings for a felony offense or an offense that is punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or longer, or is awaiting or serving a form of probation, suspended or deferred sentencing, or parole. Once all judicial proceedings on the criminal charges have been finally resolved, and the term (if any) of imprisonment, probation, or parole has been completed, DOE processing of a request for access authorization shall resume upon receipt by DOE of a written request therefor, provided that the individual has a bona fide offer of employment requiring access authorization.

      (2) If sufficient information about the individual's background cannot be obtained to meet the investigative scope and extent requirements for the access authorization requested.

      (c) If an individual believes that the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section have been inappropriately applied, a written appeal may be filed with the Director within 30 calendar days of the date the individual was notified of the action. The Director shall act on the written appeal as described in § 710.6(c).

      § 710.33   Time frames.

#### § § 710.33

      Statements of time established for processing aspects of a case under this part are the agency's desired time frames in implementing the procedures set forth in this part. However, failure to meet the time frames shall have no impact upon the final disposition of an access authorization by a Manager, Administrative Judge, the Appeal Panel, or the Secretary, and shall confer no procedural or substantive rights upon an individual whose access authorization eligibility is being considered.

      § 710.34   Acting officials.

#### § § 710.34

      Except for the Secretary, the responsibilities and authorities conferred in this part may be exercised by persons who have been designated in writing as acting for, or in the temporary capacity of, the following DOE positions: The Local Director of Security; the Manager; the Director, or the General Counsel.

All such nominations must be submitted to and approved by either the NNSA Administrator, his or her designee, the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security or the appropriate Lead Program Secretarial Officer, or his or her designee.

        (c) Before nominating a position for designation as an HRP position, the Manager or the HRP management official must analyze the risks the position poses for the particular operational program. If the analysis shows that more restrictive physical, administrative, or other controls could be implemented that would prevent the position from being designated an HRP position, those controls will be implemented, if practicable.

        (d) Nothing in this part prohibits contractors from establishing stricter employment standards for individuals who are nominated to DOE for certification or recertification in the HRP.

        (1) Require the individual to stop performing HRP duties;

        (2) Take action to ensure the individual is denied both escorted and unescorted access to the material access areas; and

        (3) Notify, within 24 hours, the HRP management official of the immediate removal. The HRP management official shall take actions consistent with § 712.19.

        § 712.14   Medical assessment.

#### § § 712.14

        (a)  The HRP medical assessment is performed to evaluate whether an HRP candidate or an HRP-certified individual:

        (1) Represents a security concern; or

        (2) Has a condition that may prevent the individual from performing HRP duties in a reliable and safe manner.

        (b)  (1) The medical assessment is performed initially on HRP candidates and individuals occupying HRP positions who have not yet received HRP certification. The medical assessment is performed annually for HRP-certified individuals, or more often as required by the SOMD.

        (2) The Designated Physician and other examiners working under the direction of the Designated Physician also will conduct an evaluation:

        (i) If an HRP-certified individual requests an evaluation ( self-referral); or

        (ii) If an HRP-certified individual is referred by management for an evaluation.

        (c)  The Designated Physician, under the supervision of the SOMD, is responsible for the medical assessment of HRP candidates and HRP-certified individuals. In performing this responsibility, the Designated Physician or the SOMD must integrate the medical evaluations, available testing results, psychological evaluations, any psychiatric evaluations, a review of current legal drug use, and any other relevant information. This information is used to determine if a reliability, safety, or security concern exists and if the individual is medically qualified for his or her assigned duties.

        (d)  The Designated Physician, with the assistance of the Designated Psychologist, must determine the existence or nature of any of the following:

        (1) Physical or medical disabilities, such as a lack of visual acuity, defective color vision, impaired hearing, musculoskeletal deformities, and neuromuscular impairment;

        (2) Mental/personality disorders or behavioral problems, including alcohol and other substance use disorders, as described in the

        (3) Use of illegal drugs or the abuse of legal drugs or other substances, as identified by self-reporting or by medical or psychological evaluation or testing;

        (4) Threat of suicide, homicide, or physical harm; or

        (5) Medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, endocrine disease, cerebrovascular or other neurologic disease, or the use of drugs for the treatment of conditions that may adversely affect the judgment or ability of an individual to perform assigned duties in a reliable and safe manner.

        (e)  Before the initial or annual medical assessment and psychological evaluation, employers must provide, to both the Designated Physician and Designated Psychologist, a job task analysis for each HRP candidate or HRP-certified individual. Medical assessments and psychological evaluations may not be performed if a job task analysis has not been provided.

        (f)  Psychological evaluations must be conducted:

        (1) For initial HRP certification. This psychological evaluation consists of a psychological assessment (test), approved by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security or his or her designee, and a semi-structured interview.

        (2) For recertification: This psychological evaluation consists of a semi-structured interview. A psychological assessment (test) may also be conducted as warranted.

        (3) Every third year: The medical assessment for recertification must include a psychological assessment (test) approved by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security or his or her designee. This requirement can be implemented over a 3-year period for individuals who are currently in an HRP position.

        (4) When additional psychological or psychiatric evaluations are required by the SOMD to resolve any concerns.

        (g)  HRP-certified individuals who have been on sick leave for five or more consecutive days, or an equivalent time period for those individuals on an alternative work schedule, must report in person to the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD before being allowed to return to normal duties. The Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD must provide a written recommendation to the appropriate HRP supervisor regarding the individual's return to work. An HRP-certified individual also may be required to report to the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD for written recommendation to return to normal duties after any period of sick leave.

        (h)  The Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD may recommend temporary removal of an individual from an HRP position or restrictions on an individual's work in an HRP position if a medical condition or circumstance develops that affects the individual's ability to perform assigned job duties. The Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD must immediately recommend medical removal or medical restrictions in writing to the appropriate HRP management official. If the HRP management official concurs, he or she will then notify the appropriate HRP certifying official. To reinstate or remove such restrictions, the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD must make written recommendation to the HRP management official. The HRP management official will then notify the appropriate HRP certifying official.

        (i)  (1) Individuals who request reinstatement in the HRP following rehabilitative treatment for alcohol use disorder, use of illegal drugs, or the abuse of legal drugs or other substances, must undergo an evaluation, as prescribed by the SOMD, to ensure continued rehabilitation and adequate capability to perform their job duties.

        (2) The HRP certifying official may reinstate HRP certification of an individual who successfully completes an SOMD-approved drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. Recertification is based on the SOMD's follow-up evaluation and recommendation. The individual is also subject to unannounced follow-up tests for illegal drugs or alcohol and relevant counseling for 3 years.

        (j)  HRP-certified individuals are required to immediately report to the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD any physical or mental condition requiring medication or treatment. The Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD determines if temporary removal of the individual from HRP duties is recommended and follows the procedures pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.

        § 712.15   Management evaluation.

#### § § 712.15

        (a)  An evaluation by the HRP management official is required before an individual can be considered for initial certification or recertification in the HRP. This evaluation must be based on a careful review of the results of the supervisory review, medical assessment, and drug and alcohol testing. If a safety or security concern is identified with respect to an HRP-certified individual, the HRP management official must take actions consistent with § 712.19(a).

        (b)  All HRP candidates and HRP-certified individuals are subject to testing for the use of illegal drugs, as required by this part. Testing must be conducted in accordance with 10 CFR part 707, the workplace substance abuse program for DOE contractor employees, and DOE Order 343.1, “Federal Substantive Abuse Testing Program,” for DOE employees. The program must include an initial drug test, random drug tests at least once every 12 months from the previous test, and tests of HRP-certified individuals if they are involved in an incident, unsafe practice, occurrence, or based on reasonable suspicion. Failure to appear for unannounced testing within 2 hours of notification constitutes a refusal to submit to a test. Sites may establish a shorter time period between notification and testing but may not exceed the two-hour requirement. If an HRP-certified individual refuses to submit to a drug test or, based on a drug test, is determined to use illegal drugs, the supervisor must immediately remove the individual from HRP duties and take actions consistent with § 712.13(f).

        (c)  All HRP candidates and HRP-certified individuals are subject to testing for the use of alcohol, as required by this part. The alcohol testing program must include, as a minimum, an initial alcohol test prior to performing HRP duties and random alcohol tests at least once every 12 months from the previous test, and tests of HRP-certified individuals if they are involved in an incident, unsafe practice, occurrence, or based on reasonable suspicion. The supervisor who has been informed that an HRP-certified individual's confirmatory breath alcohol test result is at or above an alcohol concentration of 0.02 percent shall send that individual home and not allow that individual to perform HRP duties for 24 hours, and take all appropriate administrative action consistent with § 712.13(f).

        (1) Breath alcohol testing must be conducted by a certified breath alcohol technician and conform to the DOT procedures (49 CFR part 40, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs, subparts J through N) for use of an evidential-grade breath analysis device approved for 0.02/0.04 cutoff levels, which conforms to the DOT model specifications and the most recent “Conforming Products List” issued by NHTSA.

        (2) An individual required to undergo DOT alcohol testing is subject to the regulations of the DOT. If such an individual's blood alcohol level exceeds DOT standards, the individual's employer may take appropriate disciplinary action.

        (3) The following constitutes a refusal to submit to a test and shall be considered as a positive alcohol concentration test of 0.02 percent, which requires the individual be sent home and not allowed to perform HRP duties for 24 hours:

        (i) Failure to appear for unannounced testing within 2 hours of notification (or established shorter time for the specific site);

        (ii) Failure to provide an adequate volume of breath in 2 attempts without a valid medical excuse; and

        (iii) Engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process, including failure to cooperate with reasonable instructions provided by the testing technician.

        (d)  (1) When an HRP-certified individual is involved in, or associated with, an occurrence requiring immediate reporting to the DOE, the following procedures must be implemented:

        (i) Testing for the use of illegal drugs in accordance with the provisions of the DOE policies implementing Executive Order 12564, and 10 CFR part 707 or DOE Order 3792.3, which establish workplace substance abuse programs for contractor and DOE employees, respectively.

        (ii) Testing for use of alcohol in accordance with this section.

        (2) Testing must be performed as soon as possible after an occurrence that requires immediate notification or reporting.

        (3) The supervisor must immediately remove an HRP-certified individual from HRP duties if the individual refuses to undergo the testing required by this subsection.

        (e)  (1) If the behavior of an individual in an HRP position creates the basis for reasonable suspicion of the use of an illegal drug or alcohol, that individual must be tested if two or more supervisory or management officials, at least one of whom is in the direct chain of supervision of the individual or is the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD, agree that such testing is appropriate.

        (2) Reasonable suspicion must be based on an articulable belief, drawn from facts and reasonable inferences from those particular facts that an HRP-certified individual is in possession of, or under the influence of, an illegal drug or alcohol. Such a belief may be based on, among other things:

        (i) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of the use or possession of illegal drugs or alcohol, or the physical symptoms of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol;

        (ii) A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;

        (iii) Information provided by a reliable and credible source that is independently corroborated; or

        (iv) Detection of alcohol odor on the breath.

        (f)  HRP candidates and, when selected, HRP-certified individuals, must submit to and successfully complete a counterintelligence evaluation, which may include a polygraph examination in accordance with 10 CFR part 709, Polygraph Examination Regulations and any subsequent revisions to that regulation.

        § 712.16   Security review.

#### § § 712.16

        (a) A personnel security specialist must review the personnel security file of every HRP candidate and every HRP-certified individual up for certification or recertification.

        (b) If the personnel security file review is favorable, this information must be forwarded to the HRP certifying official and so noted on the certification form. If the review reveals a security concern, or if a security concern is identified during another component of the HRP process, the HRP certifying official must be notified, and the personnel security specialist must evaluate the concern in accordance with 10 CFR part 710. If a final determination is made by DOE personnel security to suspend access authorization, the HRP management official must be notified, the individual shall be temporarily removed from the HRP position, the HRP certifying official notified, and the information noted on the certification form.

        (c) A favorable adjudication of security concerns under 10 CFR part 710 does not require granting or continuing HRP certification. Security concerns can be reviewed and evaluated for purposes of granting or continuing HRP certification even if the concerns have been favorably resolved under part 710.

        (d) Any mental/personality disorder or behavioral issues found in a personnel security file, which could impact an HRP candidate or HRP-certified individual's ability to perform HRP duties, may be provided in writing to the SOMD, Designated Physician, and Designated Psychologist previously identified for receipt of this information. Medical personnel may not share any information obtained from the personnel security file with anyone who is not an HRP certifying official, except as consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974.

        (e) If the DOE personnel security review is not completed within the 12-month time period for recertification and the individual's access authorization is not suspended, the HRP certification form shall be forwarded to the HRP certifying official for recertification or temporary removal, pending completion of the personnel security review.

        § 712.17   Instructional requirements.

#### § § 712.17

        (a) HRP management officials at each DOE site or facility with HRP positions must establish an initial and annual HRP instruction and education program. The program must provide:

        (1) HRP candidates, HRP-certified individuals, supervisors, and managers, and supervisors and managers responsible for HRP positions with the knowledge described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

        (2) For all HRP medical personnel, a detailed explanation of HRP duties and responsibilities.

        (b) The following program elements must be included in initial and annual instruction. The elements may be tailored to accommodate group differences and refresher training needs:

        (1) The objectives of the HRP and the role and responsibilities of each individual in the HRP to include recognizing and responding to behavioral change and aberrant or unusual behavior that may result in a risk to national security or nuclear explosive safety; recognizing and reporting safety and/or security concerns, physical, mental, or emotional conditions that could adversely affect the performance of HRP duties or that require treatment by a doctor, physician's assistant or other health care professional; and prescription drug use; and an explanation of return-to-work requirements and continuous evaluation of HRP participants; and

        (2) For those who have nuclear explosive responsibilities, a detailed explanation of duties and safety requirements.

        § 712.18   Transferring HRP certification.

#### § § 712.18

        (a) For HRP certification to be transferred, the individual must currently be certified in the HRP.

        (b) Transferring the HRP certification from one site to another requires the following before the individual is allowed to perform HRP duties at the new site:

        (1) Verify that the individual is currently certified in the HRP and is transferring into a designated HRP position;

        (2) Incorporate the individual into the new site's alcohol and drug-testing program;

        (3) Ensure that the 12-month time period for HRP requirements that was established at the prior site is not exceeded; and

        (4) Provide site-specific instruction.

        (c) Temporary assignment to HRP positions at other sites requires verification that the individual is currently enrolled in the HRP and has completed all site-specific instruction. The individual is required to return to the site that maintains his or her HRP certification for recertification.

        § 712.19   Actions related to removal, revocation and/or reinstatement.

#### § § 712.19

        (a)  The HRP management official shall direct the temporary removal of an HRP-certified individual when the management official:

        (1) Identifies, during the course of the management evaluation, a safety or security concern that warrants such removal based on one or more of the types of behaviors and conditions identified in § 712.13(c);

        (2) Receives a supervisor's written notice of the immediate removal of an HRP-certified individual; or

        (3) Receives a recommendation from the Designated Physician, the Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD to medically remove an HRP-certified individual consistent with § 712.14(h).

        (b) The temporary removal of an HRP-certified individual from HRP duties pending a determination of the individual's reliability is an interim, precautionary action and does not constitute a determination that the individual is not fit to perform his or her required duties. Removal is not, in itself, cause for loss of pay, benefits, or other changes in employment status. Immediately upon directing a temporary removal, the HRP management official must notify the supervisor to take appropriate actions consistent with an immediate removal. Within five (5) business days of placing the individual on a temporary removal, the HRP management official must notify the individual in writing that s/he is temporarily removed.

        (c) If temporary removal is based on derogatory information that is a security concern, the HRP management official must notify the HRP certifying official and the applicable DOE personnel security office.

        (d) If temporary removal is based on a medical concern, the HRP management official must obtain a recommendation from the Designated Physician, Designated Psychologist, or the SOMD consistent with § 712.14(h).

        (e) If the HRP management official determines, after conducting an evaluation of the circumstances or information that led to the temporary removal, that an individual who has been temporarily removed continues to meet the requirements for certification, the HRP management official must:

        (1) Direct that the supervisor reinstate the individual and provide written explanation of the reasons and factual bases for the action;

        (2) Notify the individual; and

        (3) Notify the HRP certifying official.

        (f) If the HRP management official determines that an individual who has been temporarily removed does not meet the HRP requirements for certification, the HRP management official must prepare a case chronology that explains why the individual does not meet the requirement for certification and forward it to the HRP certifying official. The HRP management official's determination that an individual does not meet certification requirement must be based on one or more of the types of behaviors and conditions identified in § 712.13(c). The HRP certifying official must review the case chronology from the HRP management official and take one of the following actions:

        (1) Direct that the supervisor reinstate the individual, with any applicable medical restrictions, provide written explanation of the reasons and factual bases for the action, and notify the individual;

        (2) Direct continuation of the temporary removal pending completion of specified actions (e.g., medical assessment, treatment) to resolve the concerns about the individual's reliability; or

        (3) Recommend to the Manager the revocation of the individual's certification and provide the case chronology to the Manager. If the HRP certifying official is the Manager, he or she should take actions consistent with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (g) The Manager, on receiving the HRP management official's case chronology and the HRP certifying official's recommendation (if any), must take one of the following actions:

        (1) Direct that the supervisor reinstate the individual, provide written explanation of the reasons and factual bases for the action, and notify the individual;

**Source:** Source: 56 FR 55064, Oct. 24, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

    § 715.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 715.1

    This part sets forth the definition of “nonrecourse project-financed” as that term is used to define “new independent power production facility,” in section 416(a)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 7651o(a)(2)(B). This definition is for purposes of section 416(a)(2)(B) only. It is not intended to alter or impact the tax treatment of any facility or facility owner under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.

    § 715.2   Definitions.

#### § § 715.2

    As used in this subpart—

    means the Clean Air _Act_ Amendments of 1990, 104 Stat. 2399.

    means a “new independent power production facility” as that term is used in the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7651o(a)(2).

    § 715.3   Definition of “Nonrecourse Project-Financed”.

#### § § 715.3

    means when being financed by any debt, such debt is secured by the assets financed and the revenues received by the facility being financed including, but not limited to, part or all of the revenues received under one or more agreements for the sale of the electric output from the facility, and which neither an electric utility with a retail service territory, nor a public utility as defined by section 201(e) of the Federal Power Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 824(e), if any of its facilities are financed with general credit, is obligated to repay in whole or in part. A commitment to contribute equity or the contribution of equity to a facility by an electric utility shall not be considered an obligation of such utility to repay the debt of a facility. The existence of limited guarantees, commitments to pay for cost overruns, indemnity provisions, or other similar undertakings or assurances by the facility's owners or other project participants will not disqualify a facility from being “nonrecourse project-financed” as long as, at the time of the financing for the facility, the borrower is obligated to make repayment of the term debt from the revenues generated by the facility, rather than from other sources of funds. Projects that are 100 percent equity financed are also considered “nonrecourse project-financed” for purposes of section 416(a)(2)(B).

      (3) Non-management and operating contracts exceeding $100,000,000 that include cost reimbursable elements exceeding $10,000,000 (e.g., contracts with both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable line items where the cost-reimbursable line items exceed $10,000,000 or time and materials contracts where the materials portions exceed $10,000,000).

      (b) This part also covers contracts otherwise not covered by paragraph (a) of this section but which contain a clause requiring compliance with this part.

      (c) This part also covers any contract the Department awards directly to retained legal counsel exceeding $100,000.

      § 719.4   Are law firms that are retained by contract by the Department covered by this part?

#### § § 719.4

      Legal counsel retained under fixed rate or other type of contract or other agreement by the Department to provide legal services must comply with the following if the legal costs over the life of the matter for which counsel has been retained are expected by the Department to exceed $100,000 and retained legal counsel are so notified by the Department:

      (a) Requirements related to Staffing and Resource Plans in subpart B of this part;

      (b) Cost guidelines in subpart E of this part; and

      (c) Engagement letter requirements in subpart C of this part if the retained legal counsel subcontracts legal work valued at $25,000 or more (e.g., a law firm retained by the Department subcontracts with another law firm to provide $26,000 in discovery-related legal work).

      § 719.5   What contracts are not covered by this part?

#### § § 719.5

      This part does not cover any contract under which the Department is not responsible for directly reimbursing the contractor for legal costs, such as fixed price contracts.

      § 719.6   Are there any types of legal matters not included in the coverage of this part?

#### § § 719.6

      Legal matters not covered by this part include:

      (a) Matters handled by counsel retained by an insurance carrier, except under retrospective insurance in accordance with § 719.45;

      (b) Routine intellectual property law support services; and

      (c) Routine workers and unemployment compensation matters.

      § 719.7   Is there a procedure for exceptions or deviations from this part?

#### § § 719.7

      (a) Requests for exceptions or deviations from this part must be made in writing to Department Counsel and approved by the General Counsel. If an alternate procedure is proposed for compliance with an individual requirement in this part, that procedure must be included in the written request by the contractor. The General Counsel or his/her delegee shall provide a written response to such requests; however the response shall not require a justification of the Department's exercise of its discretion.

      (b) The General Counsel may authorize exceptions or deviations requested under paragraph (a) of this section. The General Counsel may also establish exceptions to this part based on current field office and contractor practices that satisfy the purpose of these requirements.

In any event, the written request from a contractor for a deviation from a cost principle relating to this part must be submitted to the contracting officer, with a copy provided to Department Counsel.

      § 719.8   Does the provision of protected documents from the contractor to the Department constitute a waiver of privilege?

#### § § 719.8

      Contractors are required to provide detailed information about third-party claims and litigation to the Department. The Department and its contractors typically share common legal and strategic interests relating to pending or threatened litigation. The common interest between the parties is primarily rooted in the fact that the Department reimburses contractors for allowable costs incurred when litigation is threatened or initiated against contractors. However, other sources of the common interest between the Department and its contractors may include, but are not limited to, an interest in completion of the agency's important mission work and an interest in safe and efficient operation of the Department's facilities. To the extent documents associated with compliance with this part (e.g., Staffing and Resource Plans, invoices, engagement letters, settlement authority requests, and draft pleadings) are protected from disclosure to third parties because the items constitute attorney work product and/or involve attorney client communications, the contractor's provision of these items to the Department does not constitute a waiver of privilege. As long as the Department and the contractor share a common interest in the outcome of legal matters, this mutual legal interest permits the parties to share privileged material without waiving any applicable privilege.

    Subpart E—Reimbursement of Costs Subject to This Part

      § 719.40   What effect do the regulations of this part have on cost allowability?

#### § § 719.40

      Contractor and retained legal counsel compliance with this part is a prerequisite for allowability of legal costs. However, compliance with this part does not guarantee that legal costs will be determined to be allowable. Only the contracting officer has the authority to determine allowability of costs in accordance with 48 CFR (FAR) part 31 and (DEAR) part 931 and all other applicable contract terms and conditions.

      § 719.41   How does the Department determine whether fees are reasonable?

#### § § 719.41

      In determining whether fees or rates charged by retained legal counsel are reasonable, the Department may consider among other things:

      (a) Whether the lowest reasonably achievable fees or rates (including any currently available or negotiable discounts) were obtained from retained legal counsel;

      (b) Whether lower rates from other firms providing comparable services, at appropriate competency and experience levels, were available;

      (c) Whether alternative rate structures such as flat, contingent, and other innovative proposals, were considered; and

      (d) The complexity of the legal matter and the expertise of the law firm in this area.

      § 719.42   What categories of costs are unallowable?

#### § § 719.42

      (a) Specific categories of unallowable costs are contained in the cost principles at 48 CFR (FAR) part 31 and 48 CFR (DEAR) part 931 and 48 CFR 970.31. See also 41 U.S.C. 4304.

      (b) Costs that are customarily or already included in billed hourly rates are not separately reimbursable.

      (c) Interest charges that a contractor incurs on any outstanding (unpaid) bills from retained legal counsel are not reimbursable.

      § 719.43   What is the treatment of travel costs?

#### § § 719.43

      (a) Travel and related expenses must at a minimum comply with the restrictions set forth in 48 CFR 31.205-46, or 48 CFR (DEAR) 970.3102-05-46, as appropriate, to be reimbursable.

      (b) Travel time may be allowed at a full hourly rate for the portion of time during which retained legal counsel performs legal work for which it was retained; any remaining travel time shall be reimbursed at 50 percent of the full hourly rate, except that in no event will travel time spent working for other clients be allowable. Also, for long distance travel that could be completed by various methods of transportation, e.g., car, train, or plane, costs charged by retained legal counsel or any agent of retained legal counsel will be considered reasonable only if the individuals charge no more travel time than it would take to utilize the fastest mode of transportation that is cost-effective. For example, if retained legal counsel travels for 10 hours by train when a cost-effective flight that would take two hours to get to the same destination is available, the attorney may charge a maximum of two hours for the time spent traveling.

      § 719.44   What categories of costs require advance approval?

#### § § 719.44

      (a) To be considered for reimbursement, costs incurred by retained legal counsel for the following require advance written approval from Department Counsel or the submission of subsequent specific justification to Department Counsel when circumstances out of the contractor's control make advance approval unobtainable:

      (1) Computers or general application software, or non-routine computerized databases, if they are specifically created for a particular matter. For costs associated with the creation and use of computerized databases, contractors and retained legal counsel must ensure that the creation and use of computerized databases is necessary and cost-effective. Use of databases originally created by the Department or its contractors for other purposes, but that can be used to assist a contractor or retained legal counsel in connection with a particular matter, should be considered. Contractors and retained legal counsel must ensure that DOE is provided the discretion to obtain unlimited access to and dominion over any computers or general application software, or non-routine computerized databases specifically created for a particular matter;

      (2) Secretarial and support services, word processing, or temporary support personnel;

      (3) Attendance by more than one attorney at a deposition, court hearing or interview;

      (4) Expert witnesses and consultants;

      (5) Trade publications, books, treatises, background materials, and other similar documents;

      (6) Professional or educational seminars and conferences;

      (7) Preparation of bills or time spent responding to questions about bills from either the Department or the contractor;

      (8) Food and beverages when the attorney or consultant is not on travel status and away from the home office;

      (9) Pro hac vice admissions; and

      (10) Time charged for law students' or interns' services.

      (b) Requests for fee increases by retained legal counsel, other than those under contract directly with the Department, must be sent in writing to the contractor, who will review the request for reasonableness. If the contractor determines the request is reasonable, the contractor must seek approval for the increase from Department Counsel before it authorizes any increase. Contractors should attempt to lock in rates for partners, associates and paralegals for at least a two year period.

      § 719.45   Are there any special procedures or requirements regarding subcontractor and retrospective insurance carrier legal costs?

#### § § 719.45

      (a) The contractor shall establish a monitoring system for significant matters in litigation which are handled by subcontractors other than retrospective insurance carriers whose contracts provide for the reimbursement of legal costs. The purpose of this monitoring system is to enable the contractor to be regularly informed of the progress of the Significant Matter, to monitor the associated costs and help ensure that they are reasonable, and to report on the progress of the Significant Matter and the associated costs to Department Counsel.

      (b) The contractor shall require retrospective insurance carriers and other subcontractors whose contracts provide for the reimbursement of legal costs to request prior permission from the contractor to enter into a settlement agreement with, or make any payments to, claimants or third-parties if:

      (1) In the case of a subcontractor other than a retrospective insurance carrier, the settlement or payment amount is likely to reach $25,000 or more; or

      (2) In the case of a retrospective insurance carrier, the settlement or payment amount is likely to reach $100,000 or more.

      (c) The contractor shall require the insurance carrier or other subcontractor to submit all documentation described in § 719.34 and to provide the contractor with a copy of the executed settlement agreement within seven days of execution, which the contractor will promptly forward to Department Counsel. The contractor shall not authorize the subcontractor to enter into a settlement agreement or make a payment to a claimant or third-party that is likely to reach or exceed the above-stated threshold amounts without first obtaining the approval of the Department Counsel.

#### § § 725.23

      (a) Neither the United States, nor DOE, nor any person acting on behalf of DOE makes any warranty or other representation, expressed or implied, (1) with respect to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information made available pursuant to an access permit, or (2) that the use of any such information may not infringe privately owned rights.

      (b) The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, on behalf of DOE, hereby waives such rights with respect to any invention or discovery as it may have pursuant to section 152 of the Act by reason of such invention or discovery having been made or conceived in the course of, in connection with, or resulting from access to Restricted Data received under the terms of an access permit. (Note provisions of § 725.23(d).)

      (c) Each permittee shall:

      (1) Comply with all applicable provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and with parts 810 and 1016 of this title and with all other applicable rules, regulations, and orders of DOE, including such rules, regulations, and orders as DOE may adopt or issue to effectuate the policies specified in the act directing DOE to strengthen free competition in private enterprise and avoid the creation or maintenance of a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws.

      (4) Obtain and preserve in his files written agreements from all individuals who will have access to Restricted Data under his access permit. The agreement shall be as follows:

      (5) Pay all established charges for personnel access authorizations, DOE consulting services, publication and reproduction of documents, and such other services as DOE may furnish in connection with the access permit.

      (d) The following terms and conditions are applicable to an access permit authorizing access to restricted data in category C-24, isotope separation irrespective of whether access to DOE's restricted data information is desired:

      (1) The permittee agrees to grant a nonexclusive license at reasonable royalties to the United States and, at the request of DOE, to domestic and foreign persons, to use in the production or enrichment of special nuclear material any U.S. patent or any U.S. patent application (otherwise in condition for allowance except for a secrecy order thereon) on any invention or discovery made or conceived by the permittee, its employees, or others engaged by the permittee in the course of the permittee's work under the access permit, or as a result of access to data or information made available by DOE.

      (2) The permittee agrees to grant to the United States, and, at the request of DOE, to domestic and foreign persons, the right at reasonable royalties to use for research, development, or manufacturing programs for the production or enrichment of special nuclear material, any technical information or data, including economic evaluations thereof, of a proprietary nature developed by the permittee, its employees, or others engaged by the permittee in the course of the permittee's work under the access permit or as a result of access to data or information made available by DOE and not covered by a U.S. patent or U.S. patent application referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If DOE disseminates any such proprietary technical information or data in its possession to any of its contractors for use in any DOE research, development, production, or manufacturing programs, it will do so under contractual provisions pursuant to which the contractor would undertake to use this information only for the work under the pertinent DOE contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, the permittee waives any claim against DOE for compensation or otherwise, in connection with any use or dissemination of information or data not specifically identified and claimed by the permittee as proprietary in a written notice to DOE at the time of the furnishing of the information or data to DOE. As used in this subparagraph, the term “technical information or data, including economic evaluations thereof, of a proprietary nature” means information or data which:

      (i) Is not the property of the Government by virtue of any agreement;

      (ii) Concerns the details of trade secrets or manufacturing processes which the permittee has protected from us by others; and

      (iii)(A) Is specifically identified as proprietary at the time it is made available to DOE.

      (B) Technical information or data shall not be deemed proprietary in nature whenever substantially the same technical information is available to DOE which has been prepared, developed or furnished as nonproprietary information by another source independently of the proprietary information and data furnished by the permittee.

      (3) If the amount of reasonable royalties provided for in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section cannot be agreed upon, the permittee agrees that such amount shall be determined by the Administrator under the provisions of section 157c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

      (4) In the event domestic commercial uranium enriching services are provided by persons other than an agency of the United States, the permittee agrees not to require the United States to pay the royalties provided for in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.

      (5) The acceptance, exercise, or use of the licenses or rights provided for in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section shall not prevent the Government, at any time, from contesting their validity, scope or enforceability.

      (6) The permittee agrees, during the term of the access permit, to make quarterly reports to DOE in writing, in reasonable detail, respecting all technical information or data, including economic evaluations thereof, which the permittee or DOE considers may be of interest to DOE, including reports of patent applications on inventions or discoveries and of technical information and data of a proprietary nature. These reports will cover the results of the permittee's work under the access permit or as a result of data or information made available by DOE. The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.

      (7) The permittee agrees to make available to DOE, at all reasonable times during the term of the access permit, for inspection by DOE personnel, or by mutual agreement, others on behalf of DOE, all experimental equipment and technical information or data developed by the permittee, its employees, or others engaged by the permittee, in the course of the permittee's work under the access permit or as a result of data or information made available by DOE. The foregoing provision of this subparagraph shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.

      (8) The permittee agrees to pay such reasonable compensation as DOE may elect to charge for the commercial use of its inventions and discoveries including related data and technology and, except for an applicant qualifying for a permit pursuant to § 725.15(b)(3)(ii), agrees to pay $25,000 for an access permit authorizing access to restricted data in subcategory B.

      (9) Except as may be otherwise authorized by DOE, the permittee agrees not to disseminate to persons not granted access by DOE, restricted data or government confidential commercial information made available to the permittee by DOE or restricted data developed by the permittee, its employees, or others engaged by the permittee in the course of the permittee's work under the access permit or as a result of data or information made available by DOE.

      (10) The granting of an access permit does not constitute any assurance, direct or implied, that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will grant the permittee a license for a production facility or any other license.

      (11) In the event the permittee is engaged by DOE to perform work for DOE in the field of the separation of isotopes, the permittee agrees to undertake such measures as DOE may require for the separation of its activities under the access permit from its work for DOE.

#### § § 745.101

    (a) Except as detailed in § 745.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.

    (b) [Reserved]

    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.

    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.

    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.

    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the  or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.

    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.  Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the  or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.

    (j) Federal guidance on the requirements of this policy shall be issued only after consultation, for the purpose of harmonization (to the extent appropriate), with other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, unless such consultation is not feasible.

Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:

    (1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.

    (2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 745.111(a)(7).

    (3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 745.111(a)(7).

    (ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.

    (iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.

    (4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;

    (ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;

    (iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or

    (iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501

    (5) Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of department or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or service programs, including procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs, possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures, or possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.

    (i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies:

    (i) If wholesome foods without additives are consumed, or

    (ii) If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (7) Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for potential secondary research use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by § 745.111(a)(8).

    (8) Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following criteria are met:

    (i) Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens was obtained in accordance with § 745.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent was obtained in accordance with § 745.117;

    (iii) An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination required by § 745.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and (iv) The investigator does not include returning individual research results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual research results.

    §§ 745.105-745.106   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 745.105-745.106

    § 745.107   IRB membership.

#### § § 745.107

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.

    (b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.

    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.

    (d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.

    (e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.

    § 745.108   IRB functions and operations.

#### § § 745.108

    (a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:

    (1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;

    (2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant;

    (3) Establish and follow written procedures for:

    (i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution;

    (ii) Determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and

    (iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the research activity in accordance with the terms of the IRB approval until any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.

    (4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency of

    (i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB; and

    (ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.

    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described in § 745.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.

    § 745.109   IRB review of research.

#### § § 745.109

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities under § 745.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption (under § 745.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7), and (8)).

    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of informed consent is in accordance with § 745.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in § 745.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.

    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with § 745.117.

    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.

    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research requiring review by the convened IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, not less than once per year, except as described in § 745.109(f).

    (f)(1) Unless an IRB determines otherwise, continuing review of research is not required in the following circumstances:

    (i) Research eligible for expedited review in accordance with § 745.110;

    (ii) Research reviewed by the IRB in accordance with the limited IRB review described in § 745.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8);

    (iii) Research that has progressed to the point that it involves only one or both of the following, which are part of the IRB-approved study:

    (A) Data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, or

    (B) Accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care.

    (2) [Reserved]

    (g) An IRB shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.

    § 745.110   Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

#### § § 745.110

    (a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the  a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the  for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.

    (b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:

    (i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;

    (ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or

    (iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 745.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).

    (2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 745.108(b).

    (c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.

    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.

    § 745.111   Criteria for IRB approval of research.

#### § § 745.111

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:

    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized:

    (i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and

    (ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.

    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research ( the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.

    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 745.116.

    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 745.117.

    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.

    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 745.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:

    (i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 745.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 745.117; and

    (iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.

    § 745.112   Review by Institution

#### § § 745.112

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.

    § 745.113   Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.

#### § § 745.113

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

    § 745.114   Cooperative Research.

#### § § 745.114

    (a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.

    (b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.

    (2) The following research is not subject to this provision:

    (i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or

    (ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.

    (c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.

    § 745.115   IRB Records.

#### § § 745.115

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the following:

    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent forms, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.

    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings, which shall be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.

    (3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would not require continuing review as described in § 745.109(f)(1).

    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the investigators.

    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described in § 745.108(a)(2).

    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in § 745.108(a)(3) and (4).

    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as required by § 745.116(c)(5).

    (8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under § 745.110(b)(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review list described in § 745.110(a) is more than minimal risk.

    (9) Documentation specifying the responsibilities that an institution and an organization operating an IRB each will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, as described in § 745.103(e).

    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The institution or IRB may maintain the records in printed form, or electronically. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the Federal department or agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

    § 745.116   General Requirements for Informed Consent.

#### § § 745.116

    (a)  General requirements for informed consent, whether written or oral, are set forth in this paragraph and apply to consent obtained in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Broad consent may be obtained in lieu of informed consent obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section only with respect to the storage, maintenance, and secondary research uses of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens. Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local officials is described in paragraph (e) of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy:

    (1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.

    (3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the legally authorized representative.

    (4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.

    (5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:

    (i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.

    (ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.

    (6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.

    (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:

    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures that are experimental;

    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject;

    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research;

    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;

    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;

    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained;

    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject;

    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled; and

    (9) One of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens:

    (i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecimens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or

    (ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecimens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.

    (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, one or more of the following elements of information, when appropriate, shall also be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:

    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) that are currently unforeseeable;

    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's or the legally authorized representative's consent;

    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research;

    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject;

    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject;

    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study;

    (7) A statement that the subject's biospecimens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit;

    (8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and

    (9) For research involving biospecimens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing ( sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).

    (d)  Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens (collected for either research studies other than the proposed research or nonresearch purposes) is permitted as an alternative to the informed consent requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If the subject or the legally authorized representative is asked to provide broad consent, the following shall be provided to each subject or the subject's legally authorized representative:

    (1) The information required in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), and (b)(8) and, when appropriate, (c)(7) and (9) of this section;

    (2) A general description of the types of research that may be conducted with the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens. This description must include sufficient information such that a reasonable person would expect that the broad consent would permit the types of research conducted;

    (3) A description of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens that might be used in research, whether sharing of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens might occur, and the types of institutions or researchers that might conduct research with the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens;

    (4) A description of the period of time that the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens may be stored and maintained (which period of time could be indefinite), and a description of the period of time that the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens may be used for research purposes (which period of time could be indefinite);

    (5) Unless the subject or legally authorized representative will be provided details about specific research studies, a statement that they will not be informed of the details of any specific research studies that might be conducted using the subject's identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, including the purposes of the research, and that they might have chosen not to consent to some of those specific research studies;

    (6) Unless it is known that clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to the subject in all circumstances, a statement that such results may not be disclosed to the subject; and

    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about the subject's rights and about storage and use of the subject's identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related harm.

    § 745.117   Documentation of informed consent.

#### § § 745.117

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:

    (1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 745.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 745.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 745.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.

    (c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:

    (i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;

    (ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or

    (iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

    (2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.

    § 745.118   Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

#### § § 745.118

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 745.101(i) or exempted under § 745.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.

    § 745.119   Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.

#### § § 745.119

    Except for research waived under § 745.101(i) or exempted under § 745.104, in the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.

    § 745.120   Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.

#### § § 745.120

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.

    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one.

    § 745.121   [Reserved]

#### § § 745.121

    § 745.122   Use of Federal funds.

#### § § 745.122

    Federal funds administered by a Federal department or agency may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements of this policy have been satisfied.

    § 745.123   Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.

#### § § 745.123

    (a) The department or agency head may require that Federal department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with the terms of this policy.

    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to federal regulation).

    § 745.124   Conditions.

#### § § 745.124

    With respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.

  PART 760—DOMESTIC URANIUM PROGRAM

### Part 760

    § 760.1   Uranium leases on lands controlled by DOE. (Domestic Uranium Program Circular No. 760.1, formerly (AEC) Domestic Uranium Program Circular 8, 10 CFR 60.8).

#### § § 760.1

    (a)  This section sets forth regulations governing the issuance of leases to permit the exploration for and mining of deposits containing uranium in public lands withdrawn from entry and location under the general mining laws for use of DOE, and in certain other lands under DOE control.

    (b)  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (68 Stat. 919, 42 U.S.C. 2011 ) is the authority for this section.

    (c)  Only parties who are (1) citizens of the United States; (2) associations of such citizens; or (3) corporations organized under the laws of the United States or territories thereof, are eligible lessees under this section. Persons under 21 years of age or employees of DOE are not eligible.

    (d)  Except under special circumstances as provided in paragraph (u) of this section, each lease will be offered through competitive bidding and, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), will be issued to the acceptable bidder offering the highest bid. The bid may be on a cash bonus, royalty bonus, or other basis as specified in the invitation to bid. Invitations to bid on some of the lands may be limited to small business concerns as defined by the Small Business Administration, and such invitations may limit the number of leases to be awarded to each bidder. In such cases DOE will accept those bids which, in relation to other bids received pursuant to the invitation, are most advantageous to the Government. Before any lease is awarded, DOE may require high bidders to submit a detailed statement of the facts as to such matters as their experience, organization, and financial resources. DOE reserves the right to reject any and all bids.

    (e)  Announcements of the availability of invitations to bid for a lease will be publicly posted and published. Copies of such announcements will also be mailed to parties who submit to DOE's Grand Junction, Colorado, Office subsequent to publication in the  of this (DOE) Domestic Uranium Program Circular 760.1, written requests that their names be placed on a mailing list for receipt of such announcements. The invitations containing information for preparation and submission of bids will be available at the Grand Junction Office, and will be mailed only on specific written request, following announcement of their availability. Invitations will specify the land to be leased, the basis on which bids are to be submitted, the amount of the monetary deposit which must be transmitted with the bid, the place and time the bids will be publicly opened, the term, royalty and other payments, performance requirements, and other payments, performance requirements, and other conditions which will become a part of the lease. In addition, data which have been assembled pertaining to the lands to be leased will be available for public inspection at the Grand Junction Office; copies will also be available for purchase.

    (f)  All bids must be filed at the place and prior to the time set forth in the invitation. Each bid must be sealed and accompanied by a deposit, in the form of a certified check, cashier's check, or bank draft, in an amount as specified in the invitation to bid. Deposits of unsuccessful bidders will be returned. If the bidder is an individual, he must submit with his bid a statement of his citizenship and age. If the bidder is an association (including a partnership), the bid shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the articles of association together with a statement as to the citizenship and age of its members. If the bidder is a corporation, evidence that the officer signing the bid had authority to do so and a statement as to the State of incorporation shall also be submitted.

    (g)  Following public opening of the bids, DOE, subject to the right to reject any and all bids, will determine the successful bidder. In the event the highest acceptable bids are tie bids, a public drawing will be held by DOE to determine the successful bidder. After notice of award and within the time period prescribed in the invitation, the successful bidder shall execute and return to DOE three (3) copies of the lease and shall remit payments due as prescribed in the invitation. Should the successful bidder fail to execute the lease, or make payments as required, in accordance with the terms of the invitation, or fail to otherwise comply with applicable regulations, he may be required to forfeit any payments previously made, and lose any further right or interest in the lease. In such event, DOE may offer the lease to the next highest acceptable bidder, reoffer the lease for bidding, or take such other action as appropriate. If the awarded lease is executed by the bidder through an agent, evidence of authorization must be submitted.

    (h)  A lease issued under this section will ordinarily be effective as of the date it is signed on behalf of DOE.

    (i)  A lease shall be for the period specified in the invitation to bid. When deemed desirable by DOE, the lease will provide that the lease term may be extended at the option of the lessee for a specified period and upon stipulated conditions.

    (j)  Royalty payments shall be specified in the invitation to bid; base royalty, minimum royalty, advance royalty, and rental payments, or a combination thereof may be required.

    (k)  DOE, unless it approves otherwise, reserves all right and title to property in and to all ores and other uranium- or vanadium-bearing material not removed from the leased premises within 60 days after expiration or other termination of the lease. Unless DOE approves otherwise, all material mined from the leased premises and not marketed by the lessee shall remain on the leased premises.

    (l)  Each lease will contain such provisions as may be deemed necessary by DOE with respect to the lessee's use of the leased lands. DOE may require periodic submission of plans for exploration and mining activities including provisions for control of environmental impact. The lessee will be required to conduct operations so as to minimize adverse environmental effects, to comply with all applicable State and Federal statutes and regulations and to the extent stipulated in the lease agreement, will be held responsible for maintenance or rehabilitation of affected areas in accordance with plans submitted to and approved by DOE.

    (m)  A lease shall require that exploration, development, and mining activities, as appropriate, be conducted on the leased premises with reasonable diligence, skill, and care as required to achieve and maintain production of uranium ore at rates consistent with good and safe mining practice and with market conditions.

    (n)  A lease (1) shall require that exploration, development, and mining activities, as appropriate, be conducted on the leased premises with due regard for the health and safety of those involved, and (2) shall include appropriate measures for the control of radiation exposure in the mines.

    (o)  Leases shall provide that the lessee keep and make available to DOE such records as DOE deems necessary for the administration of the lease and its leasing program.

    (p)  DOE reserves the right to enter upon the leased property and into all parts of the mine for inspection and other purposes. DOE also reserves the right to grant to other persons easements or rights of way upon, through, or in the leased premises. DOE and the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of 3 years after termination or expiration of lease, have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, papers, and records of the lessee involving transactions related to the lease.

    (q)  A lease may be surrendered by the lessee upon filing with and approval by DOE of a written application for relinquishment. Approval of the application shall be contingent upon the delivery of the leased premises to DOE in a condition determined to be satisfactory to DOE. The lessee shall continue to be liable for the payment of all royalty and other debts due DOE.

    (r)  Any transfer of a lease or any interest therein or claim thereunder, will not be recognized unless and until approved by DOE in writing. Ordinarily, DOE will not approve any transfer of a lease which involves overriding royalties or deferred payments of any kind to the transferor.

    (s)  Any lease may be cancelled by DOE whenever the lessee fails to comply with the provisions of the lease. Failure of DOE to exercise its right to cancel shall not be deemed a waiver thereof.

    (t)  Leases will be issued on forms prescribed by DOE.

    (u)  Under special circumstances, where DOE believes it to be in the best interest of the Government, DOE at its discretion may award or extend leases on the basis of negotiation.

    (v)  All matters connected with the issuance and administration of leases will be determined by DOE whose decisions shall be final and conclusive.

    (w)  DOE as used in this section means the United States Department of Energy or its duly authorized representative or representatives.

    (x)  Leases issued under this section shall provide that operations under them will be conducted so as not to interfere with the lawful operations of any third party having a lease, permit, easement, or other right or interest in the premises.

    (y)  Every lease shall provide that the lessee is required to comply with all applicable State and Federal statutes and regulations.

    Subpart B—Reimbursement Criteria

      § 765.10   Eligibility for reimbursement.

#### § § 765.10

      (a) Any licensee of an active uranium or thorium processing site that has incurred costs of remedial action for the site that are attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States shall be eligible for reimbursement of these costs, subject to the procedures and limitations specified in this part.

      (b) Prior to reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred by a licensee, the Department shall make a determination regarding the total quantity of dry short tons of byproduct material, and the quantity of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material present on October 24, 1992 at the licensee's active processing site. A claim for reimbursement from a site for which a determination is made will be evaluated individually. If a licensee does not concur with the Department's determination regarding the quantity of dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site, the licensee may appeal the Department's determination in accordance with § 765.22 of this part. The Department's determination shall be used to determine that portion of an approved claim for reimbursement submitted by the licensee which shall be reimbursed, unless or until the determination is overturned on appeal. If the outcome of an appeal requires a change in the Department's initial determination, the Department will adjust any payment previously made to the licensee to reflect the change.

      § 765.11   Reimbursable costs.

#### § § 765.11

      (a) Costs for which a licensee may be reimbursed must be for remedial action that a licensee demonstrates is attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States, as determined by the Department. These costs are equal to the total costs of remedial action at a site multiplied by the Federal reimbursement ratio established for the site. These costs must be incurred in the performance of activities, prior to or after enactment of UMTRCA, and required by a plan, portion thereof, or other written authorization, approved by NRC or by an Agreement State. Costs of remedial action shall be reimbursable only if approved by the Department in accordance with the provisions of this part.

      (b) In addition, costs of remedial action incurred by a licensee after December 31, 2007 must be in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department as specified in § 765.30.

      (c) Total reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred at an active processing site that are otherwise reimbursable pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be limited as follows:

      (1) Reimbursement of costs of remedial action to active uranium processing site licensees shall not exceed $6.25, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material.

      (2) Aggregate reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred at all active uranium processing sites shall not exceed $350 million. This aggregate amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 765.12; and

      (3) Reimbursement of costs of remedial action at the active thorium processing site shall be limited to costs incurred for offsite disposal and shall not exceed $365 million. This amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 765.12.

      (d) Notwithstanding the Title X requirement that byproduct material must be located at an active processing site on October 24, 1992, byproduct material moved from the Edgemont Mill in Edgemont, South Dakota, to a disposal site as a result of remedial action, shall be eligible for reimbursement in accordance with all applicable requirements of this part.

      § 765.12   Inflation index adjustment procedures.

#### § § 765.12

      (a) The amounts of $6.25 (as specified in § 765.2(e) of this rule) $350 million (as specified in § 765.2(f) of this rule), $365 million (as specified in § 765.2(g) of this rule) and $715 million (as specified in § 765.2(i) of this rule) shall be adjusted for inflation as provided by this section.

      (b) To make adjustments for inflation to the amounts specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall apply the CPI-U to these amounts annually, beginning in 1994, using the CPI-U as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the Department of Commerce for the preceding calendar year.

      (c) The Department shall adjust annually, using the CPI-U as defined in this part, amounts paid to an active uranium processing site licensee for purposes of comparison with the $6.25 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement as adjusted for inflation.

    Subpart C—Procedures for Submitting and Processing Reimbursement Claims

      § 765.20   Procedures for submitting reimbursement claims.

#### § § 765.20

      (a) All costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed must be supported by reasonable documentation as specified in this subpart. The Department reserves the right to deny any claim for reimbursement, in whole or in part, that is not submitted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

      (b) The licensee shall provide a copy of the approved site reclamation plan or other written authorization from NRC or an Agreement State upon which claims for reimbursement are based, with the initial claim submitted. Any revision or modification made to the plan or other written authorization, which is approved by NRC or an Agreement State, shall be included by the licensee in the next claim submitted to the Department following that revision or modification. This reclamation plan or other written authorization, as modified or revised, shall serve as the basis for the Department's evaluation of all claims for reimbursement submitted by a licensee.

      (c) Each submitted claim shall provide a summary of all costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed. This summary shall identify the costs of remedial action associated with each major activity or requirement established by the site's reclamation plan or other written authorization. In addition, each claim shall provide a summary of the documentation relied upon by the licensee in support of each cost category for which reimbursement is claimed.

      (d) Documentation used to support a reimbursement claim must demonstrate that the costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed were incurred specifically for activities specified in the site's reclamation plan, or otherwise authorized by NRC or an Agreement State. Summary documentation used in support of a claim must be cross-referenced to the relevant page and activity of the licensee's reclamation plan, or other written authorization approved by NRC or an Agreement State.

      (1) Documentation prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred should be used when available. The documentation should identify the date or time period for which the cost was incurred, the activity for which the cost was incurred, and the reclamation plan provision or other written authorization to which the cost relates. Where available, each claim should be supported by receipts, invoices, pay records, or other documents that substantiate that each specific cost for which reimbursement is claimed was incurred for work that was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or applicable Agreement State requirements.

      (2) Documentation not prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred, or not directly related to activities specified in the reclamation plan or other written authorization, may be used in support of a claim for reimbursement provided that the licensee determines the documentation is the only means available to document costs for which reimbursement is sought.

      (e) The Department may audit, or require the licensee to audit, any documentation used to support a claim on a case-by-case basis and may approve, approve in part, or deny reimbursement of any claim in accordance with the requirements of this part. Documentation relied upon by a licensee in support of a claim for reimbursement shall be made available to the Department and retained by the licensee until 4 years after final payment of a claim is made by the Department.

      (f) Each licensee should utilize generally accepted accounting principles consistently throughout the claim. These accounting principles, underlying assumptions, and any other information necessary for the Department to evaluate the claim shall be set forth in each claim.

      (g) Following each annual appropriation by Congress, the Department will issue a  Notice announcing:

      (1) A claim submission deadline for that fiscal year;

      (2) Availability of funds for reimbursement of costs of remedial action;

      (3) Whether the Department anticipates that approved claims for that fiscal year may be subject to prorated payment;

      (4) Any changes in the Federal reimbursement ratio or maximum reimbursement ceiling for any active uranium or thorium processing site;

      (5) Any revision in the per dry short ton limit on reimbursement for all active uranium processing sites; and

      (6) Any other relevant information.

      (h) A licensee shall certify, with respect to any claim submitted by it for reimbursement, that the work was completed as described in an approved reclamation plan or other authorization. In addition, the licensee shall certify that all costs for which reimbursement is claimed, all documentation relied upon in support of its costs, and all statements or representations made in the claim are complete, accurate, and true. The certification shall be signed by an officer or other official of the licensee with knowledge of the contents of the claim and authority to represent the licensee in making the certification. Any knowingly false or frivolous statements or representations may subject the individual to penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 of title 31 United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; and criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001 and 1002 of title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority.

      (i) All claims for reimbursement submitted to the Department shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The Department reserves all rights under applicable law to recover any funds paid to licensees which an audit finds to not meet the requirements of this part.

      § 765.21   Procedures for processing reimbursement claims.

#### § § 765.21

      (a) The Department will conduct a preliminary review of each claim within 60 days after the claim submission deadline announced in the  Notice specified in § 765.20(g) to determine the completeness of each claim. Payments from the Fund to active uranium or thorium processing site licensees for approved costs of remedial action will be made simultaneously by the Department within 1 year of the claim submission deadline.

      (b) After completing the preliminary review specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department may audit, or require the licensee to audit, any documentation used in support of such claim, request the licensee to provide additional information, or request the licensee to provide other clarification determined by the Department to be necessary to complete its evaluation of the claim. In addition, the Department reserves the right to conduct an inspection of the site to verify any information provided by the licensee in a claim for reimbursement, or in support thereof. Any information requested by the Department, if provided, must be submitted by the claimant within 60 days of receipt of the request unless the Department specifies in writing that additional time is provided.

      (c) At any time during the review of a claim, the Department may request an informal conference with a licensee to obtain further information or clarification on any unresolved issue pertaining to the claim. While the licensee is not required to provide additional clarification requested by the Department, a failure to do so may result in the denial of that portion of the claim for which information is requested.

      (d) Based upon the claim submitted and any additional information received by the Department, including any audit or site inspection if conducted, the Department shall complete a final review of all relevant information prior to making a reimbursement decision. When the Department determines it is not clear that an activity for which reimbursement is claimed was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements, the Department may consult with the appropriate regulatory authorities.

      (e) A written decision regarding the Department's determination to approve, approve in part, or deny a claim will be provided to the licensee within 10 days of completion of the claim review. Within 45 days after the Department's issuance of a written decision to deny the claim due to inadequate documentation, the licensee may request the Department to reconsider its decision if the licensee provides reasonable documentation in accordance with § 765.20. If a licensee chooses not to submit the documentation, the licensee has the right to file a formal appeal to a claim denial in accordance with § 765.22. If a licensee chooses to submit the documentation, the Department will consider whether the documentation results in the Department's reversal of the initial decision to deny the claim and will inform the licensee of the Department's subsequent decision. The licensee may appeal that decision in accordance with § 765.22.

      (f) If the Department determines that insufficient funds are available at any time to provide for complete payment of all outstanding approved claims, reimbursements of approved claims will be made on a prorated basis. A prorated payment of all outstanding approved claims for reimbursement, or any unpaid portion thereof, shall be made on the basis of the total amount of all outstanding approved claims, regardless of when the claims were submitted or approved.

      (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, or any other provisions of this part, any requirement for the payment or obligation of funds by the Department established by this part shall be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and no provision herein shall be interpreted to require obligation or payment of funds in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).

      § 765.22   Appeals procedures.

#### § § 765.22

      (a) Any appeal by a licensee of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part, shall invoke the appeals process specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) A licensee shall file an appeal of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Any appeal must be filed within 45 days from the date the licensee received notice, actual or constructive (i.e., publication in the ), of the Department's determination. Appeals must comply with the procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C. The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final decision of the Department. A licensee must file an appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies, and the receipt of an appellate decision is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of any determination made under this part.

    Subpart D—Additional Reimbursement Procedures

      § 765.30   Reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action.

#### § § 765.30

      (a) This section establishes procedures governing reimbursements of costs of remedial action incurred in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department as provided in this section. Costs otherwise eligible for reimbursement in accordance with the terms of this part and incurred in accordance with the plan shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of subpart D and subpart C. In the event there is an inconsistency between the requirements of subpart D and subpart C, the provisions of subpart D shall govern reimbursement of such costs of remedial action.

      (b) A licensee who anticipates incurring costs of remedial action after December 31, 2007 may submit a plan for subsequent remedial action. This plan may be submitted at any time after January 1, 2005, but no later than December 31, 2006. Reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred after December 31, 2007 shall be subject to the approval of this plan by the Department. This plan shall describe:

      (1) All applicable requirements established by NRC pursuant to UMTRCA, or where appropriate, by the requirements of an Agreement State, included in a reclamation plan approved by NRC or an Agreement State which have not yet been satisfied in full by the licensee, and

      (2) The total cost of remedial action required at the site, together with all necessary supporting documentation, segregated into actual costs incurred to date, costs incurred or expected to be incurred prior to December 31, 2007 but not yet approved for reimbursement, and anticipated future costs.

      (c) The Department shall review the plan for subsequent remedial action to verify conformance with the NRC- or Agreement State-approved reclamation plan or other written authorization, and to determine the reasonableness of anticipated future costs, and shall approve, approve with suggested modifications, or reject the plan. During its review, the Department may request additional information from the licensee to clarify or provide support for any provision or estimate contained in the plan. The Department may also consult with NRC or an Agreement State concerning any provision or estimate contained in the plan. Upon approval, approval with modifications, or rejection of a plan, the Department shall inform and explain to the licensee its decision.

      (d) If the Department rejects a plan for subsequent remedial action submitted by a licensee, the licensee may appeal the Department's rejection or prepare and submit a revised plan. The licensee may continue to submit revised plans for subsequent remedial action until the Department approves a plan, or September 30, 2007, whichever occurs first. A failure by a licensee to receive approval from the Department of a plan prior to December 31, 2007 will preclude that licensee from receiving any reimbursement for costs of remedial action incurred after that date.

      (e) The Department shall determine, in approving a plan for subsequent remedial action, the maximum reimbursement amount for which the licensee may be eligible. This maximum reimbursement amount shall be the smaller of the following two quantities:

      (1) The amount obtained by multiplying the total cost of remedial action at the site, as determined in the approved plan for subsequent remedial action, by the Federal reimbursement ratio established for such site; or

      (2) For the uranium site licensees only, $6.25, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. For all licensees, the Department shall subtract from the maximum reimbursement amount any reimbursement already approved to be paid to the licensee. The resulting sum shall be the potential additional reimbursement to which the licensee may be entitled. This resulting sum will be adjusted after the approval of claims for work performed through December 31, 2007, to reflect the actual approved costs of work performed through that date.

      § 765.31   Designation of funds available for subsequent remedial action.

#### § § 765.31

      (a) The Department shall authorize reimbursement of costs of remedial action, incurred in accordance with an approved plan for subsequent remedial action and approved by the Department as specified in subpart C to this part, to be made from the Fund. These costs are reimbursable until:

      (1) This remedial action has been completed, or

      (2) The licensee has been reimbursed its maximum reimbursement amount as determined by the Department pursuant to paragraph (e) of § 765.30.

      (b) A licensee shall submit any claim for reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred pursuant to an approved plan for subsequent remedial action in accordance with the requirements of subpart C of this part. The Department shall approve, approve in part, or deny any claims in accordance with the procedures specified in subpart C of this part. The Department shall authorize the disbursement of funds upon approval of a claim for reimbursement.

      (c) After all remedial actions have been completed by affected Agreement State or NRC licensees, the Department will issue a  notice announcing a termination date beyond which claims for reimbursement will no longer be accepted.

      § 765.32   Reimbursement of excess funds.

#### § § 765.32

      (a) No later than December 31, 2008, the Department shall determine if the aggregate amount authorized for appropriation pursuant to section 1003 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-2), as adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 765.12, exceed as of that date the combined total of all reimbursements which have been paid to licensees under this part, any amounts approved for reimbursement and owed to any licensee, and any anticipated additional reimbursements to be made in accordance with approved plans for subsequent remedial action.

      (b) If the Department determines that the amount authorized pursuant to section 1003 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-2), as adjusted for inflation, exceed the combined total of all reimbursements (as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section), the Department may establish procedures for providing additional reimbursement to uranium licensees for costs of remedial action, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. If the amount of available excess funds is insufficient to provide reimbursement of all eligible costs of remedial action, then reimbursement shall be paid on a prorated basis.

      (c) Each eligible uranium licensee's prorated share will be determined by dividing the total excess funds available by the total number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site where costs of remedial action exceed $6.25 per dry short ton, as adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 765.12. The resulting number will be the maximum cost per dry short ton, over $6.25, that may be reimbursed. Total reimbursement for each licensee that has incurred approved costs of remedial action in excess of $6.25 per dry short ton will be the product of the excess cost per dry short ton multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material at the site or the actual costs incurred and approved by the Department, whichever is less.

      (d) Any costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is sought from excess funds determined by the Department to be available is subject to all requirements of this part except the per dry short ton limit on reimbursement established by paragraph (d) of § 765.11.

  PART 766—URANIUM ENRICHMENT DECONTAMINATION AND DECOMMISSIONING FUND; PROCEDURES FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF DOMESTIC UTILITIES

### Part 766

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2201, 2297g, 2297g-1, 2297g-2, 7254.

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 41963, Aug. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 766.1   Purpose.

#### § § 766.1

      The provisions of this part establish procedures for the Special Assessment of domestic utilities for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund pursuant to sections 1801, 1802 and 1803 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 2011 ).

      § 766.2   Applicability.

#### § § 766.2

      This part applies to all domestic utilities in the United States that purchased separative work units from the DOE between 1945 and October 23, 1992.

      § 766.3   Definitions.

#### § § 766.3

      For the purposes of this part, the following terms shall be defined as follows:

      means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.

      means the production of electricity for sale to consumers.

      means the United States Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies.

      means any utility in the United States that has purchased SWUs produced by DOE for the purpose of commercial electrical generation during the period beginning in 1945 to October 23, 1992.

      means an account in the U.S. Treasury referred to as the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning _Fund_, established by section 1801 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

      means the _Oak Ridge Operations Office_ of the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

      means the _Special Assessment_ levied on domestic utilities for payments into the Fund.

      means a separative work unit, the common measure by which uranium enrichment services are sold.

      means the Toll Enrichment Services System, which is the database that tracks uranium enrichment services transactions of the DOE Oak Ridge Operations Office for the purpose of planning, toll transaction processing, customer invoicing and historical tracking of SWU deliveries.

      mean lease charges for the consumption of SWUs and natural uranium.

    Subpart B—Procedures for Special Assessment

      § 766.100   Scope.

#### § § 766.100

      This subpart sets forth the procedures for the Special Assessment of domestic utilities for funds to be deposited in the Fund.

      

      § 766.101   Data utilization.

#### § § 766.101

      DOE shall use the records from the Toll Enrichment Services System (TESS) and other records maintained by the Oak Ridge Operations Office in order to determine the total SWUs purchased from DOE for all purposes. DOE shall use records from TESS, relevant records of domestic utilities, and such other information as DOE deems to be reliable and probative in determining the number of SWUs that were purchased by each domestic utility prior to October 24, 1992. A domestic utility shall be considered to have purchased a SWU from DOE if the SWU was produced by DOE but purchased by the domestic utility from another source. DOE shall consider a purchase to have occurred upon the delivery of a SWU to the domestic utility purchasing the SWU. A domestic utility shall not be considered to have purchased a SWU from DOE if the SWU was purchased by the domestic utility but subsequently sold to another source.

      

      § 766.102   Calculation methodology.

#### § § 766.102

      (a)  Domestic utilities shall be assessed annually for their share of the Fund. The amount of the assessment shall be determined by the ratio of SWUs produced by DOE and purchased by domestic utilities prior to October 24, 1992, to the total number of SWUs produced by DOE for all purposes (including SWUs produced for defense purposes). All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. This ratio is expressed by the following hypothetical example:

      (b)  The Annual Special Assessment ratio calculated in paragraph (a) of this section shall be multiplied by $480 million, yielding the total amount of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment as of October 1992. In the event that this amount is in excess of $150 million, the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment shall be capped at $150 million. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. The Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment is determined as shown in the following hypothetical example:

      (c)  The ratio of the total number of SWUs purchased by an individual domestic utility for commercial electricity generation, to the total number of SWUs purchased by all domestic utilities for commercial electricity generation, multiplied by the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, determines an individual utility's share of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a calculation follows:

      (d)  The Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment billed to domestic utilities shall be adjusted for inflation using the most recently published monthly CPI-U and the CPI-U for October 1992. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a calculation follows:

      § 766.103   Special Assessment invoices.

#### § § 766.103

      (a) DOE shall issue annually a Special Assessment invoice to each domestic utility. This invoice will specify itemized quantities of enrichment services by reactor. In each Special Assessment invoice, DOE shall require payment, on or before 30 days from the date of each invoice, of that utility's prorated share of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment, as adjusted for inflation using the most recently published monthly CPI-U data.

      (b) DOE shall enclose with the Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment invoice a sealed, business confidential, summary SWU transaction statement including:

      (1) TESS information which documents, by reactor, the basis of the utility's assessment;

      (2) A list of domestic utilities subject to the Special Assessment;

      (3) The total number of SWUs purchased from DOE by all domestic utilities for all purposes prior to October 24, 1992.

      (4) The total number of SWUs purchased from DOE for all purposes prior to October 24, 1992, including SWUs purchased or produced for defense purposes; and

      (5) Such other information as may be appropriate.

      (c) With regard to any fiscal year after Fiscal Year 1993, DOE shall enclose a summary SWU transaction statement with Special Assessment invoices that will include updated information regarding adjustments to Special Assessments resulting from the reconciliation and appeals process under Section 766.104.

      (d) The date of each Annual Special Assessment invoicing will be set on or about October 1 with payment due 30 calendar days from the date of invoice starting with the Fiscal Year 1995 Special Assessment.

      § 766.104   Reconciliation, adjustments and appeals.

#### § § 766.104

      (a) A domestic utility requesting an adjustment shall, within 30 days from the date of a Special Assessment invoice, file a notice requesting an adjustment. Such notice shall include an explanation of the basis for the adjustment and any supporting documents, and may include a request for a meeting with DOE to discuss its invoice. If more time is needed to gather probative information, DOE will consider utility requests for up to 90 days additional time, providing that the initial notice requesting an adjustment was timely filed. The notice shall be filed at the address set forth in the Special Assessment invoice, and filing of this notice is complete only upon receipt by DOE. Domestic utilities are considered to have met the filing requirements upon DOE's receipt of the notice requesting an adjustment without regard to DOE's acceptance of supporting documentation. The filing of a notice for an adjustment shall not stay the obligation to pay.

      (b) DOE may request additional information from domestic utilities and may acquire data from other sources.

      (c) After reviewing a notice submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and other relevant information, and after making any necessary adjustment to its records in light of reliable and adequately probative records submitted in connection with the request for adjustment or otherwise obtained by DOE, DOE shall make a written determination granting or denying the requested adjustment. As appropriate, DOE shall modify the application of TESS data for any discrepancies or further transactions raised during the reconciliation process.

      (d) Any domestic utility that wishes to dispute a written determination under paragraph (c) of this section shall have the right to file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, DC 20585. Except for the Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment, any appeal must be filed on or before 30 days from the date of the written determination and should contain information of the type described in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C. With regard to a written determination under paragraph (c) of this section concerning a Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment, a domestic utility must file an appeal on or before 30 days from the effective date of this paragraph or from the date of such written determination, whichever is later. The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final decision of DOE. Upon completion of the reconciliation process, all records of SWU transactions shall be finalized and shall become the basis of subsequent Special Assessment invoices. These records shall be revised to reflect any decisions from the Office of Hearings and Appeals and any applicable court rulings.

      § 766.106   Late payment fees.

#### § § 766.106

      In the case of a late payment by a domestic utility of its Special Assessment, the domestic utility shall pay interest at the per annum rate (365-day basis) established by DOE for general application to monies due DOE and not received by DOE on or before a designated due date. Interest shall accrue beginning the date of the designated payment except that, whenever the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a United States legal holiday, interest shall commence on the next day immediately following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or United States legal holiday. Late payment provisions for the Special Assessment to the Fund shall be based on the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate (which is published annually by the Treasury and used in assessing interest charges for outstanding debts on claims owed to the United States Government), plus six (6) percent pro rata on a daily basis. The additional six (6) percent charge shall not go into effect until five (5) business days after payment was originally due. Late payment fees shall be invoiced within two days of receipt of utility payment of the special assessment when delinquency is less than 30 days. For longer periods of delinquency, DOE will submit additional invoices, as appropriate. Late payment fees will be due 30 days from the date of invoice.

      § 766.107   Prepayment of future Special Assessments

#### § § 766.107

      DOE shall accept prepayment of future Special Assessments upon request by a domestic utility. A domestic utility's liability for the future assessments shall be satisfied to the extent of the prepayments. DOE shall use the pro rata share of prepayments attributable to a given fiscal year plus the Special Assessments collected from utilities who did not prepay for that fiscal year, in order to determine that the total amount of Special Assessments collected from domestic utilities in a given fiscal year does not exceed $150 million, annually adjusted for inflation.

      (2) A request, either expressed or implied, for compensation;

      (3) A citation of the patents or copyrighted items alleged to be infringed;

      (4) In the case of a patent infringement claim, a sufficiently specific designation to permit identification of the items or processes alleged to infringe the patents, giving the commercial designation if known to the claimant, or, in the case of a copyright infringement claim, the acts alleged to infringe the copyright;

      (5) In the case of a patent infringement claim, a designation of at least one claim of each patent alleged to be infringed or, in the case of a copyright infringement claim, a copy of each work alleged to be infringed;

      (6) As an alternative to paragraphs (a) (4) and (5) of this section, certification that the claimant has made a bona fide attempt to determine the items or processes which are alleged to infringe the patents, or the acts alleged to infringe the copyrights, but was unable to do so, giving reasons, and stating a reasonable basis for the claimant's belief that the patents or copyrighted items are being infringed.

      (b)  In addition to the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section the following material and information generally is necessary in the course of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are encouraged to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to permit rapid processing and resolution of the claim.

      (1) A copy of the asserted patents and identification of all claims of the patents alleged to be infringed.

      (2) Identification of all procurements known to claimant that involve the accused items or processes, including the identity of the vendors or contractors and the Government acquisition activity or activities.

      (3) A detailed identification and description of the accused articles or processes, particularly where the articles or processes relate to components or subcomponents of the item acquired, and an element-by-element comparison of representative claims with the accused articles or processes. If available, the identification and description should include documentation and drawings to illustrate the accused articles or processes in sufficient detail to enable verification that the claims of the asserted patents read on the accused articles or processes.

      (4) Names and addresses of all past and present licensees under the patents and copies of all license agreements and releases involving the patents.

      (5) A brief description of all litigation in which the patents have been or are now involved, and their present status.

      (7) A description of Government employment or military service, if any, by the inventors or patent owner.

      (8) A list of all contracts between the Government and inventors, patent owner, or anyone in privity with them that were in effect at the time of conception or actual reduction to practice of the inventions covered by the patents.

      (9) Evidence of title to the asserted patents or other right to make the claim.

      (10) If it is available to claimant, a copy of the Patent Office file of each patent.

      (11) Pertinent prior art of which the claimant has become aware after issuance of the asserted patents.

      In addition to the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused articles or processes, or to a specific acquisition (e.g. identified contracts), it may speed disposition of the claim.

      (c)  In the course of investigating a claim, it may become necessary for the Department of Energy to request information in the control and custody of claimant that is relevant to the disposition of the claim. Failure of the claimant to respond to a request for such information may be sufficient reason alone for denying a claim.

    (l) The small business status of the contractor, under an agreement not governed by Chapter 18 of Title 35, United States Code; and,

    (m) Such other considerations, such as benefit to the U.S. economy that the Secretary or designee may deem appropriate.

    § 784.6   National security considerations for waiver of certain sensitive inventions.

#### § § 784.6

    (a) Whenever, in the course of or under any Government contract or subcontract of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program or the nuclear weapons programs or other atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy, a contractor makes an invention or discovery to which title vests in the Department of Energy pursuant to statute, the contractor may request waiver of any or all of the Government's property rights. The Secretary of Energy or designee may decide to waive the Government's rights.

    (b) In making a decision under this section, the Secretary or designee shall consider, in addition to the objectives of DOE waiver policy as specified in § 784.3(a)(1) through (4), and the considerations specified in § 784.4 for advance waivers, and § 784.5 for waiver of identified inventions, the following:

    (1) Whether national security will be compromised;

    (2) Whether sensitive technical information (whether classified or unclassified) under the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program or the nuclear weapons programs or other atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy for which dissemination is controlled under Federal statutes and regulations will be released to unauthorized persons;

    (3) Whether an organizational conflict of interest contemplated by Federal statutes and regulations will result, and

    (4) Whether waiving such rights will adversely affect the operation of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program or the nuclear weapons programs or other atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy.

    (c) A decision under this § 784.6 shall be made within 150 days after the date on which a complete request for waiver, as described by paragraph (d) of this section, has been submitted to the Patent Counsel by the contractor.

    (d) In addition to the requirements for content which apply generally to all waiver requests under paragraph (a) of this section, a requestor must include a full and detailed statement of facts, to the extent known by or available to the requestor, directed to the considerations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable. To be considered complete, a waiver request must contain sufficient information, in addition to the content requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, to allow the Secretary or designee to make a decision under this section. For advance waiver requests, such information shall include, at a minimum:

    (1) An identification of all of the requestor's contractual arrangements involving the Government (including contracts, subcontracts, grants, or other arrangements) in which the technology involved in the contract was developed or used and any other funding of the technology by the Government, whether direct or indirect, involving any other party, of which the requestor is aware;

    (2) A description of the requestor's past, current, and future private investment in and development of the technology which is the subject of the contract. This includes expenditures not reimbursed by the Government on research and development which will directly benefit the work to be performed under the instant contract, the amount and percentage of contract costs to be shared by the requestor, the out-of-pocket costs of facilities or equipment to be made available by the requestor for performance of the contract work which are not charged directly or indirectly to the Government under contract, and the contractor's plans and intentions to further develop and commercialize the technology at private expense;

    (3) A description of competitive technologies or other factors which would ameliorate any anticompetitive effect of granting the waiver.

    (4) Identification of whether the contract pertains to work that is classified, or sensitive, i.e., unclassified but controlled pursuant to section 148 of the Atomic Energy Action of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2168), or subject to export control under Chapter 17 of the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) contained in Department of Defense Directive 5230.25 including identification of all principal uses of the subject matter of the contract, whether inside or outside the contractor program, and an indication of whether any such uses involve classified or sensitive technologies.

    (5) Identification of all DOE and DOD programs and projects in the same general technology as the contract for which the requestor intends to be providing program planning advice or has provided program planning advice within the last three years.

    (e) For identified invention requests under this section, such requests shall include at a minimum:

    (1) A brief description of the intentions of the requestor (or its present or intended licensee) to commercialize the invention. This description should include:

    (i) Estimated expenditures,

    (ii) Anticipated steps,

    (iii) The associated time periods to bring the invention to commercialization, and

    (iv) A statement that requestor (or its present or intended licensee) has the capability to carry out its stated intentions.

    (2) A description of any continuing Government funding of the development of the invention (including investigation of materials or processes for use therewith), from whatever Government source, whether direct or indirect, and, to the extent known by the requestor, any anticipated future Government funding to further develop the invention.

    (3) A description of competitive technologies or other factors which would ameliorate any anticompetitive effects of granting the waiver.

    (4) A statement as to whether or not the requestor would be willing to reimburse the Department of Energy for any and all costs and fees incurred by the Department in the preparation and prosecution of the patent applications covering the invention that is the subject of the waiver request.

    (5) Where applicable, a statement of reasons why the request was not timely filed in accordance with the applicable patent rights clause of the contract, or why a request for an extension of time to file the request was not filed in a timely manner.

    (6) Identification of whether the invention pertains to work that is classified, or sensitive, i.e., unclassified but controlled pursuant to section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2168), or subject to export control under Chapter 17 of the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) contained in Department of Defense Directive 5230.25, including identification of all principal uses of the invention inside or outside the contractor program, and an indication of whether any such uses involve classified or sensitive technologies.

    (7) Identification of all DOE and DOD programs and projects in the same general technology as the invention for which the requestor intends to be providing program planning advice or has provided program planning advice within the last three years.

    (8) A statement of whether a classification review of the invention disclosure, any resulting patent application(s), and/or any reports and other documents disclosing a substantial portion of the invention, has been made, together with any determinations on the existence of classified or sensitive information in either the invention disclosure, the patent application(s), or reports or other documents disclosing a substantial portion of the invention; and

    (9) Identification of any and all proposals, work for other activities, or other arrangements submitted by the requestor, DOE, or a third party, of which requestor is aware, which may involve further funding of the work on the invention at either the contractor facility where the invention arose or another facility owned by the Government.

    (f) Patent Counsel will notify the requestor promptly if the waiver request is found not to be a complete request and, in that event, will provide the requestor with a reasonable period, not to exceed 60 days, to correct any such incompleteness. If requestor does not respond within the allotted time period, the waiver request will be considered to be withdrawn. If requestor responds within the allotted time period, but the submittal is still deemed incomplete or insufficient, the waiver request may be denied.

    (g) As set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, waiver decisions shall be made within 150 days after the date on which a complete request for waiver of such rights, as specified in this section, has been submitted by the requestor to the DOE Patent Counsel. If the original waiver request does not result in a communication from DOE Patent Counsel indicating that the request is incomplete, the 150-day period for decision commences on the date of receipt of the waiver request. If the original waiver request results in a communication from DOE Patent Counsel indicating that the request is incomplete, the 150-day period for decision commences on the date on which supplementary information is received by Patent Counsel sufficient to make the waiver request complete. For advance waiver requests, if requestor is not notified that the request is incomplete, the 150-day period for decision commences on the date of receipt of the request, or on the date on which negotiation of contract terms is completed, whichever is later.

    (h) Failure of DOE to make a patent waiver decision within the prescribed 150-day period shall in no way be construed as a grant of the waiver.

    § 784.7   Class waiver.

#### § § 784.7

    This section covers relinquishing of patent title rights by the Government to a class of persons or to a class of inventions. The authorization for class waivers is to be found at 42 U.S.C. 5908(c). Class waivers may be appropriate in situations where all members of a particular class would likely qualify for an advance or identified invention waiver. Normally, class waivers are originated by the Department. However, any person with a direct and substantial interest in a DOE program may request a class waiver by forwarding a written request therefor to the Patent Counsel. While no particular format for requesting a class waiver is prescribed, any request for a class waiver and any resulting determination by the Secretary or designee must address the pertinent objectives and considerations set forth in §§ 784.3(a), 784.4, 784.5, and 784.6.

    § 784.8   Procedures.

#### § § 784.8

    (a) All requests for waivers shall be in writing. Each request for a waiver other than a class waiver shall include the information set forth in § 784.9. Such requests may be submitted by existing or prospective contractors in the case of requests for an advance waiver and by contractors, including successor contractors at a facility, or employee-inventors in the case of requests for waiver of identified inventions.

    (b) A request for an advance waiver should be submitted to the Contracting Officer (subcontractors may submit through their prime contractors) at any time prior to execution of the contract or subcontract, or within thirty days thereafter, or within such longer period as may be authorized by Patent Counsel for good cause shown in writing. If the purpose, scope, or cost of the contract is substantially altered by modification or extension after the waiver is granted, a new waiver request will be required. When advance waivers are granted, the provisions of the “Patent Rights—Waiver” clause set forth in § 784.12 shall be used in contracts which are the subject of the waivers, unless modified with the approval of the Patent Counsel to conform to the scope of the waiver granted. (See § 784.12.) Advance waivers may be requested for all inventions which may be conceived or first actually reduced to practice under a DOE contract. An advance waiver may also be requested for an identified invention conceived by the contractor before the contract but which may be first actually reduced to practice under the contract. Such waiver request must include a copy of any patent or patent application covering the identified invention, or if no patent application has been filed, a complete description of the invention.

    (c) A request for waiver (other than an advance or class waiver) for an identified invention must be submitted to the Patent Counsel at the time the invention is to be reported to DOE or not later than eight months after conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the course of or under the contract, or such longer period as may be authorized by Patent Counsel for good cause shown in writing by the requestor. The time for submitting a waiver request will not normally be extended past the time the invention has been advertised for licensing by DOE. If the Government has already filed a patent application on the invention, the requestor should indicate whether or not it is willing to reimburse the Government for the costs of searching, prosecution, filing and maintenance fees, in the event the waiver is granted.

    (d) If the request for waiver contains insufficient information, the Patent Counsel may seek additional information from the requestor and from other sources. The Patent Counsel will thoroughly analyze the request in view of each of the objectives and considerations and shall also consider the overall rights obtained by the Government in the patent, copyright, and data clauses of the contract. Where it appears that a waiver of a lesser part of the rights of the United States than requested would be more appropriate in view of the policies set forth, the Patent Counsel should attempt to negotiate a compromise acceptable to both the requestor and DOE. If approval of a waiver is recommended, Patent Counsel shall obtain an indication of agreement by the requestor to the proposed waiver scope, terms and conditions.

    (e) The Patent Counsel will prepare a Statement of Considerations setting forth the rationale for either approving or denying the waiver request and will forward the Statement to the General Counsel or designee for review thereof. While the Statement need not provide specific findings as to each and every consideration of § 784.4 or § 784.5 of this part, it will cover those that are decisive, and it will explain the basis for the recommended determination. There may be occasions when the application of the various individual considerations of § 784.4 or § 784.5 of this part to a particular case could conflict, and in those instances the conflict will be reconciled giving due regard to the overall policies set forth in 784.3(a) (1) through (4).

    (f) The Patent Counsel will also obtain comments from the appropriate DOE program organization to assist the Patent Counsel in the waiver determination. Additionally, if any other Federal Government entity has provided funding or will be providing funding, or if a subject invention has been made in whole or in part by an employee of that entity, Patent Counsel shall obtain permission to waive title to the undivided interest in the invention from the cognizant official of that entity. In situations where time does not permit a delay in contract negotiations for the preparation and mailing of a full written statement, field Patent Counsel may submit a recommendation on the waiver orally to the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property, who upon verbal consultation with the appropriate DOE program organization, shall provide a verbal decision to field Patent Counsel. All oral actions shall be promptly confirmed in writing. In approving waiver determinations, the Secretary or designee shall objectively review all requests for waiver in view of the objectives and considerations set forth in §§ 784.3 through 784.6. If the determination and the rationale therefor is not accurately reflected in the Statement of Considerations which has been submitted for approval, a new Statement of Considerations shall be prepared.

    (g) In the event that a request for advance waiver is approved after the effective date of the contract, the Patent Counsel shall promptly notify the requestor by letter of the determination and the basis therefor. The letter shall state the scope, terms and conditions of such waiver. If the terms and conditions of an approved advance waiver were not incorporated in the contract when executed, the letter shall inform the requestor that the advance waiver shall be effective as of the effective date of the contract for an advance waiver of inventions identified, i.e., conceived prior to the effective date of the contract, or as of the date the invention is reported with an election by the contractor to retain rights therein, i.e., for an invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice after the effective date of the contract; provided a copy of the letter is signed and returned to the Contracting Officer by the requestor acknowledging the acceptance of the scope, terms and conditions of the advance waiver. After acceptance by the contractor of an advance waiver, the Contracting Officer shall cause a unilateral no-cost modification to be made to the contract incorporating the terms and conditions of the waiver in lieu of previous patent rights provisions.

    (h) In the event that a waiver request is denied, the requestor may, within thirty days after notification of the denial, request reconsideration. Such a request shall include any additional facts and rationale not previously submitted which support the request. Request for reconsideration shall be submitted and processed in accordance with the procedures for submitting waiver requests set forth in this section.

    § 784.9   Content of waiver requests.

#### § § 784.9

    (a) Forms (OMB No. 1901-0800) for submitting requests for advance and identified invention waivers, indicating the necessary information, may be obtained from the Contracting Officer or Patent Counsel. All requests for advance and identified invention waivers shall include the following information:

    (1) The requestor's identification, business address, and, if represented by Counsel, the Counsel's name and address;

    (2) An identification of the pertinent contract or proposed contract and a copy of the contract Statement of Work or a nonproprietary statement which fully describes the proposed work to be performed;

    (3) The nature and extent of waiver requested;

    (4) A full and detailed statement of facts, to the extent known by or available to the requestor, directed to each of the considerations set forth in §§ 784.4 or 784.5 of this part, as applicable, and a statement applying such facts and considerations to the policies set forth in § 784.3 of this part. It is important that this submission be tailored to the unique aspects of each request for waiver, and be as complete as feasible; and

    (5) The signature of the requestor or authorized representative with the following statement: “The facts set forth in this request for waiver are within the knowledge of the requestor and are submitted with the intention that the Secretary or designee rely on them in reaching the waiver determination.”

    (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, requests for waiver of identified inventions shall include:

    (1) The full names of all inventors;

    (2) A statement of whether a patent application has been filed on the invention, together with a copy of such application if filed or, if not filed, a complete description of the invention;

    (3) If a patent application has not been filed, any information which may indicate a potential statutory bar to the patenting of the invention under 35 U.S.C. 102 or a statement that no such bar is known to exist; and

    (4) Where the requestor is the inventor, written authorization from the applicable contractor or subcontractor permitting the inventor to request a waiver.

    (c) Subject to statutes, DOE regulations, requirements, and restrictions on the treatment of proprietary and classified information; all material submitted in requests for waiver or in support thereof will be made available to the public after a determination on the waiver request has been made, regardless of whether a waiver is granted. Accordingly, requests for waiver should not normally contain information or data that the requestor is not willing to have made public. If proprietary or classified information is needed to make the waiver determination, such information shall be submitted only at the request of Patent Counsel.

    § 784.10   Record of waiver determinations.

#### § § 784.10

    The Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property shall maintain and periodically update a publicly available record of waiver determinations.

    § 784.11   Bases for granting waivers.

#### § § 784.11

    (a) The various factual situations which are appropriate for waivers cannot be categorized precisely because the appropriateness of a waiver will depend upon the manner in which the considerations set forth in §§ 784.4 or 784.5, and 784.6 if applicable, of this part relate to the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular contracting situation or the particular invention, in order to best achieve the objectives set forth in § 784.3 of this part. However, some examples where advance waivers might be appropriate are:

    (1) Cost-shared contracts;

    (2) Situations in which DOE is providing increased funding to a specific ongoing privately-sponsored research, development, or demonstration project;

    (3) Situations such as Work for Others Agreements, User Facility Agreements or CRADAs, involving DOE-approved private use of Government facilities where the waiver requestor is funding a substantial part of the costs; and

    (4) Situations in which the equities of the contractor are so substantial in relation to that of the Government that the waiver is necessary to obtain the participation of the contractor.

    (b) Waivers may be granted as to all or any part of the rights of the United States to an invention subject to certain rights retained by the United States as set forth in § 784.12 of this part. The scope of the waiver will depend upon the relationship of the contractual situation or identified invention to considerations set forth in §§ 784.4 or 784.5, and 784.6, if applicable, in order to best achieve the objectives set forth in § 784.3. For example, waivers may be restricted to a particular field of use in which the contractor has substantial equities or a commercial position, or restricted to those uses that are not the primary object of the contract effort. Waivers may also be made effective for a specified duration of time, may be limited to particular geographic locations, may require the contractor to license others at reduced royalties in consideration of the Government's contribution to the research, development, or demonstration effort, or may require return of a portion of the royalties or revenue to the Government.

    (c) Contractors shall not use their ability to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights for themselves in the subcontractor inventions, where the subcontractor(s) would prefer to petition for title. A waiver granted to a prime contractor is not normally applicable to inventions of subcontractors. However, in appropriate circumstances, the waiver given to the prime contractor may be made applicable to the waivable inventions of any or all subcontractors, such as where there are pre-existing special research and development arrangements between the prime contractor and subcontractor, or where the prime contractor and subcontractor are partners in a cooperative effort. In addition, in such circumstances, the prime contractor may be permitted to acquire nonexclusive licenses in the subcontractors' inventions when a waiver of the subcontractor inventions is not covered by the prime contractor's waiver.

    (d) In advance waivers of identified inventions, the invention will be deemed to be a subject invention and the waiver will be considered as being effective as of the effective date of the contract (see § 784.13(a)). This will be true regardless of whether the identified invention had been first actually reduced to practice prior to the time of contracting or would be reduced to practice under the contract or after expiration of the contract. One purpose of advance waivers of identified inventions is to establish the rights of the parties to such inventions when the facts surrounding the first actual reduction to practice prior to or during the contract are or will be difficult to establish.

    § 784.12   Terms and conditions of waivers.

#### § § 784.12

    The terms and conditions for waivers are set forth in the “Patent Rights—Waiver” clause in this section. A waiver of all foreign and domestic patent rights under a contract authorizes the use of this clause with any additions prescribed by the DOE Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Chapter 9) or the terms of the waiver. This clause shall not be used in contracts with small business firms or nonprofit organizations subject to 35 U.S.C. 200  If a waiver of different scope is granted, the clause shall be modified to conform to the scope of the waiver granted. Advance waivers for arrangements other than contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements may use other clause provisions approved by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property, except that all waivers for funding agreements shall be subject to the license of clause paragraph (b) and the provisions of clause paragraphs (i) and (j). The terms and conditions of the clause shall also constitute the basis for confirmatory licenses regarding waivers of identified inventions. For inventions under advance waivers, a duly executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all rights to which the Government is entitled is required to be submitted promptly after filing a patent application thereon. If, however, a waiver request is pending, delivery of the confirmatory instrument may be delayed until a determination on the waiver request is made. In the case of a waiver of an identified invention pursuant to a request for greater rights, the confirmatory instrument shall be agreed to or submitted to Patent Counsel before or at the time the waiver is granted.

    § 784.13   Effective dates.

#### § § 784.13

    Waivers shall be effective on the following dates:

    (a) For advance waivers of identified inventions, i.e., inventions conceived prior to the effective date of the contract, on the effective date of the contract, even though the advance waiver may have been requested after that date;

    (b) For identified inventions under advance waivers, i.e., inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice after the effective date of the contract, on the date the invention is reported with the election to retain rights as to that invention; and

    (c) For waivers of identified inventions (other than under an advance waiver), on the date of the letter from Patent Counsel notifying the requestor that the waiver has been granted.

Costs incurred by the borrower prior to the effective date of the loan agreement, and allowable under § 800.200, may be credited toward the borrower's share of costs if, in DOE's judgment, they were primarily related to the bid or proposal, but shall not be reimbursed from the loan.

      (7) The borrower shall make periodic reports regarding the bid or proposal.

      (8) The borrower shall maintain good standing under Federal, State and local laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of its business, including current payment of all taxes, fees and other charges and all requisite licenses and other governmental authorization necessary for the continued operation of the business throughout the term of the loan.

      (11) Such other provisions as the Secretary deems appropriate.

      (b) The loan agreement shall also provide for loan servicing and monitoring in accordance with § 800.300 and § 800.301, loan limitation in accordance with § 800.302, assignment and transfer in accordance with § 800.303, default in accordance with § 800.304 and appeals in accordance with § 800.307.

      (c) The Secretary may require, as preconditions to disbursement, that the borrower have specified amounts of working capital (including amounts derived from Federal financial assistance) and maintain specified financial ratios, where in the Secretary's judgment satisfaction of such preconditions is necessary to assure the borrower's ability to make and perform the contract, agreement or subcontract according to the bid or proposal, or is otherwise necessary to protect the interests of the United States.

      (d) The Secretary may require pledges, personal guarantees and other collateral security, and the maintenance of insurance on the borrower's assets and principals, in amounts and on terms appropriate in the Secretary's judgment, to protect the interests of the United States.

In determining the capability of a prospective servicing agent, DOE shall give due consideration to the experience of the agent in providing financial services to minority business enterprises.

      (b) If the servicing of the loan is by contract or other agreement, such contract or other agreement shall provide that the loan shall be serviced in accordance with this regulation and with the terms and conditions of the loan, under a standard of performance that a reasonable and prudent lender would require as to its own similar loan. Servicing responsibilities shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

      (1) Loan disbursements as set forth in the loan agreement.

The servicing agent, if any, shall make information regarding the loan available to the Secretary of Energy and Comptroller General to the extent lawful and within its ability. The Secretary may direct the applicant or borrower to submit to an audit by public accountant or equivalent acceptable to the Secretary.

      § 800.302   Loan limitation.

#### § § 800.302

      The Secretary may limit the loan by written notice to the borrower to those amounts, if any, already disbursed under the loan, if the Secretary has determined that the borower has failed to comply with a material term or condition set forth in the loan agreement.

      (b) No failure on the part of the Secretary to make demand at any time shall constitute a waiver of the rights held by the Secretary.

      (c) Upon demand by the Secretary, the borrower shall have a period of not more than 30 days from the date of receipt of the Secretary's demand to make payment in full.

      (d) In the event that the failure on the part of the borrower to perform the terms and conditions of the loan does not constitute an intentional act, but is brought about as a result of circumstances largely beyond the control of the borrower, or is deemed by, the Secretary to be insubstantial, the Secretary may elect, at the Secretary's option, to defer such performance and/or restructure the repayment required by the loan agreement in any mutually acceptable manner.

    § 810.9   Grant of specific authorization.

#### § § 810.9

    (a) An application for authorization to engage in activities for which specific authorization is required under § 810.7 should be made to the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, Washington, DC 20585, Attention: Senior Policy Advisor, Office of Nonproliferation and Arms Control (NPAC).

    (b) The Secretary will approve an application for specific authorization if it is determined, with the concurrence of the Department of State and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Commerce, and Department of Defense, that the activity will not be inimical to the interest of the United States. In making such a determination, the Secretary will take into account the following factors:

    (1) Whether the United States has an agreement for cooperation in force covering exports to the country or entity involved;

    (2) Whether the country is a party to, or has otherwise adhered to, the NPT;

    (3) Whether the country is in good standing with its acknowledged nonproliferation commitments;

    (4) Whether the country is in full compliance with its obligations under the NPT;

    (5) Whether the country has accepted IAEA safeguards obligations on all nuclear materials used for peaceful purposes and has them in force;

    (6) Whether other nonproliferation controls or conditions exist on the proposed activity, including that the recipient is duly authorized by the country to receive and use the technology sought to be transferred;

    (7) Significance of the assistance or transferred technology relative to the existing nuclear capabilities of the country;

    (8) Whether the transferred technology is part of an existing cooperative enrichment enterprise or the supply chain of such an enterprise;

    (9) The availability of comparable assistance or technology from other sources; and

    (10) Any other factors that may bear upon the political, economic, competitiveness, or security interests of the United States, including the obligations of the United States under treaties or other international agreements, and the obligations of the country under treaties or other international agreements.

    (c) If the proposed activity involves the export of sensitive nuclear technology, the requirements of sections 127 and 128 of the Atomic Energy Act and of any applicable United States international commitments must also be met. For the export of sensitive nuclear technology, in addition to the factors in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will take into account:

    (1) Whether the country has signed, ratified, and is implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA and has in force an Additional Protocol based on the Model Additional Protocol, or, pending this, in the case of a regional accounting and control arrangement for nuclear materials, is implementing, in cooperation with the IAEA, a safeguards agreement approved by the IAEA Board of Governors prior to the publication of INFCIRC/540 (September 1997); or alternatively whether comprehensive safeguards, including the measures of the Model Additional Protocol, are being applied in the country;

    (2) Whether the country has not been identified in a report by the IAEA Secretariat that is under consideration by the IAEA Board of Governors, as being in breach of obligations to comply with the applicable safeguards agreement, nor continues to be the subject of Board of Governors decisions calling upon it to take additional steps to comply with its safeguards obligations or to build confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, nor as to which the IAEA Secretariat has reported that it is unable to implement the applicable safeguards agreement. This criterion would not apply in cases where the IAEA Board of Governors or the United Nations Security Council subsequently decides that adequate assurances exist as to the peaceful purposes of the country's nuclear program and its compliance with the applicable safeguards agreements. For the purposes of this paragraph, “breach” refers only to serious breaches of proliferation concern;

    (3) Whether the country is adhering to the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines and, where applicable, has reported to the Security Council of the United Nations that it is implementing effective export controls as identified by Security Council Resolution 1540; and

    (4) Whether the country adheres to international safety conventions relating to nuclear or other radioactive materials or facilities.

    (d) Unless otherwise prohibited by U.S. law, the Secretary may grant an application for specific authorization for activities related to the enrichment of source material and special nuclear material, provided that:

    (1) The U.S. Government has received written nonproliferation assurances from the government of the country;

    (2) That it/they accept(s) the sensitive enrichment equipment and enabling technologies or an operable enrichment facility under conditions that do not permit or enable unauthorized replication of the facilities;

    (3) That the subject enrichment activity will not result in the production of uranium enriched to greater than 20% in the isotope uranium-235; and

    (4) That there are in place appropriate security arrangements to protect the activity from use or transfer inconsistent with the country's national laws.

    (e) Approximately 30 calendar days after the Secretary's grant of a specific authorization, a copy of the Secretary's determination may be provided to any person requesting it at DOE's Public Reading Room, unless the applicant submits information demonstrating that public disclosure will cause substantial harm to its competitive position. This provision does not affect any other authority provided by law for the non-disclosure of information.

    § 810.10   Revocation, suspension, or modification of authorization.

#### § § 810.10

    The Secretary may revoke, suspend, or modify a general or specific authorization:

    (a) For any material false statement in an application for specific authorization or in any additional information submitted in its support;

    (b) For failing to provide a report or for any material false statement in a report submitted pursuant to § 810.12;

    (c) If any authorization governed by this part is subsequently determined by the Secretary to be inimical to the interest of the United States or otherwise no longer meets the legal criteria for approval; or

    § 810.15   Violations.

#### § § 810.15

    (a) The Atomic Energy Act provides that:

    (1) In accordance with section 232 of the AEA, permanent or temporary injunctions, restraining or other orders may be granted to prevent a violation of any provision of the Atomic Energy Act or any regulation or order issued thereunder.

    (2) In accordance with section 222 of the AEA, whoever willfully violates, attempts to violate, or conspires to violate any provision of section 57 of the Atomic Energy Act may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned up to 10 years, or both. If the offense is committed with intent to injure the United States or to aid any foreign nation, the penalty could be up to life imprisonment or a $20,000 fine, or both.

    (b) In accordance with Title 18 of the United States Code, section 1001, whoever knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes or uses false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations shall be fined under that title or imprisoned up to five or eight years depending on the crime, or both.

    (c) In accordance with section 234 of the AEA, any person who violates any provision of section 57 b. of the AEA, as implemented under this part, shall be subject to a civil penalty, not to exceed $127,973 per violation, such amount to be adjusted annually for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. If any violation is a continuing one, each day from the point at which the violating activity began to the point at which the violating activity was suspended shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of computing the applicable civil penalty. The mere act of suspending an activity does not constitute admission that the activity was a violation and does not waive the rights and processes outlined in paragraphs (c)(4) through (14) of this section or otherwise impact the right of the person to appeal any civil penalty that may be imposed.

    (1) In order to begin a proceeding to impose a civil penalty under this paragraph (c), the Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation or his/her designee, shall notify the person by a written notice of violation sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address of such person, of:

    (i) The date, facts, and nature of each act or omission with which the person is charged;

    (ii) The particular provision or provisions of section 57 b. of the AEA, as implemented under this part, involved in each alleged violation;

    (iii) The penalty which DOE proposes to impose, including an explanation of how the factors at paragraph (c)(5) of this section were considered;

    (iv) The opportunity of the person to submit a written reply within 30 calendar days of receipt of such preliminary notice of violation showing why such penalty should not be imposed; and

    (v) The possibility of collection by civil action upon failure to pay the civil penalty.

    (2) A reply to the notice of violation must:

    (i) State any facts, explanations, and arguments which support a denial of the alleged violation;

    (ii) Demonstrate any extenuating circumstances or other reason why a proposed penalty should not be imposed or should be mitigated;

    (iii) Discuss the relevant authorities which support the position asserted;

    (iv) Furnish full and complete answers to any questions set forth in the notice of violation; and

    (v) Include copies of all relevant documents.

    (3) If a person fails to submit a written reply within 30 calendar days of receipt of a notice of violation, the notice of violation, including any penalties therein, constitutes a final decision, and payment of the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation is due 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of violation. Such failure to submit a reply constitutes a waiver of the rights and processes outlined in paragraphs (c)(4) through (14) of this section.

    (4) The Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation or his/her designee, at the written request of a person notified of an alleged violation, may extend in writing, for a reasonable period, the time for submitting a reply.

    (5) If a person submits a timely written reply to the notice of violation, the Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation will make a final determination whether the person violated or is continuing to violate a requirement of section 57 b. of the AEA, as implemented under this part. Based on a determination that a person has violated or is continuing to violate a requirement of section 57 b., as implemented under this part, the Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation will issue to that person a final notice of violation that concisely states the violation, the amount of the civil penalty imposed, including an explanation of how the factors in this paragraph were considered, further actions necessary by or available to the person, and that upon failure to timely pay the civil penalty, the penalty may be collected by civil action. The Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation will send such a final notice of violation by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the person. The amount of the civil penalty will be based on:

    (i) The nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations;

    (ii) The violator's ability to pay;

    (iii) The effect of the civil penalty on the person's ability to do business;

    (iv) Any history of prior violations;

    (v) The degree of culpability;

    (vi) Whether the violator self-disclosed the violation;

    (vii) The economic significance of the violation; and (viii) Such other factors as justice may require.

    (6) Any person who receives a final notice of violation under paragraph (c)(5) of this section may request a hearing concerning the allegations contained in the notice. The person must mail or deliver any written request for a hearing to the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security within 30 calendar days of receipt of the final notice of violation. If the person does not request a hearing within 30 calendar days, the final notice of violation, including any penalties therein, constitutes a final decision, and payment of the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the final notice of violation is due 45 calendar days after receipt of the final notice of violation.

    (7) Upon receipt from a person of a written request for a hearing, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security or his/her designee, shall:

    (i) Appoint a Hearing Counsel; and

    (ii) Forward the request to the DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). The OHA Director shall appoint an OHA Administrative Judge to preside at the hearing.

    (8) The Hearing Counsel shall be an attorney employed by DOE, and shall have all powers necessary to represent DOE before the OHA.

    (9) In all hearings under this paragraph (c):

    (i) The parties have the right to be represented by a person of their choosing, subject to possessing an appropriate information access authorization for the subject matter. The parties are responsible for producing witnesses on their behalf, including requesting the issuance of subpoenas, if necessary;

    (ii) Testimony of witnesses is given under oath or affirmation, and witnesses must be advised of the applicability of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 18 U.S.C. 1621, dealing with the criminal penalties associated with false statements and perjury;

    (iii) Witnesses are subject to cross-examination;

    (iv) Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but OHA may use the Federal Rules of Evidence as a guide; and

    (v) A court reporter will make a transcript of the hearing.

    (vi) The Administrative Judge has all powers necessary to regulate the conduct of proceedings:

    (vii) The Administrative Judge may order discovery at the request of a party, based on a showing that the requested discovery is designed to produce evidence regarding a matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter of the complaint;

    (viii) The Administrative Judge may permit parties to obtain discovery by any appropriate method, including deposition upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things; permission to enter upon land or other property for inspection and other purposes; and requests for admission;

    (ix) The Administrative Judge may issue subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses on behalf of either party, or for the production of specific documents or other physical evidence;

    (x) The Administrative Judge may rule on objections to the presentation of evidence; exclude evidence that is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious; require the advance submission of documents offered as evidence; dispose of procedural requests; grant extensions of time; determine the format of the hearing; direct that written motions, documents, or briefs be filed with respect to issues raised during the course of the hearing; ask questions of witnesses; direct that documentary evidence be served upon other parties (under protective order if such evidence is deemed confidential); and otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing;

    (xi) The Administrative Judge may, at the request of a party or on his or her own initiative, dismiss a claim, defense, or party and make adverse findings upon the failure of a party or the party's representative to comply with a lawful order of the Administrative Judge, or, without good cause, to attend a hearing;

    (xii) The Administrative Judge, upon request of a party, may allow the parties a reasonable time to file pre-hearing briefs or written statements with respect to material issues of fact or law. Any pre-hearing submission must be limited to the issues specified and filed within the time prescribed by the Administrative Judge;

    (xiii) The parties are entitled to make oral closing arguments, but post-hearing submissions are only permitted by direction of the Administrative Judge;

    (xiv) Parties allowed to file written submissions, or documentary evidence must serve copies upon the other parties within the timeframe prescribed by the Administrative Judge;

    (xv) The Administrative Judge is prohibited, beginning with his or her appointment and until a final agency decision is issued, from initiating or otherwise engaging in  (private) discussions with any party on the merits of the complaint;

    (xvi) The Administrative Judge is responsible for determining the date, time, and location of the hearing, including whether the hearing will be conducted via video conference; and

    (xvii) The Administrative Judge shall convene the hearing within 180 days of the OHA's receipt of the request for a hearing, unless the parties agree to an extension of this deadline by mutual written consent, or the Administrative Judge determines that extraordinary circumstances exist that require a delay.

    (10) Hearings shall be open only to Hearing Counsel, duly authorized representatives of DOE, the person and the person's counsel or other representatives, and such other persons as may be authorized by the Administrative Judge. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Judge, witnesses shall testify in the presence of the person but not in the presence of other witnesses.

    (11) The Administrative Judge must use procedures appropriate to safeguard and prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any other information protected from public disclosure by law or regulation, with minimum impairment of rights and obligations under this part. The classified or otherwise protected status of any information shall not, however, preclude its being introduced into evidence. The Administrative Judge may issue such orders as may be necessary to consider such evidence in camera including the preparation of a supplemental recommended decision to address issues of law or fact that arise out of that portion of the evidence that is classified or otherwise protected.

    (12) DOE shall have the burden of proving the violation(s) as set forth in the final notice of violation by a preponderance of the evidence. The person to whom the notice of violation is addressed shall have the burden of proving any affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The amount of the penalty associated with any violation which is upheld shall be adopted by the Administrative Judge unless not supported by the facts, in which event the Administrative Judge will include such information in the Administrative Judge's recommended decisions to the Under Secretary for reconsideration of the amount of the penalty based on the Administrate Judge's resolution of the factual issues.

    (13) Within 180 days of receiving a copy of the hearing transcript, or the closing of the record, whichever is later, the Administrative Judge shall issue a recommended decision. The recommended decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions regarding all material issues of law, as well as the reasons therefor. If the Administrative Judge determines that a violation has occurred and that a civil penalty is appropriate, the recommended decision shall set forth the amount of the civil penalty based on the factors in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

    (14) The Administrative Judge shall forward the recommended decision to the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Security shall make a final decision as soon as practicable after completing his/her review. This may include compromising, mitigating, or remitting the penalties in accordance with section 234 a. of the AEA, as amended. DOE shall notify the person of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security's final decision or other action under this paragraph in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested. The person against whom the civil penalty is assessed by the final decision shall pay the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the final decision within 30 calendar days unless otherwise determined by the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security.

    (15) If a civil penalty assessed in a final decision is not paid as provided in paragraphs(c)(3), (6), or (14) of this section, as appropriate, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security may request the Department of Justice to initiate a civil action to collect the penalty imposed under this paragraph in accordance with section 234 c. of the AEA.

      (c)  Where a pleading or document is served by mail, five (5) days shall be added to the time allowed by these rules for the filing of a responsive pleading or document. Where a pleading or document is served by express mail, only two (2) days shall be added.

      § 820.7   Questions of policy or law.

#### § § 820.7

      (a)  There shall be no interlocutory appeal from any ruling order, or action decision of a DOE Official except as permitted by this section. A Presiding Officer in an enforcement adjudication may certify, in his discretion, a question to the Secretary, when the order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial grounds for difference of opinion, and either an immediate decision will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding, or subsequent review will be inadequate or ineffective.

      (b)  The certified question shall be decided as soon as practicable. If the Secretary determines that the question was improvidently certified, or if he takes no action within thirty days of the certification, the certification is dismissed. The Secretary may decide the question on the basis of the submission made by the Presiding Officer or may request further information from any person.

      § 820.8   Evidentiary matters.

#### § § 820.8

      (a)  A DOE Official may obtain information or evidence for the full and complete investigation of any matter related to a DOE nuclear activity or for any decision required by this part. A DOE Official may sign, issue and serve subpoenas; administer oaths and affirmations; take sworn testimony; compel attendance of and sequester witnesses; control dissemination of any record of testimony taken pursuant to this section; subpoena and reproduce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other relevant records or tangible evidence including, but not limited to, information retained in computerized or other automated systems in possession of the subpoenaed person.

      (b)  A DOE Official may issue a Special Report Order (SRO) requiring any person involved in a DOE nuclear activity or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of DOE to file a special report providing information relating to a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement, the Act, or a Nuclear Statute, including but not limited to written answers to specific questions. The SRO may be in addition to any other reports required by this part.

      (c)  The DOE Official who issues a subpoena or SRO pursuant to this section, for good cause shown, may extend the time prescribed for compliance with the subpoena or SRO and negotiate and approve the terms of satisfactory compliance.

      (d)  Prior to the time specified for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days after the date of service of the subpoena or SRO, the person upon whom the document was served may request reconsideration of the subpoena or SRO with the DOE Official who issued the document. If the subpoena or SRO is not modified or rescinded within 10 days of the date of the filing of the request, the subpoena or SRO shall be effective as issued and the person upon whom the document was served shall comply with the subpoena or SRO within 20 days of the date of the filing. There is no administrative appeal of a subpoena or SRO.

      (e)  A subpoena or SRO shall be served in the manner set forth in § 820.5, except that service by mail must be made by registered or certified mail.

      (f)  (1) A witness subpoenaed by a DOE Official shall be paid the same fees and mileage as paid to a witness in the district courts of the United States.

      (2) If a subpoena is issued at the request of a person other than an officer or agency of the United States, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person who requested the subpoena. However, at the request of the person, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the DOE if the person shows:

      (i) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance the proceeding; and

      (ii) The person who requested that the subpoena be issued would suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and mileage. The DOE Official issuing the subpoena shall make the determination required by this subsection.

      (g)  If any person upon whom a subpoena or SRO is served pursuant to this section, refuses or fails to comply with any provision of the subpoena or SRO, an action may be commenced in the United States District Court to enforce the subpoena or SRO.

      (h)  (1) Documents produced in response to a subpoena shall be accompanied by the sworn certification, under penalty of perjury, of the person to whom the subpoena was directed or his authorized agent that a diligent search has been made for each document responsive to the subpoena, and to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief all such documents responsive to the subpoena are being produced unless withheld on the grounds of privilege pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section.

      (2) Any information furnished in response to an SRO shall be accompanied by the sworn certification under penalty of perjury of the person to whom it was directed or his authorized agent who actually provides the information that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief a diligent effort has been made to provide all information required by the SRO, and all information furnished is true, complete, and correct unless withheld on grounds of privilege pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section.

      (3) If any document responsive to a subpoena is not produced or any information required by an SRO is not furnished, the certification shall include a statement setting forth every reason for failing to comply with the subpoena or SRO.

      (i)  If a person to whom a subpoena or SRO is directed withholds any document or information because of a claim of attorney-client or other privilege, the person submitting the certification required by paragraph (h) of this section also shall submit a written list of the documents or the information withheld indicating a description of each document or information, the date of the document, each person shown on the document as having received a copy of the document, each person shown on the document as having prepared or been sent the document, the privilege relied upon as the basis for withholding the document or information, a memorandum of law supporting the claim of privilege, and an identification of the person whose privilege is being asserted.

      (j)  (1) If a person's statement/testimony is taken pursuant to a subpoena, the DOE Official shall determine whether the statement/testimony shall be recorded and the means by which it is recorded.

      (2) A person whose statement/testimony is recorded may procure a copy of the transcript by making a written request for a copy and paying the appropriate fees. Upon proper identification, any potential witness or his attorney has the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness' own statement or testimony.

      (k)  The DOE Official may sequester any person who furnishes documents or gives testimony. Unless permitted by the DOE Official, neither a witness nor his attorney shall be present during the examination of any other witnesses.

      (l)  (1) Any person whose statement or testimony is taken may be accompanied, represented and advised by his attorney; provided that, if the witness claims a privilege to refuse to answer a question on the grounds of self-incrimination, the witness must assert the privilege personally.

      (2) The DOE Official shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of testimony and to avoid delay and prevent or restrain contemptuous or obstructionist conduct or contemptuous language. The DOE Official may take actions as the circumstances may warrant in regard to any instances where any attorney refuses to comply with directions or provisions of this section.

      § 820.9   Special assistant.

#### § § 820.9

      A DOE Official may appoint a person to serve as a special assistant to assist the DOE Official in the conduct of any proceeding under this part. Such appointment may occur at any appropriate time. A special assistant shall be subject to the disqualification provisions in § 820.5. A special assistant may perform those duties assigned by the DOE Official, including but not limited to, serving as technical interrogators, technical advisors and special master.

      § 820.10   Office of the docketing clerk.

#### § § 820.10

      (a)  The Docketing Clerk shall maintain a docket for enforcement actions commencing with the issuance of a Preliminary Notice of Violation, interpretations issued pursuant to subpart D of this part, exemptions issued pursuant to subpart E of this part, and any other matters designated by the Secretary. A docket for an enforcement action shall contain all documents required to be filed in the proceeding.

      (b)  Subject to the provisions of law restricting the public disclosure of certain information, any person may, during Department business hours, inspect and copy any document filed with the Docketing Clerk. The cost of duplicating documents shall be borne by the person seeking copies of such documents. The DOE Official may waive this cost in appropriate cases.

      (c)  Except as otherwise provided in this part, after the filing of a Preliminary Notice of Violation, all hearings, conferences, and other meetings in the enforcement process shall be transcribed verbatim. A copy of the transcript shall be filed with the Docketing Clerk promptly. The Docketing Clerk shall serve all participants with notice of the availability of the transcript and shall furnish the participants with a copy of the transcript upon payment of the cost of reproduction, unless a participant can show that the cost is unduly burdensome.

      § 820.11   Information requirements.

#### § § 820.11

      (a) Any information pertaining to a nuclear activity provided to DOE by any person or maintained by any person for inspection by DOE shall be complete and accurate in all material respects.

      (b) No person involved in a DOE nuclear activity shall conceal or destroy any information concerning a violation of a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement, a Nuclear Statute, or the Act.

      § 820.12   Classified, confidential, and controlled information

#### § § 820.12

      (a)  The DOE Official in charge of a proceeding under this part may utilize any procedures deemed appropriate to safeguard and prevent disclosure of classified, confidential, and controlled information, including Restricted Data and National Security Information, to unauthorized persons, with minimum impairment of rights and obligations under this part.

      (b)  Nothing in this part shall relieve any person from safeguarding classified, confidential, and controlled information, including Restricted Data or National Security Information, in accordance with the applicable provisions of federal statutes and the rules, regulations, and orders of any federal agency.

      § 820.13   Direction to NNSA contractors.

#### § § 820.13

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, and pursuant to section 3213 of Pub. L. 106-65, as amended (codified at 50 U.S.C. 2403), the NNSA, rather than the Director, signs, issues and serves the following actions that direct NNSA contractors:

      (1) Subpoenas;

      (2) Orders to compel attendance;

      (3) Disclosures of information or documents obtained during an investigation or inspection;

      (4) Preliminary notices of violations; and

      (5) Final notices of violations.

      (b) The NNSA Administrator shall act after consideration of the Director's recommendation.

      § 820.14   Whistleblower protection.

#### § § 820.14

      (a)  An act of retaliation (as defined in 10 CFR 708.2) by a DOE contractor, prohibited by 10 CFR 708.43, that results from a DOE contractor employee's involvement in an activity listed in 10 CFR 708.5(a) through (c) may constitute a violation of a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement if it concerns nuclear safety.

      (b)  The Director may not initiate an investigation or take any other action under this part with respect to an alleged act of retaliation by a DOE contractor until 180 days after an alleged violation of 10 CFR 708.43 occurs.

      (c)  The Director shall immediately suspend any ongoing activities under this part and suspend any time limits under this part when an administrative or judicial proceeding commences based on the same alleged act of retaliation. While an administrative or judicial proceeding, including appeals, is pending, the Director may not exercise any authority under this part based on an alleged violation of 10 CFR 708.43, including issuing enforcement letters, subpoenas, orders to compel attendance, Consent Orders, Preliminary Notices of Violation, or Final Notices of Violation. Once such a proceeding commences, the Director shall not conduct any activities under this part until sixty days after a final decision of an agency or court finds that a retaliation occurred, or otherwise makes a final disposition of the matter on procedural grounds without explicitly finding that retaliation did not occur.

      (d)  For the purposes of this section, a final decision of an agency or court includes any of the following:

      (1) A final agency decision pursuant to 10 CFR part 708;

      (2) A final decision or order of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 29 CFR part 24;

      (3) A decision by the Secretary upon a report by the Inspector General;

      (4) A decision by a federal or state court.

      (e)  If a final decision of an agency or court finds that retaliation occurred, the Director may obtain and use information collected as part of those proceedings. The Director has discretion to give appropriate weight to information obtained from these proceedings and to initiate and conduct further investigation if the Director deems necessary, particularly with regard to the relationship between the retaliation and nuclear safety.

      (f)  Notwithstanding the commencement of an administrative or judicial proceeding based on an alleged act of retaliation, this section shall not prevent the Director from taking any action consistent with this part regarding compliance with DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements other than 10 CFR 708.43.

    Subpart B—Enforcement Process

      § 820.20   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 820.20

      (a)  This subpart establishes the procedures for investigating the nature and extent of violations of DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements, for determining whether a violation of DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements has occurred, for imposing an appropriate remedy, and for adjudicating the assessment of a civil penalty.

      (b)  DOE may assess civil penalties against any person subject to the provisions of this part who has entered into an agreement of indemnification under 42 U.S.C. 2210(d) (or any subcontractor or supplier thereto), unless exempted from civil penalties as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, on the basis of a violation of a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement.

      (c)  With respect to a violation occurring under a contract entered into before August 8, 2005, the following contractors, and subcontractors and suppliers to that prime contract only, are exempt from the assessment of civil penalties under this subpart with respect to the activities specified below:

      (1) The University of Chicago for activities associated with Argonne National Laboratory;

      (2) The University of California for activities associated with Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;

      (3) American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its subsidiaries for activities associated with Sandia National Laboratories;

      (4) University Research Association, Inc. for activities associated with FERMI National Laboratory;

      (5) Princeton University for activities associated with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory;

      (6) The Associated Universities, Inc. for activities associated with the Brookhaven National Laboratory; and

      (7) Battelle Memorial Institute for activities associated with Pacific Northwest Laboratory.

      (d)  With respect to a violation occurring under a contract entered into before August 8, 2005, any educational institution that is considered nonprofit under the United States Internal Revenue Code shall receive automatic remission of any civil penalty assessed under this part.

      (e)  With respect to any violation occurring under a contract entered into on or after August 8, 2005, in the case of any not-for-profit contractor, subcontractor, or supplier, the total amount of civil penalties paid under this part may not exceed the total amount of fees paid by DOE to that entity within the U.S. Government fiscal year in which the violation occurs.

      (f)  For purposes of this part, a “not-for-profit” contractor, subcontractor, or supplier is one for which no part of the net earnings of the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier inures to the benefit of any natural person or for-profit artificial person.

      § 820.21   Investigations.

#### § § 820.21

      (a) The Director may initiate and conduct investigations and inspections relating to the scope, nature and extent of compliance by a person with the Act and the DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements and take such action as he deems necessary and appropriate to the conduct of the investigation or inspection, including any action pursuant to § 820.8.

      (b) Any person may request the Director to initiate an investigation or inspection pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. A request for an investigation or inspection shall set forth the subject matter or activity to be investigated or inspected as fully as possible and include supporting documentation and information. No particular forms or procedures are required.

      (c) Any person who is requested to furnish documentary evidence, information or testimony in an investigation or during an inspection shall be informed, upon written request, of the general purpose of the investigation or inspection.

      (d) Information or documents that are obtained during any investigation or inspection shall not be disclosed unless the Director directs or authorizes the public disclosure of the investigation. Upon such authorization, the information or documents are a matter of public record and disclosure is not precluded by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 and 10 CFR part 1004. A request for confidential treatment of information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act shall not prevent disclosure by the Director if disclosure is determined to be in the public interest and otherwise permitted or required by law.

      (e) During the course of an investigation or inspection any person may submit at any time any document, statement of facts or memorandum of law for the purpose of explaining the person's position or furnish information which the person considers relevant to a matter or activity under investigation or inspection.

      (f) If facts disclosed by an investigation or inspection indicate that further action is unnecessary or unwarranted, the investigation may be closed without prejudice to further investigation or inspection by the Director at any time that circumstances so warrant.

      (g) The Director may issue enforcement letters that communicate DOE's expectations with respect to any aspect of the requirements of DOE's Nuclear Safety Requirements, including identification and reporting of issues, corrective actions, and implementation of DOE's Nuclear Safety Requirements, provided that an enforcement letter may not create the basis for any legally enforceable requirement pursuant to this part.

      (h) The Director may sign, issue and serve subpoenas.

      § 820.22   Informal conference.

#### § § 820.22

      The Director may convene an informal conference to discuss any situation that might be a violation of the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement, its significance and cause, any correction taken or not taken by the person, any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and any other useful information. The Director may compel a person to attend the conference. This conference will not normally be open to the public and there shall be no transcript.

      § 820.23   Consent order.

#### § § 820.23

      (a)  DOE encourages settlement of an enforcement proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the objectives of the Act and the DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements. The Director and a person may confer at any time concerning settlement. These settlement conferences shall not be open to the public and there shall be no transcript.

      (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, DOE may at any time resolve any or all issues in an outstanding enforcement proceeding with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be signed by the Director and the person who is its subject, or a duly authorized representative, must indicate agreement to the terms contained therein and must be filed. A Consent Order need not constitute an admission by any person that the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement has been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the DOE that such person has violated the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement. A Consent Order shall, however, set forth the relevant facts which form the basis for the Order and what remedy, if any, is imposed.

      (c)  If a Consent Order is signed after the commencement of an enforcement adjudication, the adjudication of the issues subject to the Consent Order shall be stayed until the completion of the Secretarial Review Process. If the Consent Order becomes a Final Order, the adjudication shall be terminated or modified as specified in the Order.

      (d)  A Consent Order shall become a Final Order 30 days after it is filed unless the Secretary files a rejection of the Consent Order or a Modified Consent Order. A Modified Consent Order shall become a Final Order if the Director and the person who is its subject sign it within 15 days of its filing.

      § 820.24   Preliminary notice of violation.

#### § § 820.24

      (a) If the Director has reason to believe a person has violated or is continuing to violate a provision of the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement, he may file a Preliminary Notice of Violation. The Notice and any transmittal documents shall contain sufficient information to fairly apprise the respondent of the facts and circumstances of the alleged violations and the basis of any proposed remedy, and to properly indicate what further actions are necessary by or available to respondent.

      (b) Within 30 days after the filing of a Preliminary Notice of Violation, the respondent shall file a reply.

      (c) The reply shall be in writing and signed by the person filing it. The reply shall contain a statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the situation that is the subject of the Notice. The reply shall state any facts, explanations and arguments which support a denial that a violation has occurred as alleged; demonstrate any extenuating circumstances or other reason why the proposed remedy should not be imposed or should be mitigated; and furnish full and complete answers to the questions set forth in the Notice. Copies of all relevant documents shall be submitted with the reply. The reply shall include a discussion of the relevant authorities which support the position asserted, including rulings, regulations, interpretations, and previous decisions issued by DOE.

      (d) The respondent may terminate an enforcement action if the reply agrees to comply with the proposed remedy and waives any right to contest the Notice or the remedy. If a respondent elects this option, the Preliminary Notice of Violation shall be deemed a Final Order upon the filing of the reply.

      § 820.25   Final notice of violation.

#### § § 820.25

      (a)  If, after reviewing the reply submitted by the respondent, the Director determines that a person violated or is continuing to violate a provision of the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety Requirement, he may file a Final Notice of Violation. The Final Notice shall concisely state the determined violation, any designated penalty, and further actions necessary by or available to respondent.

      (b)  (1) If a Final Notice of Violation does not contain a civil penalty, it shall be deemed filed as a Final Order 15 days after the Final Notice is filed unless the Secretary files a Final Order which modifies the Final Notice.

      (2) If a Final Notice of Violation contains a civil penalty, the respondent must file within 30 days after the filing of the Final Notice:

      (i) A waiver of further proceedings;

      (ii) A request for an on-the-record adjudication; or

      (iii) A notice of intent to seek judicial review.

      (c)  If a respondent waives further proceedings, the Final Notice of Violation shall be deemed a Final Order enforceable against the respondent. The respondent must pay any civil penalty set forth in the Notice of Violation within 60 days of the filing of waiver unless the Director grants additional time.

      (d)  If a respondent files a request for an on-the-record adjudication, then an enforcement adjudication commences.

      (e)  If a respondent files a Notice of Intent, the Final Notice of Violation shall be deemed a Final Order enforceable against the respondent.

      (f)  The Director may amend the Final Notice of Violation at any time before an action takes place pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. An amendment shall add fifteen days to the time periods under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (g)  The Director may withdraw the Final Notice of Violation, or any part thereof, at any time before an action under paragraph (b) of this section.

      § 820.26   Enforcement adjudication.

#### § § 820.26

      If a respondent files a request for an on-the-record adjudication, an enforcement adjudication is initiated and the Docketing Clerk shall notify the Secretary who shall appoint an Administrative Law Judge to be the Presiding Officer.

      § 820.27   Answer.

#### § § 820.27

      (a)  If a respondent files a request for an on-the-record adjudication pursuant to § 820.25, a written answer to the Final Notice of Violation shall be filed at the same time the request is filed.

      (b)  The answer shall clearly and directly admit, deny or explain each of the factual allegations contained in the Final Notice of Violation with regard to which respondent has any knowledge, information or belief. Where respondent has no knowledge, information or belief of a particular factual allegation and so states, the allegation is deemed denied. The answer shall also state the circumstance or argument that is alleged to constitute the grounds of defense and the facts that respondent intends to place at issue.

      (c)  Failure of respondent to admit, deny, or explain any material factual allegation contained in the Final Notice of Violation constitutes an admission of the allegation.

      (d)  The respondent may amend the answer to the Final Notice of Violation upon motion granted by the Presiding Officer.

      § 820.28   Prehearing actions.

#### § § 820.28

      (a)  The Presiding Officer shall establish a schedule for the adjudication and take such other actions as he determines appropriate to conduct the adjudication in a fair and expeditious manner.

      (b)  The Presiding Officer, at any time before a hearing begins, may direct the parties and their counsel, or other representatives, to appear at a conference before him to consider, as appropriate:

      (1) The settlement of the case;

      (2) The simplification of issues and stipulation of facts not in dispute;

      (3) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;

      (4) The exchange of exhibits;

      (5) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;

      (6) Setting a time and place for the hearing; and

      (7) Any other matters that may expedite the disposition of the proceeding.

      (c)  Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, at least five (5) days before any prehearing conference, each party shall make available to all other parties, as appropriate, the names of the expert and other witnesses it intends to call, together with a brief narrative summary of their expected testimony, and copies of all documents and exhibits that each party intends to introduce into evidence. Documents and exhibits shall be marked for identification as ordered by the Presiding Officer. Documents that have not been exchanged and witnesses whose names have not been exchanged shall not be introduced into evidence or allowed to testify without permission of the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties reasonable opportunity to review new evidence.

      (d)  The Presiding Officer shall prepare an order incorporating any action taken at the conference. The summary shall incorporate any written stipulations or agreements of the parties and all rulings and appropriate orders containing directions to the parties.

      (e)  If a prehearing conference is unnecessary or impracticable, the Presiding Officer, on motion or  may direct the parties to make appropriate filings with him to accomplish any of the objectives set forth in this section.

      (f)  (1) Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, further discovery under this section shall be permitted only upon determination by the Presiding Officer:

      (i) That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the proceeding;

      (ii) That the information to be obtained is not otherwise obtainable; and

      (iii) That such information has significant probative value.

      (2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:

      (i) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods; or

      (ii) There is substantial reason to believe that relevant and probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a witness at the hearing.

      (3) Any party to the proceeding desiring an order to take further discovery shall make a motion therefor. Such a motion shall set forth:

      (i) The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;

      (ii) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and

      (iii) The proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted, he shall issue an order for the taking of such discovery together with the conditions and terms thereof.

      (4) When the information sought to be obtained is within the control of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be discovered would be adverse to the party from whom the information was sought, or the issuance of a default order under 820.38.

      § 820.29   Hearing.

#### § § 820.29

      (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this part or the Presiding Officer, a hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence. The Presiding Officer shall have the discretion to admit all evidence that is not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable or of little probative value, if he believes the evidence might facilitate the fair and expeditious resolution of the proceeding. But such evidence may be reasonably limited by the Presiding Officer in scope and length in order to permit prompt resolution of the proceeding. In the presentation, admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the Presiding Officer shall preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets and other commercial and financial information, and shall protect classified and unclassified controlled nuclear information, as well as any other information protected from public disclosure pursuant to law or regulation. The confidential, trade secret, or classified or otherwise protected status of any information shall not, however, preclude its being introduced into evidence. The Presiding Officer may make such orders as may be necessary to consider such evidence in camera, including the preparation of a supplemental initial decision to address questions of law, fact, or discretion that arise out of that portion of the evidence that is confidential, includes trade secrets, is classified, or is otherwise protected.

      (b)  The attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary evidence may be required by subpoena.

      (c)  There shall be no direct oral testimony by witnesses, except as permitted by the Presiding Officer. In lieu of oral testimony, the Presiding Officer shall admit into the record as evidence verified written statements of fact or opinion prepared by a witness. The admissibility of the evidence contained in the statement shall be subject to the same rules as if the testimony were produced under oral examination. Before any such statement is read or admitted into evidence, the witness shall have delivered a copy of the statement to the Presiding Officer and the opposing counsel not less than 10 days prior to the date the witness is scheduled to testify. The witness presenting the statement shall swear or affirm that the statement is true and accurate to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief and shall be subject to appropriate oral cross-examination upon the contents thereof provided such cross-examination is not unduly repetitious.

      (d)  The Director has the burden of going forward with and of proving that the violation occurred as set forth in the Notice of Violation and that the proposed civil penalty is appropriate. Following the establishment of a  case, respondent shall have the burden of presenting and of going forward with any defense to the allegations set forth in the Notice of Violation. Each matter of controversy shall be determined by the Presiding Officer upon a preponderance of the evidence.

Reply briefs may be filed within ten days of the filing of briefs. All filings shall be in writing, shall be served upon all parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record and authorities relied on.

      § 820.31   Initial decision.

#### § § 820.31

      (a)  The Presiding Officer shall file an Initial Decision as soon as practicable after the period for filing reply briefs under 820.30 has expired. The Initial Decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions regarding all material issues of law or discretion, as well as reasons therefor, any remedy and a proposed Final Order. A party may file comments on an Initial Decision within fifteen days of its filing.

      (b)  If the Presiding Officer determines that a violation has occurred and that a civil penalty is appropriate, the Initial Decision shall set forth the dollar amount of the civil penalty. If the Presiding Officer decides to assess a penalty different in amount from the penalty assessed in the Final Notice of Violation, the Initial Decision shall set forth the specific reasons for the increase or decrease.

      § 820.32   Final order.

#### § § 820.32

      (a)  The Initial Decision shall be deemed filed as a Final Order thirty days after the filing of the Initial Decision unless the Secretary files a Final Order that modifies the Initial Decision or the Secretary files a Notice of Review.

      (b)  If the Secretary files a Notice of Review, he shall file a Final Order as soon as practicable after completing his review.

The alleged defaulting party shall have ten days to answer the motion or the Notice of Intent. No finding of default shall be made against the respondent unless the Director presents sufficient evidence to the Presiding Officer to establish a  case against the respondent. Default by respondent constitutes, for purposes of the pending action only, an admission of all facts alleged in the Final Notice of Violation and a waiver of respondent's rights to an on-the-record adjudication of such factual allegations. Default by the Director shall result in an order to dismiss the Final Notice of Violation with prejudice.

      (b)  When the Presiding Officer finds a default has occurred, he shall file a Default Order against the defaulting party. This order shall constitute an Initial Decision.

      (c)  A Default Order shall include findings of fact showing the grounds for the order, conclusions regarding all material issues of fact, law or discretion, and the remedy.

In addition, the Presiding Officer, upon motion of the respondent, may render at any time an Accelerated Decision to dismiss an action without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence as he requires, on the basis of failure to establish a  case or other grounds that show no right to relief on the part of the Director.

      (b)  (1) If an Accelerated Decision is rendered as to all the issues and claims in the adjudication, the decision constitutes an Initial Decision of the Presiding Officer, and shall be filed with the Docketing Clerk.

      (2) If an Accelerated Decision is rendered on less than all issues or claims in the adjudication, the Presiding Officer shall determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts remain controverted in good faith. He shall thereupon file an interlocutory order specifying the facts that appear substantially uncontroverted, and the issues and claims upon which the adjudication will proceed.

      § 820.35    discussions.

#### § § 820.35

      At no time after a respondent has requested an on-the-record adjudication of the assessment of a civil penalty shall a DOE Official, or any person who is likely to advise a DOE Official in the decision on the case, discuss  the merits of the proceeding with any interested person outside DOE, with any DOE staff member who performs a prosecutorial or investigative function in such proceeding or a factually related proceeding, or with any representative of such person. Any  memorandum or other communication addressed to a DOE Official during the pendency of the proceeding and relating to the merits thereof, by or on behalf of any party shall be regarded as argument made in the proceeding and shall be served upon all other parties.

      (4) The initial document filed by any person shall contain his name, address and telephone number. Any changes in this information shall be communicated promptly to the Docketing Clerk and all participants to the proceeding.

      means any area, accessible to individuals, where:

      (1) The concentration of airborne radioactivity, above natural background, exceeds or is likely to exceed the derived air concentration (DAC) values listed in appendix A or appendix C of this part; or

      (2) An individual present in the area without respiratory protection could receive an intake exceeding 12 DAC-hours in a week.

      means “As Low As is Reasonably Achievable,” which is the approach to radiation protection to manage and control exposures (both individual and collective) to the work force and to the general public to as low as is reasonable, taking into account social, technical, economic, practical, and public policy considerations. As used in this part, _ALARA_ is not a dose limit but a process which has the objective of attaining doses as far below the applicable limits of this part as is reasonably achievable.

      means the derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. ALI is the smaller value of intake of a given radionuclide in a year by the reference man (ICRP Publication 23) that would result in a committed effective dose of 5 rems (0.05 sieverts (Sv)) (1 rem = 0.01 Sv) or a committed equivalent dose of 50 rems (0.5 Sv) to any individual organ or tissue. ALI values for intake by ingestion and inhalation of selected radionuclides are based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 68, , published July, 1994 (ISBN 0 08 042651 4). This document is available from Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY.

      means a limit on the concentration of residual radioactive material on the surfaces or within the property that has been derived consistent with DOE directives including the as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA) process requirements, given the anticipated use of the property and has been authorized by DOE to permit the release of the property from DOE radiological control.

      means, for the radionuclides listed in appendix A of this part, the airborne concentration that equals the ALI divided by the volume of air breathed by an average worker for a working year of 2000 hours (assuming a breathing volume of 2400 m ). For the radionuclides listed in appendix C of this part, the air immersion DACs were calculated for a continuous, non-shielded exposure via immersion in a semi-infinite cloud of radioactive material. Except as noted in the footnotes to appendix A of this part, the values are based on dose coefficients from International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 68, , published July, 1994 (ISBN 0 08 042651 4) and the associated ICRP computer program, , (ISBN 0 08 043 8768). These materials are available from Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY.

**Source:** Source: 49 FR 21473, May 21, 1984, unless otherwise noted.

    § 840.1   Scope and purpose.

#### § § 840.1

    (a)  This subpart applies to those DOE contractor activities to which the nuclear hazards indemnity provisions in 41 CFR 9-50.704-6 apply, and to other persons indemnified with respect to such activities.

    (b)  One purpose of this subpart is to set forth the criteria which the DOE proposes to follow in order to determine whether there has been an “extraordinary nuclear occurrence.” The other purpose is to establish the conditions of the waivers of defenses proposed for incorporation in indemnity agreements.

    (1) The system is to come into effect only where the discharge or dispersal constitutes a substantial amount of source, special nuclear or byproduct material, or has caused substantial radiation levels offsite. The various limits in present DOE regulations are not appropriate for direct application in the determination of an “extraordinary nuclear occurrence,” for they were arrived at with other purposes in mind, and those limits have been set at a level which is conservatively arrived at by incorporating a significant safety factor. Thus, a discharge or dispersal which exceeds the limits in DOE regulations, or in DOE orders, although possible cause for concern, is not one which would be expected to cause substantial injury or damage unless it exceeds by some significant multiple the appropriate regulatory limit. Accordingly, in arriving at the values in the criteria to be deemed “substantial” it is more appropriate to adopt values separate from DOE health and safety orders, and, of course the selection of these values will not in any way affect such orders. A substantial discharge, for purposes of the criteria, represents a perturbation of the environment which is clearly above that which could be anticipated from the conduct of normal activities. The criteria are intended solely for the purposes of administration of DOE statutory responsibilities under Pub. L. 89-645, and are not intended to indicate a level of discharge or dispersal at which damage is likely to occur, or even a level at which some type of protective action is indicated. It should be clearly understood that the criteria in no way establish or indicate that there is a specific threshold of exposure at which biological damage from radiation will take place. It cannot be emphasized too frequently that the levels set to be used as criteria for the first part of the determination, that is, the criteria for amounts offsite or radiation levels offsite which are substantial, are not meant to indicate that, because such amounts or levels are determined to be substantial for purposes of administration, they are “substantial” in terms of their propensity for causing injury or damage.

    (2) It is the purpose of the second part of the determination that DOE decide whether there have in fact been or will probably be substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite. The criteria for substantial damages were formulated, and the numerical values selected, on a wholly different basis from that on which the criteria used for the first part of the determination with respect to substantial discharge were derived. The only interrelation between the values selected for the discharge criteria and the damage criteria is that the discharge values are set so low that it is extremely unlikely the damage criteria could be satisfied unless the discharge values have been exceeded.

    (3) The first part of the test is designed so that DOE can assure itself that something exceptional has occurred; that something untoward and unexpected has in fact taken place and that this event is of sufficient significance to raise the possibility that some damage to persons or property offsite has resulted or may result. If there appears to be no damage, the waivers will not apply because DOE will be unable, under the second part of the test, to make a determination that “substantial damages” have resulted or will probably result. If damages have resulted or will probably result, they could vary from de minimis to serious, and the waivers will not apply until the damages, both actual and probable, are determined to be “substantial” within the second part of the test.

    (4) The presence or absence of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination does not concomitantly determine whether or not a particular claimant will recover on his claim. In effect, it is intended primarily to determine whether certain potential obstacles to recovery are to be removed from the route the claimant would ordinarily follow to seek compensation for his injury or damage. If there has not been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the claimant must proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort action subject to whatever issues must be met, and whatever defenses are available to the defendant, under the law applicable in the relevant jurisdiction. If there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the claimant must still proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort action, but the claimant's burden is substantially eased by the elimination of certain issues which may be involved and certain defenses which may be available to the defendant. In either case the defendant may defend with respect to such of the following matters as are in issue in any given claim: the nature of the claimant's alleged damages, the causal relationship between the event and the alleged damages, and the amount of the alleged damages.

    § 840.2   Procedures.

#### § § 840.2

    (a) DOE may initiate, on its own motion, the making of a determination as to whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. In the event DOE does not so initiate the making of a determination, any affected person, or any person with whom an indemnity agreement is executed may petition DOE for a determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If DOE does not have, or does not expect to have, within 7 days after it has received notification of an alleged event, enough information available to make a determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, DOE will publish a notice in the  setting forth the date and place of the alleged event and requesting any persons having knowledge thereof to submit their information to DOE.

    (b) When a procedure is initiated under paragraph (a) of this section, the principal staff which will begin immediately to assemble the relevant information and prepare a report on which the DOE can make its determination will consist of the Directors or their designees of the following Divisions or Offices: Office of Nuclear Safety, Office of Operational Safety, Office of Health and Environmental Research, the General Counsel or his designee, and a representative of the program division whose facility or device may be involved.

    § 840.3   Determination of extraordinary nuclear occurrence.

#### § § 840.3

    If the DOE determines that both of the criteria set forth in § 840.4 and § 840.5 have been met, it will make the determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If the DOE publishes a notice in the  in accordance with § 840.2(a) and does not make a determination within 90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the alleged event will be deemed not to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. The time for the making of a determination may be extended by DOE by notice published in the

    § 840.4   Criterion I—Substantial discharge of radioactive material or substantial radiation levels offsite.

#### § § 840.4

    DOE will determine that there has been a substantial discharge or dispersal of radioactive material offsite, or that there have been substantial levels of radiation offsite, when as a result of an event comprised of one or more related happenings, radioactive material is released from its intended place of confinement or radiation levels occur offsite and either of the following findings are also made:

    (a) DOE finds that one or more persons offsite were, could have been, or might be exposed to radiation or to radioactive material, resulting in a dose or in a projected dose in excess of one of the levels in the following table:

    Exposures from the following types of sources of radiation shall be included:

    (1) Radiation from sources external to the body;

    (2) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in air or water; and

    (3) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in food or on terrestrial surfaces.

    (b) DOE finds that—

    (1) Surface contamination of at least a total of any 100 square meters of offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material from a production or utilization facility or device and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 1 or column 2 of the following table, or

    (2) Surface contamination of any offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material in the course of transportation and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 2 of the following table:

    § 840.5   Criterion II—Substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite.

#### § § 840.5

    (a) After DOE has determined that an event has satisfied Criterion I, DOE will determine that the event has resulted or will probably result in substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite if any of the following findings are made:

    (1) DOE finds that such event has resulted in the death or hospitalization, within 30 days of the event, of five or more people located offsite showing objective clinical evidence of physical injury from exposure to the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material; or

    (2) DOE finds that $2,500,000 or more of damage offsite has been or will probably be sustained by any one person, or $5 million or more of such damage in the aggregate has been or will probably be sustained, as the result of such event; or

    (3) DOE finds that $5,000 or more of damage offsite has been or will probably be sustained by each of 50 or more persons, provided that $1 million or more of such damage in the aggregate has been or will probably be sustained, as the result of such event.

    (b) As used in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section “damage” shall be that arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material, and shall be based upon estimates of one or more of the following:

    (1) Total cost necessary to put affected property back into use.

    (2) Loss of use of affected property.

    (3) Value of affected property where not practical to restore to use.

    (4) Financial loss resulting from protective actions appropriate to reduce or avoid exposure to radiation or to radioactive materials.

      (A) A detailed medical and work history with emphasis on past, present, and anticipated future exposure to beryllium;

      (B) A respiratory symptoms questionnaire;

      (C) A physical examination with emphasis on the respiratory system;

      (D) A Be-LPT; and

      (E) Any other medical evaluations deemed appropriate by the examining physician for evaluating beryllium-related health effects.

      (ii) The responsible employer must provide to beryllium-associated workers a chest radiograph every five years.

      (3)  The responsible employer must provide a medical evaluation as soon as possible to any worker who may have been exposed to beryllium because of a beryllium emergency. The medical evaluation must include the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (c)  The responsible employer must establish a multiple physician review process for beryllium-associated workers that allows for the review of initial medical findings, determinations, or recommendations from any medical evaluation conducted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

      (1) If the responsible employer selects the initial physician to conduct any medical examination or consultation provided to a beryllium-associated worker, the worker may designate a second physician to:

      (i) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; and

      (ii) Conduct such examinations, consultations and laboratory tests, as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.

      (2) The responsible employer must promptly notify a beryllium-associated worker in writing of the right to seek a second medical opinion after the initial physician provided by the responsible employer conducts a medical examination or consultation.

      (3) The responsible employer may condition its participation in, and payment for, multiple physician review upon the beryllium-associated worker doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, whichever is later:

      (i) Informing the responsible employer in writing that he or she intends to seek a second medical opinion; and

      (ii) Initiating steps to make an appointment with a second physician.

      (4) If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the responsible employer and the beryllium-associated worker must make efforts to encourage and assist the two physicians to resolve any disagreement.

      (5) If, despite the efforts of the responsible employer and the beryllium-associated worker, the two physicians are unable to resolve their disagreement, then the responsible employer and the worker, through their respective physicians, must designate a third physician to:

      (i) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the other two physicians; and

      (ii) Conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and consultations with the other two physicians, as the third physician deems necessary to resolve the disagreement among them.

      (6) The SOMD must act consistently with the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the SOMD and the beryllium-associated worker reach an agreement that is consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the other two physicians.

      (d)  The responsible employer and the beryllium-associated worker or the worker's designated representative may agree upon the use of any alternate form of physician determination in lieu of the multiple physician review process provided by paragraph (c) of this section, so long as the alternative is expeditious and at least as protective of the worker.

      (e)  (1) Within two weeks of receipt of results, the SOMD must provide to the responsible employer a written, signed medical opinion for each medical evaluation performed on each beryllium-associated worker. The written opinion must take into account the findings, determinations and recommendations of the other examining physicians who may have examined the beryllium-associated worker. The SOMD's opinion must contain:

      (i) The diagnosis of the worker's condition relevant to occupational exposure to beryllium, and any other medical condition that would place the worker at increased risk of material impairment to health from further exposure to beryllium;

      (h)  (1) The responsible employer must routinely and systematically analyze medical, job, and exposure data with the aim of identifying individuals or groups of individuals potentially at risk for CBD and working conditions that are contributing to that risk.

      (2) The responsible employer must use the results of these analyses to identify additional workers to whom the responsible employer must provide medical surveillance and to determine the need for additional exposure controls.

      § 850.35   Medical removal.

#### § § 850.35

      (a)  The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker medical removal from exposure to beryllium if the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that it is medically appropriate to remove the worker from such exposure. The SOMD's determination must be based on one or more positive Be-LPT results, chronic beryllium disease diagnosis, an examining physician's recommendation, or any other signs or symptoms that the SOMD deems medically sufficient to remove a worker.

      (1)  The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker temporary medical removal from exposure to beryllium on each occasion that the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be temporarily removed from such exposure pending a final medical determination of whether the worker should be removed permanently.

      (i) In this section, “final medical determination” means the outcome of the multiple physician review process or the alternate medical determination process provided for in paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 850.34.

      (ii) If a beryllium-associated worker is temporarily removed from beryllium exposure pursuant to this section, the responsible employer must transfer the worker to a comparable job for which the worker is qualified (or for which the worker can be trained in a short period) and where beryllium exposures are as low as possible, but in no event at or above the action level.

      (iii) The responsible employer must maintain the beryllium-associated worker's total normal earnings, seniority, and other worker rights and benefits as if the worker had not been removed.

      (iv) If there is no such job available, the responsible employer must provide to the beryllium-associated worker the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, until a job becomes available or for one year, whichever comes first.

      (2)  (i) The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker permanent medical removal from exposure to beryllium if the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be permanently removed from exposure to beryllium.

      (ii) If a beryllium-associated worker is removed permanently from beryllium exposure based on the SOMD's recommendation pursuant to this section, the responsible employer must provide the worker the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (3)  If the SOMD determines that a beryllium-associated worker should be temporarily or permanently removed from exposure to beryllium, the SOMD must:

      (i) Advise the beryllium-associated worker of the determination that medical removal is necessary to protect the worker's health;

      (ii) Provide the beryllium-associated worker with a copy of this rule and its preamble, and any other information the SOMD deems necessary on the risks of continued exposure to beryllium and the benefits of removal;

      (iii) Provide the beryllium-associated worker the opportunity to have any questions concerning medical removal answered; and

      (iv) Obtain the beryllium-associated worker's signature acknowledging that the worker has been advised to accept medical removal from beryllium exposure as provided in this section, and has been provided with the information specified in this paragraph, on the benefits of removal and the risks of continued exposure to beryllium.

      (4)  (i) The responsible employer, subject to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, must not return a beryllium-associated worker who has been permanently removed under this section to the worker's former job status unless the SOMD first determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal is no longer necessary to protect the worker's health.

      (ii) Not withstanding paragraph (a)(4) (i) of this section, if, in the SOMD's opinion, continued exposure to beryllium will not pose an increased risk to the beryllium-associated worker's health, and medical removal is an inappropriate remedy in the circumstances, the SOMD must fully discuss these matters with the worker and then, in a written determination, may authorize the responsible employer to return the worker to his or her former job status. Thereafter, the returned beryllium-associated worker must continue to be provided with medical surveillance under § 850.34 of this part.

      (b)  (1) If a beryllium-associated worker has been permanently removed from beryllium exposure pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the responsible employer must provide the beryllium-associated worker:

      (i) The opportunity to transfer to another position which is available, or later becomes available, for which the beryllium-associated worker is qualified (or for which the worker can be trained in a short period) and where beryllium exposures are as low as possible, but in no event at or above the action level; or

      (ii) If the beryllium-associated worker cannot be transferred to a comparable job where beryllium exposures are below the action level, a maximum of 2 years of permanent medical removal protection benefits (specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

      (2) If required by this section to provide medical removal protection benefits, the responsible employer must maintain the removed worker's total normal earnings, seniority and other worker rights and benefits, as though the worker had not been removed.

      (3) If a removed beryllium-associated worker files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a beryllium-related disability, then the responsible employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. The responsible employer must receive no credit for the workers' compensation payments received by the worker for treatment related expenses.

      (4) The responsible employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed beryllium-associated worker is reduced to the extent that the worker receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly- or employer-funded compensation program, or from employment with another employer made possible by virtue of the worker's removal.

      (5) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that a responsible employer provide medical removal protection benefits is not intended to expand upon, restrict, or change any rights to a specific job classification or position under the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement.

      (6) The responsible employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the beryllium-associated worker's participation in medical surveillance provided in accordance with § 850.34 of this part.

      § 850.36   Medical consent.

#### § § 850.36

      (a) The responsible employer must provide each beryllium-associated worker with a summary of the medical surveillance program established in § 850.34 at least one week before the first medical evaluation or procedure or at any time requested by the worker. This summary must include:

      (1) The type of data that will be collected in the medical surveillance program;

      (2) How the data will be collected and maintained;

      (3) The purpose for which the data will be used; and

      (4) A description of how confidential data will be protected.

      (b) Responsible employers must also provide each beryllium-associated worker with information on the benefits and risks of the medical tests and examinations available to the worker at least one week prior to any such examination or test, and an opportunity to have the worker's questions answered.

      (c) The responsible employer must have the SOMD obtain a beryllium-associated worker's signature on the informed consent form found in Appendix A to this part, before performing medical evaluations or any tests.

      § 850.37   Training and counseling.

A conference is not normally open to the public and DOE does not make a transcript of the conference. The Enforcement Director may compel a contractor to attend the conference.

      (i) If facts disclosed by an investigation or inspection indicate that further action is unnecessary or unwarranted, the Enforcement Director may close the investigation without prejudice.

      (j) The Enforcement Director may issue enforcement letters that communicate DOE's expectations with respect to any aspect of the requirements of this part, including identification and reporting of issues, corrective actions, and implementation of the contractor's safety and health program; provided that an enforcement letter may not create the basis for any legally enforceable requirement pursuant to this part.

      (k) The Enforcement Director may sign, issue and serve subpoenas.

      (b) Based on a determination by the Enforcement Director that a contractor has violated or is continuing to violate a requirement of this part, the Enforcement Director may issue to the contractor a final notice of violation that states concisely the determined violation and any remedy, including the amount of any civil penalty imposed on the contractor. The final notice of violation must state that the contractor may petition the Office of Hearings and Appeals for review of the final notice in accordance with 10 CFR part 1003.

    § 862.5   Procedures for removal of downed aircraft.

#### § § 862.5

    (a) An aircraft on or brought on to a designated site, except as provided in § 862.2 (b)(1), shall not be moved within or removed from such areas except as provided for in this section. All such aircraft are subject to full inspection by DOE security personnel upon landing upon order of the Manager of Operations or his designee. Any attempt to depart or remove the aircraft from a designated site without clearance obtained pursuant to this section, may be assumed to be indicative of hostile intent by security forces at such sites.

    (b)(1) The cognizant DOE Manager of Operations for a designated site may, on his own initiative, issue a written order to the owner or operator of a downed aircraft to require the removal of that aircraft from the site within 20 days of this notice. Such an order shall specify:

    (i) The date upon which removal operations must be completed;

    (ii) The times and means of access to and from the downed aircraft to be removed;

    (iii) The manner of removal; and

    (iv) An estimate of the cost of removal to DOE for which the owner or operator will be held liable if removal is accomplished by DOE.

    (2) The owner or operator of the downed aircraft may file a written petition, supported by affidavits, to the cognizant Manager of Operations requesting that the order be modified or set aside. The petition may be granted by the Manager of Operations for good cause shown, upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national security, public safety, and federal property interests. Such petition must be filed at least 10 days prior to the date upon which removal is to be initiated, as specified in the order. The written decision of the Manager of Operations shall be a final agency action.

    (c)(1) The owner of a downed aircraft may petition the cognizant Manager of Operations of permission to move or remove the downed aircraft from or within a designated site. The petition must provide assurances that the owner will fully compensate DOE for all costs incurred or damages experienced as a result of landing or removal through a contact for services. The Manager of Operations may, for good cause shown, waive part or all of the compensation which might otherwise be due DOE.

    (2) The Manager of Operations may deny such petition in whole or part and prohibit removal of a downed aircraft upon finding that:

    (i) The removal of a downed aircraft would create an unacceptable safety or security risk;

    (ii) The removal of a downed aircraft would result in excessive resource loss of property damage or an unacceptable disruption of federal activities;

    (iii) The removal of downed aircraft is impracticable or impossible;

    (iv) The owner has failed to provide adequate assurances that all costs incurred or damages experienced by DOE due to landing or removal of aircraft will be fully paid immediately upon removal by the owner under a contract for services;

    (v) An inspection of the aircraft has not been conducted by DOE security personnel.

    (3) In the event that such petition is granted in whole or part, the cognizant Manager of Operations may issue an order, as set forth in (b)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. In the event that a petition is denied in whole or part, the Manager of Operations shall issue a written decision which shall set forth the reasons for such denial.

    (d) Failure to comply with an order issued by the Manager of Operations pursuant to this section is basis for DOE to consider the downed aircraft to be abandoned property. DOE may take whatever measures it deems necessary when it determines that downed aircraft is abandoned property.

    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Manager of Operations may move or remove a downed aircraft from such an area upon oral or written notification to the owner or operator of such aircraft upon a finding that national security or operational requirements necessitate expedited movement or removal. The owner or operator may be held jointly and separately liable for all expenses incurred by DOE in the movement or removal of such aircraft. Such expenses shall be deemed to be incurred through an implied contract at law for services.

    § 862.6   Voluntary minimum altitude.

#### § § 862.6

    In addition to complying with all applicable FAA prohibitions or restrictions, aircraft are requested to maintain a minimum altitude of 2,000 feet above the terrain of a designated site. Applicable FAA prohibitions or restrictions take precedence over this voluntary minimum altitude.

    § 862.7   Designation of sites.

#### § § 862.7

    (a) DOE shall designate sites covered by this part as deemed necessary, consistent with the national security and public safety, through notice in the

    (b) This part shall be effective as to any facility, installation, or real property on publication in the  of the notice designating the site.

  PART 900—COORDINATION OF FEDERAL AUTHORIZATIONS FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES

### Part 900

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 824p(h).

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 35367, May 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

    § 900.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 900.1

    (a) Pursuant to section 216(h) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824p(h)), the Department of Energy (DOE) establishes the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program (CITAP Program) under this part to coordinate the review and processes related to Federal authorizations necessary to site a proposed electric transmission facility. Pursuant to section 216(h)(4)(A), this part establishes the mechanism by which DOE will set prompt and binding intermediate milestones and ultimate deadlines for the processes related to deciding whether to issue such authorizations. In addition, as the lead agency and in collaboration with any National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) joint lead agency and in consultation with the relevant Federal entities, as applicable, DOE will prepare a single environmental review document, which will be designed to serve the needs of all relevant Federal agencies and inform all Federal authorization decisions on the proposed electric transmission project.

    (b) This part provides a process for the timely submission of information needed for Federal decisions related to authorizations for siting proposed electric transmission projects. This part seeks to ensure that these projects are developed consistent with the nation's environmental laws, including laws that address endangered and threatened species, critical habitats, and cultural and historic properties. This part provides a framework, called the Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process, by which DOE will coordinate submission of materials necessary for Federal authorizations and related environmental reviews required under Federal law to site proposed electric transmission facilities, and integrates the IIP Process into the CITAP Program.

    (c) This part describes the timing and procedures for the IIP Process, which should be initiated prior to a project proponent's submission of any application for a required Federal authorization. The IIP Process provides for timely and focused pre-application meetings with relevant Federal and non-Federal entities. In addition, the IIP Process facilitates early identification of potential siting constraints and opportunities. The IIP Process promotes thorough and consistent stakeholder engagement by a project proponent. At the close-out of each IIP Process, DOE will establish the schedule for all Federal reviews and authorizations required to site a proposed electric transmission facility, in coordination with the relevant Federal entities.

    (d) This part improves the Federal permitting process by facilitating the early submission, compilation, and documentation of information needed for coordinated review by relevant Federal entities under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 ). This part also facilitates expeditious action on necessary Federal authorizations by ensuring that relevant Federal entities coordinate their consideration of those applications and by providing non-Federal entities the opportunity to coordinate their non-Federal permitting and environmental reviews with the reviews of the relevant Federal entities.

    (e) This part facilitates improved and earlier coordination of and consultation between relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and others pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 306108) (NHPA) and its implementing regulations found at 36 CFR part 800. Under this part, DOE may determine it has an undertaking with the potential to affect historic properties and may, at that time, authorize a project proponent, as a CITAP applicant, to initiate section 106 consultation for the undertaking consistent with 36 CFR 800.2(c)(4). Prior to that determination, this part requires project proponents to gather initial information and make recommendations relevant to the section 106 process to the extent possible. This part also establishes DOE as lead for the section 106 process, consistent with DOE's role as lead or joint lead agency for purposes of NEPA, in order to maximize opportunities for coordination between the NEPA and section 106 processes. Federal entities remain responsible for government-to-government consultation with Indian Tribes (and government-to-sovereign consultation in the context of Native Hawaiian relations) and for any findings and determinations required by and reserved to Federal agencies in 36 CFR part 800.

    (f) This part applies only to qualifying projects as defined by § 900.2.

    (g) Participation in the IIP Process does not alter any requirements to obtain necessary Federal authorizations for proposed electric transmission projects. Nor does this part alter any responsibilities of the relevant Federal entities for environmental review or consultation under applicable law.

    (h) The Director may waive any requirement imposed on a project proponent under this part if, in the Director's discretion, the Director determines that the requirement is unnecessary, duplicative, or impracticable under the circumstances relevant to the proposed electric transmission project. Where the principal project developer is itself a Federal entity that would be otherwise expected to prepare an environmental review document for the project, the Director shall consider modifications to the requirements under this part as may be necessary under the circumstances.

    § 900.2   Definitions.

#### § § 900.2

    As used in this part:

    means a geographical area established for a resource report at the IIP Process initial meeting and modified at the IIP Process review meeting, if applicable.

    means any license, permit, approval, finding, determination, or other administrative decision required under Federal, Tribal, State, or local law to site a proposed electric transmission facility, including special use authorization, certifications, opinions, or other approvals.

    means an approach that applies a conceptual plan to identify appropriate measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for potential impacts to resources from a proposed electric transmission project, consistent with 40 CFR 1508.1(s) or any successor regulation. A mitigation approach identifies the needs and baseline conditions of targeted resources, potential impacts from the proposed project, cumulative impacts of past and reasonably foreseeable future disturbances to those resources, and future disturbance trends, then uses this information to identify priorities for measures across the relevant area. Such an approach includes full consideration of the conditions of additionality (meaning that the benefits of a compensatory mitigation measure improve upon the baseline conditions in a manner that is demonstrably new and would not have occurred without the mitigation measure) and durability (meaning that the effectiveness of a mitigation measure is sustained for the duration of the associated direct and indirect impacts).

    means a Federal entity that has entered into the currently effective memorandum of understanding (MOU) under section 216(h)(7)(B)(i) of the Federal Power Act, such as the interagency MOU executed in May 2023, titled “Memorandum of Understanding among the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, Department of the Interior, and the Office of Management and Budget Regarding Facilitating Federal Authorizations for Electric Transmission Facilities.”

    (i) The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and

    (ii) The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

    means an owner of a real property interest that is potentially affected directly ( crossed or used) or indirectly ( changed in use) by a project right-of-way, potential route, or proposed ancillary or access site, as identified in § 900.6.

    means the area located between the two end points of the proposed electric transmission facility containing the study corridors selected by the project proponent for in-depth consideration for the proposed project and the immediate surroundings of the end points of the proposed facility. The project area does not necessarily coincide with “permit area,” “area of potential effect,” “action area,” or other terms specific to a certain type of regulatory review.

    means a person or entity who initiates the IIP Process in anticipation of seeking a Federal authorization for a proposed electric transmission project.

    means:

    (1) A proposed electric transmission line and its attendant facilities:

    (i) That will either be a high-voltage (230 kV or above) line or a regionally or nationally significant line, as determined by DOE based upon relevant factors, including but not limited to, reduction in congestion costs for generating and delivering energy, mitigation of weather and variable generation uncertainty, and enhanced diversity of supply;

    (iii) Which is expected to require preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) pursuant to NEPA to inform an agency decision on a Federal authorization;

    (iv) Which is not proposed for authorization under section 8(p) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(p));

    (v) Which is not seeking a construction or modification permit from FERC pursuant to section 216(b) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824p(b)); and

    (vi) Which will not be wholly located within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas interconnection; or

    (2) Any other proposed electric transmission facility that is approved by the Director under the process set out in § 900.3.

    means a Federal entity with jurisdictional interests that may have an effect on a proposed electric transmission project, that is responsible for issuing a Federal authorization for the proposed project, that has relevant expertise with respect to environmental and other issues pertinent to or potentially affected by the proposed project, or that provides funding for the proposed project. The term includes participating agencies. The term includes a Federal entity with either permitting or non-permitting authority; for example, those entities with which consultation or review must be completed before a project may commence, such as DOD for an examination of military test, training, or operational impacts.

    means a non-Federal entity with relevant expertise or jurisdiction within the project area, that is responsible for issuing an authorization for the proposed electric transmission project, that has relevant expertise with respect to environmental and other issues pertinent to or potentially affected by the proposed project, or that provides funding for the proposed project.

    means an area along a linear path within which a proposed electric transmission facility could be sited that is:

    (1) Wide enough to allow minor adjustments in the alignment of the proposed facility to avoid sensitive features or to accommodate potential engineering constraints; and

    (2) Narrow enough to allow detailed study.

    means any relevant non-Federal entity, interested non-governmental organization, potentially affected landowner, or other interested person or organization.

    means a contiguous area (not to exceed one mile in width) within the project area where potential routes or route segments may be considered for further study. A study corridor does not necessarily coincide with “permit area,” “area of potential effect,” “action area,” or other defined terms of art that are specific to types of regulatory review.

    § 900.3   Applicability to other projects.

#### § § 900.3

    (a) Following the procedures set out in this section, the Director may determine that a proposed electric transmission facility that does not meet the description of a  under paragraph (1) of the definition in § 900.2 is a  under paragraph (2) of the definition.

    (b) A requestor seeking DOE assistance under this part for a proposed electric transmission facility that does not meet the description of a  under paragraph (1) of the definition in § 900.2 must file a request for coordination with the Director. The request must contain:

    (1) The legal name of the requester; its principal place of business; and the name, title, and mailing address of the person or persons to whom communications concerning the request for coordination are to be addressed;

    (2) A concise description of the proposed facility sufficient to explain its scope and purpose;

    (3) A list of anticipated relevant Federal entities involved in the proposed facility; and

    (4) A list of anticipated relevant non-Federal entities involved in the proposed facility, including any agency serial or docket numbers for pending applications.

    (c) Not later than 30 calendar days after the date that the Director receives a request under this section, the Director, in consultation with the relevant Federal entities, will determine if the proposed electric transmission facility is a qualifying project under this part and will notify the project proponent in writing of one of the following:

    (1) If accepted, that the proposed facility is a qualifying project and the project proponent must submit an initiation request as set forth under § 900.5; or

    (2) If not accepted, that the proposed facility is not a qualifying project, a justification of that determination, and an indication that the project proponent must follow the procedures of each relevant Federal entity that has jurisdiction over the proposed facility without DOE performing a coordinating function.

    (d) In making the determination whether a proposed electric transmission facility is a qualifying project, the Director may consider:

    (1) Whether the proposed facility would benefit from CITAP Program coordination;

    (2) Whether the proposed facility would result in reduced congestion costs for generating and delivering energy;

    (3) Whether the proposed facility would result in mitigation of weather and variable generation uncertainty;

    (4) Whether the proposed facility would result in an enhanced diversity of supply; and

    (5) Any other relevant factors, as determined by the Director.

    (e) For a proposed facility that is seeking a construction or modification permit pursuant to section 216(b) of the Federal Power Act, DOE may only consider a request for assistance under this section if the request under paragraph (b) of this section is consistent with Delegation Order No. S1-DEL-FERC-2006 or any similar, subsequent delegation that the Secretary may order.

    (f) At the discretion of the MOU signatory agencies, this section may be applied to a proposed electric transmission facility proposed for authorization under section 8(p) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, if the proposed authorization is independent of any generation project.

    (g) This section does not apply to:

    (1) A proposed electric transmission facility proposed to be authorized under section 8(p) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in conjunction with a generation project; or

    (2) A proposed electric transmission facility wholly located within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas interconnection.

    § 900.4   Purpose and scope of IIP Process.

#### § § 900.4

    (a) The Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process is intended for a project proponent who has identified potential study corridors or potential routes and the proposed locations of any intermediate substations for a proposed electric transmission project. To the extent possible, the project proponent should use the following criteria to identify potential study corridors and potential routes:

    (1) Potential environmental, visual, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health effects or harm based on the proposed project or proposed siting, and anticipated constraints (for instance, pole height and corridor width based on line capacity to improve safety and resiliency of the project);

    (2) Potential cultural resources, sacred sites, and historic properties that may be eligible for or listed in the National Register of Historic Places;

    (3) Areas under (or potentially under) special protection by State or Federal statute and areas subject to a Federal entity or non-Federal entity decision that could potentially increase the time needed for project evaluation and siting a transmission line route. Such areas may include, but are not limited to, properties or sites that may be of traditional religious or cultural importance to Indian Tribes, National Scenic and Historic Trails, National Landscape Conservation System units managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Land and Water Conservation Fund lands, National Wildlife Refuges, national monuments, National Historic Landmarks, units of the National Park System, national marine sanctuaries, and marine national monuments;

    (4) Opportunities to site potential routes through designated corridors, previously disturbed lands, and lands with existing infrastructure as a means of potentially reducing impacts and known conflicts as well as the time needed for affected Federal land managers to evaluate an application for a Federal authorization if the route is sited through such areas ( colocation with existing infrastructure or location on previously disturbed lands, in energy corridors designated by the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture under section 503 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (Pub. L. 94-579) or section 368 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-58), existing rights-of-way, National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors designated under Federal Power Act section 216(a), or utility corridors identified in a land management plan);

    (5) Potential constraints caused by impacts on military test, training, and operational missions, including impacts on installations, ranges, and airspace;

    (6) Potential constraints caused by impacts on the United States' aviation system;

    (7) Potential constraints caused by impacts to navigable waters of the United States; and

    (8) Potential avoidance, minimization, offsetting, and compensatory (onsite and offsite) measures, developed through a mitigation approach to reduce or offset the potential impact of the proposed project to resources requiring mitigation.

    (b) Participation in the IIP Process is a prerequisite for the coordination provided by DOE between relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and the project proponent.

    (c) The IIP Process ensures early interaction between the project proponents, relevant Federal entities, and relevant non-Federal entities to enhance early understanding by those entities. Through the IIP Process, the project proponent will provide relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities with a clear description of the proposed electric transmission project, the project proponent's siting process, and the environmental and community setting being considered by the project proponent for siting the proposed electric transmission facility; and will coordinate with relevant Federal entities to develop resource reports that will serve as inputs, as appropriate, into the relevant Federal analyses and facilitate early identification of project issues.

    (d) The IIP Process is an iterative process anchored by three meetings: the initial meeting, review meeting, and close-out meeting. These meetings, defined in §§ 900.5, 900.8 and 900.9, are milestones in the process and do not preclude any additional meetings or communications between the project proponent and the relevant Federal entities. The iterative nature of the process is provided for in procedures for evaluating the completeness of submitted materials and the suitability of materials for the relevant Federal entities' decision-making before each milestone.

    (e) DOE, in exercising its responsibilities under this part, will communicate regularly with FERC, electric reliability organizations and electric transmission organizations approved by FERC, relevant Federal entities, and project proponents. DOE will use information technologies to provide opportunities for relevant Federal entities to participate remotely.

    (f) DOE, in exercising its responsibilities under this part, will to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, coordinate the IIP Process with any relevant non-Federal entities. DOE will use information technologies to provide opportunities and reduce burdens for relevant non-Federal entities to participate remotely.

    (g) The Director may at any time require the project proponent to provide additional information necessary to resolve issues raised by the IIP Process.

    (h) Pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information during the IIP Process that the person believes to be confidential and exempt by law from public disclosure should submit two well-marked copies, one marked “confidential” that includes all the information believed to be confidential, and one marked “non-confidential” with the information believed to be confidential deleted or redacted. DOE will make its own determination about the confidential status of the information and treat it according to its determination, in accordance with applicable law. The project proponent must request confidential treatment for all material filed with DOE containing non-public location, character, and ownership information about cultural resources.

    (i) Pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.13, any person submitting information during the IIP Process that the person believes might contain Critical Electric Infrastructure Information (CEII) should submit a request for CEII designation of information.

    (l)  Not later than 10 calendar days following the close of the 10-day review period under paragraph (k) of this section, DOE shall:

    (1) Prepare a final initial meeting summary by incorporating received corrections, as appropriate;

    (2) Add the final summary to the consolidated administrative docket described by § 900.10; and

    (3) Provide an electronic copy of the summary to all relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and the project proponent.

    § 900.6   Project proponent resource reports.

#### § § 900.6

    (a)  The project proponent shall prepare and submit to DOE the 13 project proponent resource reports described in this section. The project proponent may submit the resource reports at any time before requesting a review meeting under § 900.8 and shall, at the direction of DOE, revise resource reports in response to comments received from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities during the Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process.

    (b)  Each resource report must include concise descriptions, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, of the known existing environment and major site conditions. The detail of each resource report must be commensurate with the complexity of the proposal and its potential for environmental impacts. Each topic in each resource report must be addressed or its omission justified. If any resource report topic is not addressed at the time the applicable resource report is filed or its omission is not addressed, the report must explain why the topic is missing. If material required for one resource report is provided in another resource report or in another exhibit, it may be incorporated by reference. If outside material is reasonably available for review and comment, a resource report may incorporate that material by reference by including a citation to the material and a brief summary of the material. Consistent with §§ 900.1(h) and 900.4(g), the Director may modify the requirements of this section to reflect differences in onshore and offshore environments and uses.

    (c)  Failure of the project proponent to provide at least the required initial or revised content will prevent progress through the IIP Process to the IIP Process review or close-out meetings, unless the Director determines that the project proponent has provided an acceptable reason for the item's absence and an acceptable timeline for filing it. Failure to file within the accepted timeline will prevent further progress in the IIP Process.

      § 903.22   Final rate approval.

#### § § 903.22

      (a) Any rate submitted to the FERC for confirmation and approval on a final basis shall be accompanied with such supporting data, studies, and documents as the FERC may require, and also with the transcripts of forums, written answers to questions, written comments, the Administrator's certification, and the statement of principal factors leading to the decision. The FERC shall also be furnished a listing of those customers and other participants in the rate proceeding who have requested they be informed of FERC action concerning the rates.

      (b) If the FERC confirms and approves Provisional Rates on a final basis, such confirmation and approval shall be effective as of the date such rates were placed in effect by the Secretary or his or her designee, as such date may have been adjusted by the Administrator. If the FERC confirms and approves on a final basis rates submitted by the Administrator without interim approval, such confirmation and approval shall be effective on a date set by the FERC.

      (c) If the FERC disapproves Provisional Rates or other submitted rates, the Administrator shall develop Substitute Rates which take into consideration the reasons given by the FERC for its disapproval. If, in the Administrator's judgment, public comment should be invited upon proposed Substitute Rates, the Administrator may provide for a public consultation and comment period before submitting the Substitute Rates. Whether or not such public consultation and comment periods are provided, the Administrator will, upon request, provide customers of the power system and other interested persons with copies of the principal documents used in the development of the Substitute Rates. Within 120 days of the date of FERC disapproval of submitted rates, including Substitute Rates, or such additional time periods as the FERC may provide, the Administrator will submit the Substitute Rates to the FERC. A statement explaining the Administrator's decision shall accompany the submission.

      (d) A Provisional Rate that is disapproved by the FERC shall remain in effect until higher or lower rates are confirmed and approved by the FERC on a final basis or are superseded by other rates placed into effect by the Secretary or his or her designee on an interim basis: Provided, That if the Administrator does not file a Substitute Rate within 120 days of the disapproval or such greater time as the FERC may provide, and if the rate has been disapproved because the FERC determined that it would result in total revenues in excess of those required by law, the rate last previously confirmed and approved on a final basis will become effective on a date and for a period determined by the FERC and revenues collected in excess of such rate during such period will be refunded in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

      (e) If a Substitute Rate confirmed and approved on a final basis by the FERC is higher than the provisional rate which was disapproved, the Substitute Rate shall become effective on a subsequent date set by the FERC, unless a subsequent Provisional Rate even higher than the Substitute Rate has been put into effect. FERC confirmation and approval of the higher Substitute Rate shall constitute final confirmation and approval of the lower disapproved Provisional Rate during the interim period that it was in effect.

      (f) If a Substitute Rate confirmed and approved by the FERC on a final basis is lower than the disapproved provisional rate, such lower rate shall be effective as of the date the higher disapproved rate was placed in effect.

      (g) Any overpayment shall be refunded with interest unless the FERC determines that the administrative cost of a refund would exceed the amount to be refunded, in which case no refund will be required. The interest rate applicable to any refund will be determined by the FERC.

      (h) A rate confirmed and approved by the FERC on a final basis shall remain in effect for such period or periods as the FERC may provide or until a different rate is confirmed, approved and placed in effect on an interim or final basis:  That the Secretary or his or her designee may extend a rate on an interim basis beyond the period specified by the FERC.

The total estimated kW rating will be based on the powerplant output capability with all units in service at 498 feet of net effective head or 1,951,000 kW, whichever is less. The capacity component of the Base Charge shall be applied each billing period to each kW of rated output to which each Contractor is entitled by Contract. Adjustments to the application of the capacity component shall be made during outages which cause significant reductions in capacity as provided by the Contract.

      (c) The energy component of the Base Charge shall be a mills per kWh amount determined by (1) multiplying the estimated average annual revenue requirements developed pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of § 904.5 of these General Regulations by 50 percent and (2) dividing the results of that multiplication by the average annual kWh estimated to be available from the Project. The energy component of the Base Charge shall be applied to each kWh made available to each Contractor, as provided for by Contract, except for the energy purchased by Western, at the request of a Contractor, to meet that Contractor's deficiency in Firm Energy pursuant to section 105(a)(2) of the Hoover Power Plant Act (43 U.S.C. 619(a)(2)) and section F of the Conformed Criteria, and that Contractor's Uprating Program credit carry forward, as provided by Contract.

      (d) Application of the Base Charge to capacity and energy overruns will be provided for by Contract. The capacity component and the energy component of the Base Charge shall be applied each billing period for each Contractor.

      (e) The Base Charge shall be reviewed annually. The Base Charge shall be adjusted either upward or downward, when necessary and administratively feasible, to assure sufficient revenues to effect payment of all costs and financial obligations associated with the Project pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of § 904.5 of these General Regulations. The Administrator shall provide all Contractors an opportunity to comment on any proposed adjustment to the Base Charge pursuant to the DOE's power rate adjustment procedures then in effect.

      § 904.8   Lower basin development fund contribution charge.

#### § § 904.8

      (a) The Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge will be developed by the Administrator of Western on the basis that the equivalent of 4  mills or 2  mills per kWh, as appropriate, required to be included in the rates charged to purchasers pursuant to section 1543(c)(2) of the Basin Act, as amended by the Hoover Power Plant Act, shall be collected from the energy sales of the Project.

      (b) The Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge shall be applied to each kWh made available to each Contractor, as provided for by Contract, except for the energy purchased by Western at the request of a Contractor to meet:

      (1) That Contractor's deficiency in Firm Energy, pursuant to section 105(a)(2) of the Hoover Power Plant Act (43 U.S.C. 619(a)(2)) and section F of the Conformed Criteria; and

      (2) That Contractor's Uprating Program credit carry forward as provided by Contract. A 4  mills per kWh charge shall be applied to each kWh made available to an Arizona Contractor, and a 2  mills per kWh charge shall be applied to each kWh made available to a California or Nevada Contractor; provided, that after the repayment period of the Central Arizona Project, a 2  mills per kWh charge shall be applied to each kWh made available to the Arizona, California, and Nevada Contractors. The Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge shall be applied to energy overruns. The Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge shall be applied each billing period for each Contractor.

      § 904.9   Excess capacity.

#### § § 904.9

      (a) If the Uprating Program results in Excess Capacity, Western shall be entitled to such Excess Capacity to integrate the operation of the Boulder City Area Projects and other Federal Projects on the Colorado River. Specific criteria for the use of Excess Capacity by Western will be provided by Contract. All Excess Capacity not required by Western for the purposes specified by Contract will be available to all Contractors at no additional cost on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of each Contractor's Capacity allocation to the total Capacity allocation.

      (b) Credits for benefits resulting from project integration shall be determined by Western and such benefits shall be apportioned in accordance with paragraph (9) of § 904.5 of these General Regulations.

      § 904.10   Excess energy.

#### § § 904.10

      (a) If excess Energy is determined by the United States to be available, it shall be made available to the Contractors, in accordance with the priority entitlement of section 105(a)(1)(C) of the Hoover Power Plant Act (43 U.S.C. 619(a)(1)(c)). After the annual first- and second-priority entitlement to excess energy has been obligated for delivery, Western will make available one-third of the third-priority excess energy to the Arizona Power Authority, one-third to the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, and one-third to the California Contractors.

      (b) Western will make available third-priority excess energy to the California Contractors based on the following formula:

      (c) The charge for all Excess Energy shall be the charge for Boulder Canyon Project Firm Energy existing at the time the Excess Energy is made available to the Contractor, including the appropriate Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge.

      § 904.11   Lay off of energy.

#### § § 904.11

      (a) If any Contractor determines that it is temporarily unable to utilize Firm Energy or Excess Energy, Western will, at the Contractor's request, attempt to lay off the Firm Energy or Excess Energy the Contractor declares to be available for lay off, pursuant to the provisions for lay off of energy specified in the Contract.

      (b) If Western is unable to lay off such energy, or if the Contractor fails to request Western to attempt to lay off the energy, the Contractor will be billed for the Firm Energy or Excess Energy that was available to the Contractor but could not be delivered to the Contractor or sold to another customer.

      (c) In the event that Western must lay off the Firm Energy or Excess Energy at a rate lower than the effective Firm Energy rate, the Contractor will be billed for the difference between the amount that Western would have received at the then existing Firm Energy rate, including the appropriate Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge, and the amount actually received.

      § 904.12   Payments to contractors.

#### § § 904.12

      (a) Funds advanced to the Secretary of the Interior for the Uprating Program and costs reasonably incurred by the Contractor in advancing such funds, as approved by Western, shall be returned to the Contractor advancing the funds during the Contract period through credits on that Contractor's power bills. Appropriate credits will be developed and applied pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by contract or agreement.

      (b) All other obligations of the United States to return funds to a Contractor shall be repaid to such Contractor through credits on power bills, with or without interest, pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by contract or agreement.

      § 904.13   Disputes.

The options evaluated should relate to the resource situation unique to each Western customer as determined by profile data (such as service area, geographical characteristics, customer mix, historical loads, projected growth, existing system data, rates, and financial information) and load forecasts. Specific details of the customer's resource comparison need not be provided in the IRP itself. They must, however, be made available to Western upon request.

      (i) Supply-side options include, but are not limited to, purchased power contracts and conventional and renewable generation options.

      (ii) Demand-side options alter the customer's use pattern to provide for an improved combination of energy services to the customer and the ultimate consumer.

      (iii) Considerations that may be used to develop potential options include cost, market potential, consumer preferences, environmental impacts, demand or energy impacts, implementation issues, revenue impacts, and commercial availability.

      (iv) The IRP discussion of resource options must describe the options chosen by the customer, clearly demonstrating that decisions were based on a reasonable analysis of the options. The IRP may strike a balance among the applicable resource evaluation factors.

      (2)  IRPs must include an action plan describing specific actions the customer will take to implement its IRP.

      (i) The IRP must state the time period that the action plan covers, and the action plan must be updated and resubmitted to Western when this time period expires. The customer may submit a revised action plan with the annual IRP progress report discussed in § 905.14.

      (ii) For those customers not experiencing or anticipating load growth, the action plan requirement for the IRP may be satisfied by a discussion of current actions and procedures in place to periodically reevaluate the possible future need for new resources. The action plan must include a summary of:

      (A) Actions the customer expects to take in accomplishing the goals identified in the IRP;

      (B) Milestones to evaluate accomplishment of those actions during implementation; and

      (C) Estimated energy and capacity benefits for each action planned.

      (3)  To the extent practical, the customer must minimize adverse environmental effects of new resource acquisitions and document these efforts in the IRP. Customers are neither precluded from nor required to include a quantitative analysis of environmental externalities as part of the IRP process. IRPs must include a qualitative analysis of environmental effects in summary format.

      (4)  The customer must provide ample opportunity for full public participation in preparing and developing an IRP (or any IRP revision or amendment). The IRP must include a brief description of public involvement activities, including how the customer gathered information from the public, identified public concerns, shared information with the public, and responded to public comments. Customers must make additional documentation identifying or supporting the full public process available to Western upon request.

      (i) As part of the public participation process for an MBA, the governing body of an MBA must approve the IRP in accordance with the MBA's by-laws, confirming that all requirements have been met. To indicate approval in the case of an individual IRP submitted by an entity with a board of directors or city council, a responsible official must sign the IRP submitted to Western or the customer must document passage of an approval resolution by the appropriate governing body included or referred to in the IRP.

      (ii) For Western customers that do not purchase electricity for resale, such as some State, Tribal, and Federal agencies, the customer can satisfy the public participation requirement by having a top management official with resource acquisition responsibility review and concur on the IRP. The customer must note this concurrence in the IRP.

      (5)  An IRP must include a statement that the customer conducted load forecasting. Load forecasting should include data that reflects the size, type, resource conditions, and demographic nature of the customer using an accepted load forecasting method, including but not limited to the time series, end-use, and econometric methods. The customer must make the load forecasting data available to Western upon request.

      (6)  The IRP must include a brief description of measurement strategies for options identified in the IRP to determine whether the IRP's objectives are being met. These validation methods must include identification of the baseline from which a customer will measure the benefits of its IRP implementation. A reasonable balance may be struck between the cost of data collection and the benefits resulting from obtaining exact information. Customers must make performance validation and evaluation data available to Western upon request.

      (c)  Customers with limited economic, managerial, and resource capability and total annual sales and usage of 25 gigawatthours (GWh) or less who are members of joint-action agencies and generation and transmission cooperatives with power supply responsibility are eligible for the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

      (1) Each IRP submitted by a customer under paragraph (c) of this section must:

      (i) Consider all reasonable opportunities to meet future energy service requirements using DSM techniques, renewable energy resources, and other programs; and

      (ii) Minimize, to the extent practical, adverse environmental effects.

      (2) Each IRP submitted by a customer under paragraph (c) of this section must include, in summary form:

      (i) Customer name, address, phone number, email and Website if applicable, and contact person;

      (ii) Customer type;

      (iii) Current energy and demand profiles, and data on total annual energy sales and usage for the past 5 years, which Western will use to verify that customers qualify for these criteria;

      (iv) Future energy services projections;

      (v) How items in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section were considered; and

      (vi) Actions to be implemented over the customer's planning timeframe.

      § 905.12   How must IRPs be submitted?

#### § § 905.12

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, one IRP is required per customer, regardless of the number of long-term firm power contracts between the customer and Western.

      (b)  Customers must submit IRPs to Western under one of the following options:

      (1) Customers may submit IRPs individually.

      (2) MBAs may submit IRPs for each of their members or submit one IRP on behalf of all or some of their members. An IRP submitted by an MBA must specify the responsibilities and participation levels of individual members and the MBA. Any member of an MBA may submit an individual IRP to Western instead of being included in an MBA IRP.

      (3) Customers may submit IRPs as regional/IRP cooperatives when previously approved by Western. Western encourages customers to prepare “regional” IRPs. Regional IRPs are voluntary and participants need not be members of an MBA or a Western customer. Regional/IRP cooperatives may also submit small customer plans, minimum investment reports, and EE/RE reports on behalf of eligible IRP cooperative members.

      (c)  Customers with Western approval to submit small customer plans, minimum investment or EE/RE reports may substitute the applicable plan or report instead of an IRP. Each customer that intends to seek approval for IRP cooperative, small customer, minimum investment report or EE/RE report status must provide advance written notification to Western. A new customer must provide this notification to the Western Regional Manager of the Region in which the customer is located within 30 days from the time it becomes a customer. Any customer may resubmit an IRP or notify Western of its plan to change its compliance method at any time so long as there is no period of noncompliance.

> [65 FR 16795, Mar. 30, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 35062, June 20, 2008]

      § 905.13   When must IRPs be submitted?

#### § § 905.13

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, customers that have not previously had an IRP approved by Western must submit the initial IRP to the appropriate Regional Manager no later than 1 year after May 1, 2000, or after becoming a customer, whichever is later.

      (b)  Customers must submit updated IRPs to the appropriate Regional Manager every 5 years after Western's approval of the initial IRP. Customers that complied with Western's IRP regulations in effect before May 1, 2000 must maintain their submission and resubmission schedules previously in effect. Customers may submit amendments and revisions to IRPs at any time.

      (c)  Customers with geographic, resource supply, and other similarities may join together and request, in writing, Western's approval to become an IRP cooperative. Western will respond to IRP cooperative status requests within 30 days of receiving a request. If Western disapproves a request for IRP cooperative status, the requesting participants must maintain their currently applicable integrated resource or small customer plans, or submit the initial IRPs no later than 1 year after the date of the disapproval letter. Western's approval of IRP cooperative status will not be based on any potential participant's contractual status with Western. Each IRP cooperative must submit an IRP for its participants within 18 months after Western approves IRP cooperative status.

      § 905.14   Does Western require annual IRP progress reports?

#### § § 905.14

      Yes, customers must submit IRP progress reports each year within 30 days of the anniversary date of the approval of the currently applicable IRP. The reports must describe the customer's accomplishments achieved under the action plan, including projected goals and implementation schedules, and energy and capacity benefits and renewable energy developments achieved as compared to those anticipated. Western prefers measured values, but will accept reasonable estimates if measurement is infeasible or not cost-effective. Instead of a separate progress report, the customer may use any other annual report that the customer submits to Western or another entity, at the customer's discretion, if that report contains all required data for the previous full year and is submitted within 30 days of the approval anniversary date of the currently applicable IRP. With Western's approval, customers may submit reports outside of the 30-day anniversary date window.

      § 905.15   What are the requirements for the small customer plan alternative?

#### § § 905.15

      (a)  Small customers may submit a request to prepare a small customer plan instead of an IRP. Requests for small customer status from electric utilities must include data on total annual energy sales and usage for the 5 years prior to the request. Western will average this data to determine overall annual energy sales and usage so that uncontrollable events, such as extreme weather, do not distort levelized energy sales and usage. Requests from end-use customers must only document that the customer does not purchase electricity for resale. Western will respond to small customer status requests within 30 days of receiving the request. If Western disapproves a request, the customer must maintain its currently applicable IRP, or submit the initial IRP no later than 1 year after the date of the disapproval letter. Alternatively, the customer may submit a request for minimum investment report or EE/RE report status, as appropriate.

      (b)  Small customer plans must:

      (1) Consider all reasonable opportunities to meet future energy service requirements using demand-side management techniques, renewable energy resources, and other programs that provide retail consumers with electricity at reasonable cost;

      (2) Minimize, to the extent practical, adverse environmental effects; and

      (3) Present in summary form the following information:

      (i) Customer name, address, phone number, email and Website if applicable, and contact person;

      (ii) Type of customer;

      (iii) Current energy and demand profiles and data on total annual energy sales and usage for the previous 5 years for utility customers, or current energy and demand use for end-use customers;

      (iv) Future energy services projections;

      (v) How items in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section were considered; and

      (vi) Actions to be implemented over the customer's planning timeframe.

      (c)  Small customers must submit the first small customer plan to the appropriate Western Regional Manager within 1 year after Western approves the request for small customer status. Small customers must submit, in writing, a small customer plan every 5 years.

      (d)  (1) Every year on the anniversary of Western's approval of the plan, small customers must submit a letter to Western verifying that either their annual energy sales and usage is 25 GWh or less averaged over the previous 5 years, or they continue to be end-use customers. The letter must also identify their achievements against targeted action plans, as well as the revised summary of actions if the previous summary of actions has expired.

      (2) Western will use the letter for overall program evaluation and comparison with the customer's plan, and for verification of continued small customer status. Customers may submit annual update letters outside of the anniversary date if previously agreed to by Western so long as the letter contains all required data for the previous full year.

      (e)  (1) A customer ceases to be a small customer if it:

      (i) Is a utility customer and exceeds total annual energy sales and usage of 25 GWh, as averaged over the previous 5 years; or

      (ii) Is no longer an end-use customer.

      (2) Western will work with a customer that loses small customer status to develop an appropriate schedule for submitting an IRP or other report required under this subpart.

      § 905.16   What are the requirements for the minimum investment report alternative?

#### § § 905.16

      (a)  Customers may submit a request to prepare a minimum investment report instead of an IRP. Minimum investment reports may be submitted by MBAs on behalf of the MBA or its members, and by IRP cooperatives on behalf of its participants. Requests to submit minimum investment reports must include data on:

      (1) The source of the minimum investment requirement (number, title, date, and jurisdiction of law);

      (2) The initial, annual, and other reporting requirement(s) of the mandate, if any; and

      (3) The mandated minimum level of investment or public benefits charge for DSM and/or renewable energy.

      (b)  The minimum investment must be either:

      (1) A mandatory set percentage of customer gross revenues or other specific minimum investment in DSM and/or renewable energy mandated by a State, Tribal, or Federal Government with jurisdictional authority; or

      (2) A required public benefits charge, including charges to be collected for and spent on DSM; renewable energy; efficiency and alternative energy-related research and development; low-income energy assistance; and any other applicable public benefits category, mandated by a State, Tribal, or Federal Government with jurisdictional authority. Participation in a public benefits program requires either a mandatory set percentage of customer gross revenues or other specific charges to be applied toward the programs as determined by the applicable State, Tribal, or Federal authority. The revenues from the public benefits charge may be expended directly by the customer, or by another entity on behalf of the customer as determined by the applicable State, Tribal, or Federal authority.

      (c)  For those customers with service territories lying in more than one State or Tribal jurisdiction, and where at least one of the States or Tribal jurisdictions has a mandated minimum investment requirement, to meet this alternative customers must use the highest requirement from the State or Tribe within the customer's service territory and additionally apply it to all members in those States or Tribal jurisdictions in which there is no requirement. Alternatively, if each State or Tribe has a requirement, customers may satisfy Western's requirement by reporting on compliance with each applicable minimum investment requirement. Western will work with multi-state entities to ensure the most effective, and least burdensome, compliance mechanism.

      (d)  Western will respond to requests to accept minimum investment reports within 30 days of receiving the request. If Western disapproves a request to allow use of the minimum investment report, the customer must maintain its currently applicable IRP or small customer plan, or submit its initial IRP no later than 1 year after the date of the disapproval letter. Alternatively, the customer may submit a request for small customer plan or EE/RE report status, as appropriate.

      (e)  Reports documenting compliance with a minimum level of investment in DSM and/or renewable energy must include:

      (1) Customer name, address, phone number, email and Website if applicable, and contact person;

      (2) Authority or requirement to undertake a minimum investment, including the source of the minimum investment requirement (number, title, date, and jurisdiction of law or regulation); and

      (3) A description of the minimum investment, including:

      (i) Minimum percentage or other minimum requirement for DSM and/or renewable energy, including any charges to be collected for and spent on DSM, renewable energy, efficiency or alternative energy-related research and development, low-income energy assistance, and any other applicable public benefits categories;

      (ii) Actual or estimated energy and/or capacity savings resulting from minimum investments in DSM, if known;

      (iii) Actual or estimated energy and/or capacity resulting from minimum investments in renewable energy, if known; and

      (iv) A description of the DSM and/or renewable energy activities to be undertaken over the next 2 years as a result of the requirement for minimum investment, if known.

      (f)  Western will approve the minimum investment report when it meets the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (g)  The customer must submit the first minimum investment report to the appropriate Western Regional Manager within 1 year after Western approves the request to accept the minimum investment report. Customers choosing this option must maintain IRP or small customer plan compliance with Western's IRP regulations in effect before May 1, 2000, including submitting annual progress reports or update letters, until submitting the first minimum investment report, to ensure there is no gap in complying with section 114 of EPAct. Customers must submit, in writing, a minimum investment report every 5 years.

      (h)  (1) Every year on the anniversary of Western's approval of the first minimum investment report, customers choosing this option must submit a letter to Western verifying that they remain in compliance with the minimum investment requirement. The letter must also contain summary information identifying annual energy and capacity savings associated with minimum investments in DSM, if known, and energy and capacity associated with minimum investments in renewable energy, if known. The letter must also include a revised description of customer DSM and/or renewable energy activities if the description from the minimum investment report has changed or expired.

      (2) Western will use the letter for overall program evaluation and to ensure customers remain in compliance. Customers may submit letters outside of the anniversary date if previously agreed to by Western, and if the letter contains all required data for the previous full year. Instead of a separate letter, a customer choosing this option may submit the State, Tribal, or Federal required annual report documenting the minimum investment and associated DSM and/or renewable energy savings and/or use, if known.

      (i)  (1) A customer ceases to be eligible to submit a minimum investment report if:

      (i) A State, Tribal, or Federal mandate no longer applies to the customer, or

      (ii) The customer does not comply with the minimum level of investment in applicable State, Tribal, or Federal law.

      (2) Western will work with a customer no longer eligible to submit a minimum investment report to develop an appropriate schedule to submit an IRP or other plan or report required under this subpart.

      § 905.17   What are the requirements for the energy efficiency and/or renewable energy report (EE/RE report) alternative?

#### § § 905.17

      (a)  End-use customers may submit a request to prepare an EE/RE report instead of an IRP. Requests to submit EE/RE reports must include data on:

      (1) The source of the EE/RE reporting requirement (number, title, date, and jurisdiction of law or regulation);

      (2) The initial, annual, and other reporting requirement(s) of the report; and

      (3) A summary outline of the EE/RE report's required data or components, including any requirements for documenting customer energy efficiency and renewable energy activities.

      (b)  The EE/RE report is based on a mandate by a State, Tribal, or Federal Government to implement energy efficiency and/or renewable energy activities within a specified timeframe, for which there is also an associated reporting requirement. The EE/RE report may include only electrical resource use and energy efficiency and/or renewable energy activities, or may additionally include other resource information, such as water and natural gas data. At a minimum, the EE/RE report must annually document energy efficiency and/or renewable energy activities undertaken by the end-use customer.

      (c)  Western will respond to requests to accept EE/RE reports within 30 days of receiving the request. If Western disapproves a request to allow use of the EE/RE report, the customer must maintain its currently applicable IRP or small customer plan, or submit its initial IRP no later than 1 year after the date of the disapproval letter. Alternatively, the customer may submit a request for small customer plan or minimum investment report, as appropriate, within 30 days after the date of the disapproval letter.

      (d)  EE/RE reports must include:

      (1) Customer name, address, phone number, email and Website if applicable, and contact person;

      (2) Authority or requirement to complete the EE/RE report, including the source of the requirement (number, title, date, and jurisdiction of law); and

      (3) A description of the customer's required energy efficiency and/or renewable energy activities, including:

      (i) Level of investment or expenditure in energy efficiency and/or renewable energy, and quantifiable energy savings or use goals, if defined by the EE/RE reporting requirement;

      (ii) Annual actual or estimated energy and/or capacity savings, if any, associated with energy efficiency and resulting from the EE/RE reporting requirement;

      (iii) Actual or estimated energy and/or capacity, if any, associated with renewable energy and resulting from the EE/RE reporting requirement;

      (iv) A description of the energy efficiency and/or renewable energy activities to be undertaken over the next 2 years as a result of the EE/RE reporting requirement.

      (e)  Western will approve the EE/RE report when the report meets the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (f)  The customer must submit the first EE/RE report to the appropriate Western Regional Manager within 1 year after Western approves the request to accept the EE/RE report. Customers choosing this option must maintain IRP or small customer plan compliance with Western's IRP regulations in effect before May 1, 2000, including submitting annual progress reports or update letters, until submitting the first EE/RE report to ensure there is no gap in complying with section 114 of EPAct. Customers must submit, in writing, an EE/RE report every 5 years.

      (g)  (1) Every year on the anniversary of Western's approval of the first EE/RE report, customers choosing this option must submit an annual EE/RE letter to Western. The letter must contain summary information identifying customer annual energy and capacity savings associated with energy efficiency, if any, and annual customer energy and capacity associated with renewable energy, if any. The letter must also verify that the customer remains in compliance with the EE/RE reporting requirement. Additionally, the letter must include a revised description of customer DSM and/or renewable energy activities if the description from the EE/RE report has changed or expired. If this information is contained in an EE/RE report sent to another authority, the customer may submit that report instead of a separate letter.

      (2) Customers may submit annual EE/RE letters outside of the anniversary date if previously agreed to by Western if the letter contains all required data for the previous full year.

      (h)  (1) A customer ceases to be eligible to submit a EE/RE report if:

      (i) The EE/RE reporting requirement no longer applies to the customer, or

      (ii) The customer does not comply with the EE/RE reporting requirements in applicable State, Tribal, or Federal law.

      (2) Western will work with a customer no longer eligible to submit an EE/RE report to develop an appropriate schedule to submit a small customer plan or other plan or report required under this subpart.

      § 905.18   What are the criteria for Western's approval of submittals?

#### § § 905.18

      (a)  Western will approve all plans and reports based upon:

      (1) Whether the plan or report satisfactorily addresses the criteria in the regulations in this subpart; and

      (2) The reasonableness of the plan or report given the size, type, resource needs, geographic area, and competitive situation of the customer.

      (b)  Western will review resource choices using section 114 of EPAct and this subpart. Western will disapprove plans and reports if Western deems that they do not meet the reasonableness criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the provisions of section 114 of EPAct.

      (c)  If a customer or group of customers implements integrated resource planning under a program responding to other Federal, Tribal, or State initiatives, Western will accept and approve the plan or report as long as it substantially complies with the requirements of this subpart.

      (d)  In evaluating a plan or report, Western will consider water planning, efficiency improvements, and conservation in the same manner it considers energy planning and efficiencies. Customers that provide water utility services and customers that service irrigation load as part of their overall load may include water conservation activities in their plans or reports. To the extent practical, customers should convert reported water savings to energy values.

      § 905.19   How are plans and reports reviewed and approved?

#### § § 905.19

      Western will review all plans and reports submitted under this subpart and notify the submitting entity of the plan's or report's acceptability within 120 days after receiving it. If a plan or report submittal is insufficient, Western will provide a notice of deficiencies to the entity that submitted the plan or report. Western, working together with the entity, will determine the time allowable for resubmitting the plan or report. However, the time allowed for resubmittal will not be greater than 9 months after the disapproval date, unless otherwise provided by applicable contract language.

      § 905.20   When are customers in noncompliance with the regulations in this subpart, and how does Western ensure compliance?

#### § § 905.20

      (a)  If it appears that a customer's activities may be inconsistent with the applicable IRP, small customer plan, minimum investment report or EE/RE report, Western will notify the customer and offer the customer 30 days to provide evidence of its good faith effort to comply. If the customer does not correct the specified deficiency or submit such evidence, or if Western finds, after receiving information from the customer, that a good faith effort has not been made, Western will impose a penalty.

      (b)  Western will impose a penalty on long-term firm power customers for failing to submit or resubmit an acceptable IRP and action plan, small customer plan, minimum investment report or EE/RE report as required by this subpart. Western will also impose a penalty when the customer's activities are not consistent with the applicable plan or report unless Western finds that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan or report.

      (c)  Western will provide written notice of a penalty to the customer, and to the MBA or IRP cooperative when applicable. The notice will specify the reasons for the penalty.

      (d)  (1) Beginning with the first full billing period following the notice specified in paragraph (c) of this section, Western will impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the monthly power charges until the deficiency specified in the notice is cured, or until 12 months pass. However, Western will not immediately impose a penalty if the customer or its MBA or IRP cooperative requests reconsideration by filing a written appeal under § 905.21.

      (2) The surcharge increases to 20 percent for the second 12 months and to 30 percent per year thereafter until the deficiency is cured.

      (3) After the first 12 months of the surcharge and instead of imposing any further surcharge, Western may impose a penalty that would reduce the resource delivered under a customer's long-term firm power contract(s) by 10 percent. Western may impose this resource reduction either:

      (i) When it appears to be more effective to ensure customer compliance, or

      (ii) When such reduction may be more cost-effective for Western.

      (4) The penalty provisions in existing contracts will continue to be in effect and administered and enforced according to applicable contract provisions.

      (e)  Western will assess the surcharge on the total charges for all power obtained by a customer from Western and will not be limited to surcharges on only firm power sales. When a customer resolves the deficiencies, Western will cease imposing the penalty, beginning with the first full billing period after compliance is achieved.

      (f)  In situations involving a plan or report submitted by an MBA on behalf of its members where a single member does not comply, Western will impose a penalty upon the MBA on a pro rata basis in proportion to that member's share of the total MBA's power received from Western. In situations involving noncompliance by a participant of an IRP cooperative, Western will impose any applicable penalty directly upon that participant if it has a firm power contract with Western. If the IRP cooperative participant does not have a firm power contract with Western, then Western will impose a penalty upon the participant's MBA on a pro rata basis in proportion to that participant's share of the total MBA's power received from Western.

      § 905.21   What is the administrative appeal process?

#### § § 905.21

      (a)  If a customer disagrees with Western's decision on the acceptability of its IRP, small customer plan, minimum investment report or EE/RE report submittal, its compliance with an approved plan or report, or any other compliance issue, the customer may request reconsideration by filing a written appeal with the appropriate Regional Manager. Customers may submit appeals any time such disagreements occur and should be specific as to the nature of the issue, the reasons for the disagreement, and any other pertinent facts the customer believes should be brought to Western's attention. The Regional Manager will respond within 45 days of receiving the appeal. If resolution is not achieved at the Regional Office level, the customer may appeal to the Administrator, who will respond within 30 days of receiving the appeal.

      (b)  Upon request, Western will agree to use mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution procedures, to the extent allowed by law, to resolve issues or disputes relating to compliance with the regulations in this subpart.

      (c)  Western will not impose a penalty while an appeal process is pending. However, if the appeal is unsuccessful for the customer, Western will impose the penalty retroactively from the date the penalty would have been assessed if an appeal had not been filed.

      (d)  A written appeal or use of alternative dispute resolution procedures does not suspend other reporting and compliance requirements.

      § 905.22   How does Western periodically evaluate customer actions?

#### § § 905.22

      (a)  Western will periodically evaluate customer actions to determine whether they are consistent with the approved IRP or minimum investment report. Small customer plans and EE/RE reports are not subject to this periodic review.

      (b)  Western will periodically review a representative sample of IRPs and minimum investment reports, and the customer's implementation of the applicable plan or report from each of Western's Regions. The samples will reflect the diverse characteristics and circumstances of the customers that purchase power from Western. These reviews will be in addition to, and separate and apart from, the review of initial and updated IRPs and minimum investment reports to ensure compliance with this subpart.

      (c)  Periodic reviews may consist of any combination of review of the customer's annual IRP progress reports, minimum investment letters, telephone interviews, or on-site visits. Western will document these periodic reviews and may report on the results of the reviews in Western's annual report.

      § 905.23   What are the opportunities for using the Freedom of Information Act to request plan and report data?

#### § § 905.23

      IRPs, small customer plans, minimum investment reports and EE/RE reports and associated data submitted to Western are subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and may be made available to the public upon request. IRPs must be posted on a customer's publicly available Web site or on Western's Web site.

      § 905.24   Will Western conduct reviews of this program?

#### § § 905.24

      Yes, Western may periodically initiate a public process to review the regulations in this subpart to determine whether they should be revised to reflect changes in technology, needs, or other developments.

    Subpart C—Power Marketing Initiative

      § 905.30   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 905.30

      (a) The Power Marketing Initiative (PMI) provides a framework for marketing Western's long-term firm hydroelectric resources. For covered projects, Western will make a major portion of the resources currently under contract available to existing long-term firm power customers for a period of time beyond the expiration date of their current contracts.

      (b) The Western projects covered by this subpart are the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division and the Loveland Area Projects (LAP). The PMI applies to covered projects to the extent it is consistent with other contractual and legal rights, and subject to any applicable project-specific environmental requirements.

      § 905.31   Term.

#### § § 905.31

      Western will extend resource commitments for 20 years from the date existing contracts expire to existing customers with long-term firm power contracts from projects identified in section 905.30(b).

      § 905.32   Resource extensions and resource pool size.

#### § § 905.32

      (a) Western will extend a project-specific percentage of the marketable resource, determined to be available at the time future resource extensions begin, to existing customers with long-term firm power contracts. The remaining unextended power will be used to establish project-specific resource pools. An initial level of 96 percent of the marketable resource will be extended for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division and the Loveland Area Projects.

      (b) At two 5-year intervals after the effective date of the extension to existing customers, Western shall create a project-specific resource pool increment of up to an additional 1 percent of the long-term marketable resource under contract at the time. The size of the additional resource pool increment shall be determined by Western based on consideration of the actual fair-share needs of eligible new customers and other appropriate purposes.

      (c) The initial pool percentages shall be applied to the marketable resource determined to be available at the time future resource extensions begin. Subsequent percentages shall be applied to the resource under contract at the time.

      (d) The additional resource pool increments shall be established by pro rata withdrawals, on 2 years' notice, from then-existing customers. Withdrawals could be mitigated or delayed if good water conditions exist.

      (e) Once the extensions for existing customers and allocations to new customers from the resource pool have been made, additional power resources may become available for various reasons. Any additional available resources will be used as follows:

      (1) If power is reserved for new customers but not allocated, or resources are offered but not placed under contract, this power will be offered on a pro rata basis to customers that contributed to the resource pool through application of the extension formula in § 905.33.

      (2) If power resources become available as a result of the enhancement of existing generation, project-use load efficiency upgrades, the development of new resources, or resources turned back to Western, Western may elect to use this power to reduce the need to acquire firming resources, retain the power for operational flexibility, sell these resources on a short-term basis, or allocate the power.

      (3) If resources become available due to imposition of penalties pursuant to § 905.17, Western may make such resources available within the marketing area to existing customers that are in compliance with subpart B, subject to withdrawal.

      § 905.33   Extension formula.

#### § § 905.33

      (a) The amount of power to be extended to an existing customer shall be determined according to this formula:

      Customer Contract Rate of Delivery (CROD) today/total project CROD under contract today × project-specific percentage × marketable resource determined to be available at the time future resource extensions begin = CROD extended.

      (b) Where contract rates of delivery vary by season, the formula shall be used on a seasonal basis to determine the extended power resource. A similar pro rata approach shall be used for energy extensions.

      (c) Determination of the amount of resource available after existing contracts expire, if significantly different from existing resource commitments, shall take place only after an appropriate public process.

      (d) The formula set forth in paragraph (a) of this section also should be used to determine the amounts of firm power subject to withdrawal at 5-year intervals after the effective date of the extension to existing customers, except that the percentage used would be up to 1 percent for each of the two withdrawal opportunities, and the formula would use the customer CROD, project CROD and the resource under contract at the time.

      § 905.34   Adjustment provisions.

#### § § 905.34

      Western reserves the right to adjust marketable resources committed to all customers with long-term firm power contracts only as required to respond to changes in hydrology and river operations, except as otherwise expressly provided in these regulations. Under contracts that extend resources under this PMI, existing customers shall be given at least 5 years' notice before adjustments are made. New customers may receive less notice. The earliest that any notice under this section shall become effective is the date that existing contractual commitments expire. Any adjustment shall only take place after an appropriate public process. Withdrawals to serve project use and other purposes provided for by contract shall continue to take place based on existing contract/marketing criteria principles.

      § 905.35   New customer eligibility.

#### § § 905.35

      (a) Allocations to new customers from the project-specific resource pools established under § 905.32 shall be determined through separate public processes in each project's marketing area. New customers receiving an allocation must execute a long-term firm power contract to receive the allocated power and are required to comply with the IRP requirements in this part. Contracts with new customers shall expire on the same date as firm power contracts with all other customers of a project.

      (b) To be eligible for an allocation, a potential new customer must be a preference entity, as defined in Reclamation law, within the currently established marketing area for a project.

      (c) Entities that desire to purchase power from Western for resale to consumers, including municipalities, cooperatives, public utility districts and public power districts, must have utility status. Native American tribes are not subject to this requirement. Utility status means that the entity has responsibility to meet load growth, has a distribution system, and is ready, willing, and able to purchase power from Western on a wholesale basis for resale to retail consumers. To be eligible to apply for power available from a project's initial resource pool, those entities that desire to purchase Western power for resale to consumers must have attained utility status by December 31, 1996, for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division, and by September 30, 2000, for the Loveland Area Projects. To be eligible to apply for power from subsequent resource pool increments, these entities must have attained utility status no later than 3 years prior to availability of the incremental addition to the resource pool. Deadlines for attaining utility status for other projects will be established at a later date.

      § 905.36   Marketing criteria.

#### § § 905.36

      Western shall retain applicable provisions of existing marketing criteria for projects where resource commitments are extended beyond the current expiration date of long-term firm power sales contracts. Western must retain important marketing plan provisions such as classes of service, marketing area, and points of delivery, to the extent that these provisions are consistent with the PMI. The PMI, eligibility and allocation criteria for potential new customers, retained or amended provisions of existing marketing criteria, the project-specific resource definition, and the size of a project-specific resource pool shall constitute the future marketing plan for each project.

      § 905.37   Process.

#### § § 905.37

      Modified contractual language shall be required to place resource extensions under contract. Resource extensions and allocations to new customers from the initial resource pool will take effect when existing contracts expire. These dates are December 31, 2000, for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division and September 30, 2004, for the Loveland Area Projects. For the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division, Western will offer contracts to existing customers for resource extensions no sooner than the effective date of the final regulations. For the Loveland Area Projects, existing contracts provide for potential adjustments to marketable resources in 1999. No contracts will be offered to existing customers for post-2004 Loveland Area Projects resources until the analysis of potential resource adjustments in 1999 has been completed and any adjustments are implemented. Existing power sales contracts require that this analysis be completed by 1996.

    Subpart D—Energy Services

      § 905.40   Technical assistance.

#### § § 905.40

      Western shall establish a program that provides technical assistance to customers to conduct integrated resource planning, implement applicable IRPs and small customer plans, and otherwise comply with the requirements of these regulations.

    Subpart E—Final Principles of Integrated Resource Planning for Western Resource Acquisition

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 56481, Sept. 22, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.50   Resource acquisition principles.

#### § § 905.50

      Western's resource acquisition activities will be determined by project-specific power marketing plans, hydropower production capability, and the application of the following principles of IRP:

      (a) Western will consider a full range of resource options, both supply-side and demand-side, as well as renewable resource options.

      (b) On a project-by-project basis, Western, through a public process involving interested stakeholders will develop criteria to be used in evaluating power resource alternatives.

      (c) Evaluation criteria will address cost, environmental impact, dependability, dispatchability, risk, diversity, and the ability to verify demand-side alternatives. Evaluation criteria will be reviewed as the need for resources changes or when long-term commitments to purchase power expire.

      (d) Evaluation criteria will be consistent with Western's power marketing policy, which states that Federal power is to be marketed in such a manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles. The policy, found in Delegation Order No. 00-037.00A, is derived from statutes authorizing the sale of power from both Department of the Army and Department of the Interior hydroelectric projects. These statutes include section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825(s) and section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.

      (e) Resource acquisition planning will be consistent with power marketing plans and associated contractual obligations.

      (f) Resource acquisition decisions will be documented and made available to Western's power customers and the public.

      § 905.51   Transmission planning principles.

#### § § 905.51

      Western's transmission planning is conducted to assess the capability of the Federal transmission system to provide adequate and reliable electric service to its customers and the interconnected power grid. These planning efforts occur as part of its participation in regional and sub-regional planning entities as well as Western's Open Access Transmission Tariff.

      (c) The Program Administrator shall enter into a Conditional Agreement with a sponsor upon a determination by the Department that the sponsor is eligible for a Conditional Agreement, the information provided by the sponsor under paragraph (b) of this section is accurate and complete, and the Conditional Agreement is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

      § 950.11   Terms and conditions of the Conditional Agreement.

#### § § 950.11

      (a)  Each Conditional Agreement shall include a provision specifying that the Program Administrator and the sponsor will enter into a Standby Support Contract provided that the sponsor is one of the first six sponsors to fulfill the conditions precedent specified in § 950.12, subject to certain funding requirements and limitations specified in § 950.12 and any other applicable contractual, statutory and regulatory requirements.

      (b)  Each Conditional Agreement shall include a provision specifying the amount of coverage to be allocated under the Standby Support Contract to cover principal or interest costs and to cover incremental costs, including a provision on whether the allocation shall be different if the advanced nuclear facility is one of the initial two reactors or one of the subsequent four reactors, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. A sponsor may elect to allocate 100 percent of the coverage to either the Program Account or the Grant Account.

      (c)  Each Conditional Agreement shall contain a provision that the Program Account or Grant Account shall be funded in advance of execution of the Standby Support Contract and in the following manner, subject to the conditions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. Under no circumstances will the amount of the coverage for payments of principal or interest under a Standby Support Contract exceed 80 percent of the total of the financing guaranteed under that Contract.

      (1) The Program Account shall receive funds appropriated to the Department, loan guarantee fees, or a combination of appropriated funds and loan guarantee fees that are in an amount equal to the loan costs associated with the amount of principal or interest covered by the available indemnification. Loan costs may not be paid from the proceeds of debt guaranteed or funded by the Federal government. The parties shall specify in the Conditional Agreement the anticipated amount or anticipated percentage of the total funding in the Program Account to be contributed by appropriated funds to the Department, by the sponsor, by a non-federal source, or by a combination of these funding sources. Covered costs paid through the Program Account are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

      (2) The Grant Account shall receive funds appropriated to the Department, funds from a sponsor, funds from a non-Federal source, or a combination of appropriated funds and funds from the sponsor or other non-Federal source, in an amount equal to the incremental costs. The parties shall specify in the Conditional Agreement the anticipated amount or anticipated percentage of the total funding in the Grant Account to be contributed by appropriated funds to the Department, by the sponsor, by a non-Federal source, or by a combination of these funding sources.

      (d)  Each Conditional Agreement shall include a provision that the sponsor shall provide no later than ninety (90) days prior to execution of a Standby Support Contract sufficient information for the Program Administrator to recalculate the loan costs and the incremental costs associated with the advanced nuclear facility, taking into account whether the sponsor's advanced nuclear facility is one of the initial two reactors or the subsequent four reactors.

      (e)  Each Conditional Agreement shall contain a provision that limits the Department's contribution of Federal funding to the Program Account or the Grant Account to only those amounts, if any, that are appropriated to the Department in advance of the Standby Support Contract for the purpose of funding the Program Account or Grant Account. In the event the amount of appropriated funds to the Department for deposit in the Program Account or Grant Account is not sufficient to result in an amount equal to the full amount of the loan costs or incremental costs resulting from the allocation of coverage under the Conditional Agreement pursuant to 950.11(b), the sponsor shall no later than sixty (60) days prior to execution of the Standby Support Contract:

      (1) Notify the Department that it shall not execute a Standby Support Contract; or

      (2) Notify the Department that it shall provide the anticipated contributions to the Program Account or Grant Account as specified in the Conditional Agreement pursuant to 950.11(c)(1). The sponsor shall have the option to provide additional funds to the Program Account or Grant Account up to the amount equal to the full amount of loan costs or incremental costs. In the event the sponsor does not provide sufficient additional funds to fund the Program Account or the Grant Account in an amount equal to the full amount of loan costs or incremental costs, then the amounts of coverage available under the Standby Support Contract shall be reduced to reflect the amounts deposited in the Program Account or Grant Account. If the sponsor elects less than the full amount of coverage available under the law, then the sponsor shall not have recourse against, and the Department is not liable for, any claims for an amount of covered costs in excess of that reduced amount of coverage or the amount deposited in the Grant Account upon execution of the Standby Support Contract, notwithstanding any other provision of law.

      (f)  Each Conditional Agreement shall include a provision that the Conditional Agreement remains in effect until such time as:

      (1) The sponsor enters into a Standby Support Contract with the Program Administrator;

      (2) The sponsor has commenced construction on an advanced nuclear facility and has not entered into a Standby Support Contract with the Program Administrator within thirty (30) days after commencement of construction;

      (3) The sponsor notifies the Program Administrator in writing that it wishes to terminate the Conditional Agreement, thereby extinguishing any rights or obligations it may have under the Conditional Agreement;

      (4) The Program Administrator has entered into Standby Support Contracts that cover three different reactor designs, and the Conditional Agreement is for an advanced nuclear facility of a different reactor design than those covered under existing Standby Support Contracts; or

      (5) The Program Administrator has entered into six Standby Support Contracts.

      § 950.12   Standby Support Contract Conditions.

#### § § 950.12

      (a)  If Program Administrator has not entered into six Standby Support Contracts, the Program Administrator shall enter into a Standby Support Contract with the sponsor, consistent with applicable statutes and regulations and subject to the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, upon a determination by the Department that all the conditions precedent to a Standby Support Contract have been fulfilled, including that the sponsor has:

      (6) Paid any required fees into the Program Account and the Grant Account, as set forth in the Conditional Agreement and paragraph (b) of this section;

      (7) Provided to the Program Administrator, no later than ninety (90) days prior to execution of the contract, the sponsor's detailed schedule for completing the inspections, tests, analyses and acceptance criteria in the combined license and informing the Commission that the acceptance criteria have been met; and the sponsor's proposed schedule for review of such inspections, tests, analyses and acceptance criteria by the Commission, consistent with § 950.14(a) of this part and which the Department will evaluate and approve; and

      (8) Provided to the Program Administrator, no later than ninety (90) days prior to execution of the contract, a detailed systems-level construction schedule that includes a schedule identifying projected dates of construction, testing and full power operation of the advanced nuclear facility.

      (9) Provided to the Program Administrator, no later than ninety (90) days prior to the execution of the contract, a detailed and up-to-date plan of financing for the project including the credit structure and all sources and uses of funds for the project, and the projected cash flows for all debt obligations of the advanced nuclear facility.

      (b)  No later than thirty (30) days prior to execution of the contract, and consistent with section 638(b)(2)(C), funds in amounts determined pursuant to § 950.11(e) have been made available and shall be deposited in the Program Account or the Grant Account respectively.

      (c)  The Department shall not enter into a Standby Support Contract, if:

      (1)  The contract provides coverage of principal or interest costs for which the loan costs exceed the amount of funds deposited in the Program Account; or

      (2)  The contract provides coverage of incremental costs that exceed the amount of funds deposited in the _Grant Account._

      (d)  (1) If the Program Administrator cancels a Standby Support Contract for abandonment pursuant to 950.13(f)(1), the Program Administrator may re-execute a Standby Support Contract with a sponsor other than a sponsor or that sponsor's assignee with whom the Department had a cancelled contract, provided that such replacement Standby Support Contract is executed in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this part, and shall be deemed to be one of the subsequent four reactors under this part.

      (2) Not more than two Standby Support Contracts may be re-executed in situations involving abandonment and cancellation by the Program Administrator.

      § 950.13   Standby Support Contract: General provisions.

#### § § 950.13

      (a)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision setting forth an agreement between the parties in which the Department shall provide compensation for covered costs incurred by a sponsor for covered events that result in a covered delay of full power operation of an advanced nuclear facility.

      (b)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision of coverage only for an advanced nuclear facility which is not a federal entity.

      (c)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision to specify the amount that a sponsor has contributed to funding each type of account.

      (d)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision to specify that the Program Administrator shall not pay compensation under the contract:

      (1) In an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of coverage up to $500 million each for the initial two reactors or up to $250 million each for the subsequent four reactors;

      (2) In an amount for principal or interest costs for which the loan costs exceed the amount deposited in the Program Account; and

      (3) In an amount for incremental costs that exceed the amount deposited in the Grant Account.

      (e)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision to specify the date at which the contract commences as well as the term of the contract. The contract shall enter into force on the date it has been signed by both the sponsor and the Program Administrator. Subject to the cancellation provisions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, the contract shall terminate when all claims have been paid up to the full amounts to be covered under the Standby Support Contract, or all disputes involving claims under the contract have been resolved in accordance with subpart D of this part.

      (f)  Each Standby Support Contract shall provide for cancellation in the following circumstances:

      (1) If the sponsor abandons construction, and the abandonment is not caused by a covered event or force majeure, the Program Administrator may cancel the Standby Support Contract by giving written notice thereof to the sponsor and the parties have no further rights or obligations under the contract.

      (2) If the sponsor does not require continuing coverage under the contract, the sponsor may cancel the Standby Support Contract by giving written notice thereof to the Program Administrator and the parties have no further rights or obligations under the contract.

      (3) For such other cause as agreed to by the parties.

      (g)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision that prohibits a sponsor or any related party from executing another Standby Support Contract, if the sponsor elects to terminate its original existing Standby Support Contract, unless the sponsor has cancelled or terminated construction of the reactor covered by its original existing Standby Support Contract.

      (h)  Each Standby Support Contract shall include a provision on assignment of a sponsor's rights and obligations under the contract and assignment of payment of covered costs.

      § 950.20   General provisions.

#### § § 950.20

      The parties shall include provisions in the Standby Support Contract to specify the procedures and conditions set forth in this subpart for the submission of claims and the payment of covered costs under the Standby Support Contract. A sponsor is required to establish that there is a covered event, a covered delay and a covered cost; the Department is required to establish an exclusion in accordance with § 950.14(b).

      § 950.21   Notification of covered event.

#### § § 950.21

      (a) A sponsor shall submit in writing to the Claims Administrator a notification that a covered event has occurred that has delayed the schedule for construction or testing and that may cause covered delay. The sponsor shall submit the notification to the Claims Administrator no later than thirty (30) days of the end of the covered event and contain the following information:

      (1) A description and explanation of the covered event, including supporting documentation of the event;

      (2) The duration of the delay in the schedule for construction, testing and full power operation, and the schedule for inspections, tests, analyses and acceptance criteria, if applicable;

      (3) The sponsor's projection of the duration of covered delay;

      (4) A revised schedule for construction, testing and full power operation, including the dates of system level construction or testing that had been conducted prior to the event; and

      (5) A revised inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria schedule, if applicable, including the dates of Commission review of inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria that had been conducted prior to the event.

      (b) An authorized representative of the sponsor shall sign the notification of a covered event, certify the notification is made in good faith and the covered event is not an exclusion as specified in § 950.14(b), and represent that the supporting information is accurate and complete to the sponsor's knowledge and belief.

      § 950.22   Covered event determination.

#### § § 950.22

      (a)  Upon notification of a covered event from the sponsor, the Claims Administrator shall review the notification for completeness within thirty (30) days of receipt. If the notification is not complete, the Claims Administrator shall return the notification within thirty (30) days of receipt and specify the incomplete information for submission by the sponsor to the Claims Administrator in time for a determination by the Claims Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (b)  The Claims Administrator shall review the notification and supporting information to determine whether there is agreement by the Claims Administrator with the sponsor's representation of the event as a covered event (Covered Event Determination) based on a review of the contract conditions for covered events and exclusions.

      (1) If the Claims Administrator believes the event is an exclusion as set forth in § 950.14(b), the Claims Administrator shall request within 30 days of receipt of the notification of a covered event information in the sponsor's possession that is relevant to the exclusion. The sponsor shall provide the requested information to the Administrator within 20 days of receipt of the Administrator's request.

      (2) The sponsor's failure to provide the requested information in a complete or timely manner constitutes a basis for the Claims Administrator to disagree with the sponsor's covered event notification as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and to deny a claim for covered costs related to the exclusion as provided in § 950.24 of this part.

      (c)  The Claims Administrator shall notify the sponsor within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notification whether the Administrator agrees with the sponsor's representation, disagrees with the representation, requires further information, or is an exclusion.

The sponsor shall file a Certification of Covered Costs and thereafter such Supplementary Certifications of Covered Costs as may be necessary to receive payment under the Standby Support Contract for covered costs.

      (b)  The Certification of Covered Costs shall include the following:

      (1) A Claim Report, including the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section;

      (2) A certification by the sponsor that:

      (i) The covered costs listed on the Claim Report filed pursuant to this section are losses to be incurred by the sponsor;

      (ii) The claims for the covered costs were processed in accordance with appropriate business practices and the procedures specified in this subpart; and

      (iii) The sponsor has used due diligence to mitigate, shorten, and end, the covered delay and associated costs covered by the Standby Support Contract.

      (c)  For purposes of this part, a “Claim Report” is a report of information about a sponsor's underlying claims that, in the aggregate, constitute the sponsor's covered costs. The Claim Report shall include, but is not limited to:

      (1) Detailed information substantiating the duration of the covered delay;

      (2) Detailed information about the covered costs associated with covered delay, including as applicable:

      (i) The amount of payment for principal or interest during the covered delay, including the relevant dates of payment, amounts of payment and any other information deemed relevant by the Department, and the name of the holder of the debt, if the debt obligation is held by a Federal agency; or

      (ii) The underlying payment during the covered delay related to the incremental cost of purchasing power to meet contractual agreements, including any documentation deemed relevant by the Department to calculate the fair market price of power.

      (d)  If the total amount of the covered costs due to a sponsor under the Standby Support Contract has not been determined at the time the Certification of Covered Costs has been filed, the sponsor shall file monthly, or on a schedule otherwise determined by the Claims Administrator, Supplementary Certifications of Covered Costs updating the amount of the covered costs owed to the sponsor. Supplementary Certifications of Covered Costs shall include a Claim Report and a certification as described in this section.

      (e)  In addition to the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Claims Administrator may request such additional supporting documentation as required to ascertain the allowable covered costs sustained by a sponsor.

      § 950.24   Claims determination for covered costs.

#### § § 950.24

      (a) No later than thirty (30) days from the sponsor's submission of a Certification of Covered Costs, the Claims Administrator shall issue a Claim Determination identifying those claimed costs deemed to be allowable based on an evaluation of:

      (1) The duration of covered delay, taking into account contributory or concurrent delays resulting from exclusions from coverage as established by the Claims Administrator in accordance with § 950.22;

      (2) The covered costs associated with covered delay, including an assessment of the sponsor's due diligence in mitigating or ending covered costs, as set forth in § 950.23;

      (3) Any adjustments to the covered costs, as set forth in § 950.26; and

      (4) Other information as necessary and appropriate.

      (b) The Claim Determination shall state the Claims Administrator's determination that the claim shall be paid in full, paid in an adjusted amount as deemed allowable by the Claims Administrator, or rejected in full.

      (c) Should the Claims Administrator conclude that the sponsor has not supplied the required information in the Certification of Covered Costs or any supporting documentation sufficient to allow reasonable verification of the duration of the covered delay or covered costs, the Claims Administrator shall so inform the sponsor and specify the nature of additional documentation requested, in time for the sponsor to supply supplemental documentation and for the Claims Administrator to issue the Claim Determination.

      (d) Should the Claims Administrator find that any claimed covered costs are not allowable or otherwise should be considered excluded costs under the Standby Support Contract, the Claims Administrator shall identify such costs and state the reason(s) for that decision in writing. A determination by the Claims Administrator that an event is an exclusion or that the sponsor has not provided complete or timely information relevant to the exclusion as specified in § 950.22 shall provide a basis for the Claims Administrator to find covered costs are not allowable. If the parties cannot agree on the covered costs, they shall resolve the dispute in accordance with the requirements in subpart D of this part.

      § 950.25   Calculation of covered costs.

#### § § 950.25

      (a) The Claims Administrator shall calculate the allowable amount of the covered costs claimed in the Certification of Covered Costs as follows:

      (1)  The principal or interest on any debt obligation financing the advanced nuclear facility for the duration of covered delay to the extent the debt obligation was included in the calculation of the loan cost; and

      (2)  The incremental costs calculated for the duration of the covered delay. In calculating the incremental cost of power, the Claims Administrator shall consider:

      (i)  The fair market price may be determined by the lower of the two options: The actual cost of the short-term supply contract for replacement power, purchased by the sponsor, during the period of delay, or for each day of replacement power by its day-ahead weighted average index price in $/MWh at the hub geographically nearest to the advanced nuclear facility as posted on the previous day by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) or an alternate electronic marketplace deemed reliable by the Department. The daily MWh assumed to be covered is no more than its nameplate capacity multiplied by 24 hours; multiplied by the capacity-weighted U.S. average capacity factor in the previous calendar year, including in the calculation any and all commercial nuclear power units that operated in the United States for any part of the previous calendar year; and multiplied by the average of the ratios of the net generation to the grid for calculating payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund to the nameplate capacity for each nuclear unit included. In addition, the Claims Administrator may consider “fair market price” from other published indices or prices at regional trading hubs and bilateral contracts for similar delivered firm power products and the costs incurred, including acquisition costs, to move the power to the contract-specified point of delivery, as well as the provisions of the covered contract regarding replacement power costs for delivery default; and

      (ii)  The contractual price of power shall be determined as the daily weighted average price in equivalent $/MWh under a contractual supply agreement(s) for delivery of firm power that the sponsor entered into prior to any covered event. The daily MWh assumed to be covered is no more than the advanced nuclear facility's nameplate capacity multiplied by 24 hours; multiplied by the capacity-weighted U.S. average capacity factor in the previous calendar year, including in the calculation any and all commercial nuclear power units that operated in the United States for any part of the previous calendar year; and multiplied by the average of the ratios of the net generation to the grid for calculating payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund to the nameplate capacity for each nuclear unit included.

      § 950.26   Adjustments to claim for payment of covered costs.

#### § § 950.26

      (a)  The sponsor's aggregate amount of covered costs shall be reduced by any amounts that are determined to be either excluded or not covered.

      (b)  The Department share of covered costs shall be adjusted as follows:

      (1)  The share of covered costs paid by the Department to a sponsor shall not be greater than the limitations set forth in § 950.27(d).

      (2)  The share of covered costs paid by the Department shall be reduced by the appropriate amount consistent with the following:

      (i)  The Department shall ensure that no payment shall be made for costs resulting from events that are not covered under the contract as specified in § 950.14; and

      (ii)  Each sponsor shall ensure and demonstrate that it uses due diligence to mitigate, shorten, and to end the covered delay and associated costs covered by the Standby Support Contract.

      § 950.27   Conditions for payment of covered costs.

#### § § 950.27

      (a)  The Department shall pay the covered costs associated with a Standby Support Contract in accordance with the Claim Determination issued by the Claims Administrator under § 950.24 or the Final Claim Determination under § 950.34, provided that:

      (1) Neither the sponsor's claim for covered costs nor any other document submitted to support the underlying claim is fraudulent, collusive, made in bad faith, dishonest or otherwise designed to circumvent the purposes of the Act and regulations;

      (2) The losses submitted for payment are within the scope of coverage issued by the Department under the terms and conditions of the Standby Support Contract as specified in subpart B of this part; and

      (3) The procedures specified in this subpart have been followed and all conditions for payment have been met.

      (b)  In the event of fraud or miscalculation, the Department may subsequently adjust, including an adjustment obligating the sponsor to repay any payment made under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c)  If the Department paid or is paying covered costs under paragraph (a) of this section, and subsequently makes a determination that a sponsor has failed to meet any of the requirements for payment specified in paragraph (a) of this section for a particular covered cost, the Department may suspend payment of covered costs pending investigation and audit of the sponsor's covered costs.

      (d)  The Department's share of compensation for the initial two reactors is 100 percent of the covered costs of covered delay but not more than the coverage in the contract or $500 million per contract, whichever is less; and for the subsequent four reactors, not more than 50 percent of the covered costs of the covered delay but not more than the coverage in the contract or $250 million per contract, whichever is less. The Department's share of compensation for the subsequent four reactors is further limited in that the payment is for covered costs of a covered delay that occurs after the initial 180-day period of covered delay.

      § 950.28   Payment of covered costs.

#### § § 950.28

      (a)  The Department shall pay to a sponsor covered costs in accordance with this subpart and the terms of the Standby Support Contract. Payment shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as the Department determines appropriate. Any overpayments by the Department of the covered costs shall be offset from future payments to the sponsor or returned by the sponsor to the Department within forty-five (45) days. If there is a dispute, then the Department shall pay the undisputed costs and defer payment of the disputed portion upon resolution of the dispute in accordance with the procedures in subpart D of this part. If the covered costs include principal or interest owed on a loan made or guaranteed by a Federal agency, the Department shall instead pay that Federal agency the covered costs, rather than the sponsor.

      (b)  The sponsor may receive payment of covered costs when:

      (1) The Department has approved payment of the covered cost as specified in this subpart; and

      (2) The sponsor has incurred and is obligated to pay the costs for which payment is requested.

      (c)  The covered costs shall be paid to the sponsor designated on the Certification of Covered Costs required by § 950.23, or to the sponsor's assignee as permitted by § 950.13(h). A sponsor that requests payment of the covered costs must receive payment through electronic funds transfer.

    Subpart B—Implementation Guidelines

      § 960.3   Implementation guidelines.

#### § § 960.3

      The guidelines of this subpart establish the procedure and basis for applying the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines of subparts C and D, respectively, to evaluations of the suitability of sites. As may be appropriate during the siting process, this procedure requires consideration of a variety of geohydrologic settings and rock types, regionality, and environmental impacts and consultation with affected States, affected Indian tribes, and Federal agencies.

> [49 FR 47752, Dec. 6, 1984, as amended at 66 FR 57334, Nov. 14, 2001]

      § 960.3-1   Siting provisions.

#### § § 960.3-1

      The siting provisions establish the framework for the implementation of the siting process specified in § 960.3-2. Sections 960.3-1-1 and 960.3-1-2 require that consideration be given to sites situated in different geohydrologic settings and different types of host rock, respectively. These diversity guidelines are intended to balance the process of site selection by requiring consideration of a variety of geologic conditions and media, and thereby enhance confidence in the technical suitability of sites selected for the development of repositories. As required by the Act, § 960.3-1-3 specifies consideration of a regional distribution of repositories after recommendation of a site for development of the first repository. Section 960.3-1-4 describes the evidence that is required to support siting decisions. Section 960.3-1-5 establishes the basis for site evaluations against the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines of subparts C and D during the various phases of the siting process.

      § 960.3-1-1   Diversity of geohydrologic settings.

#### § § 960.3-1-1

      Consideration shall be given to a variety of geohydrologic settings in which sites for the development of repositories may be located. To the extent practicable, sites recommended as candidate sites for characterization shall be located in different geohydrologic settings.

      § 960.3-1-2   Diversity of rock types.

#### § § 960.3-1-2

      Consideration shall be given to a variety of geologic media in which sites for the development of repositories may be located. To the extent practicable, and with due consideration of candidate sites characterized previously or approved for such characterization if the circumstances apply, sites recommended as candidate sites for characterization shall have different types of host rock.

      § 960.3-1-3   Regionality.

#### § § 960.3-1-3

      In making site recommendations for repository development after the site for the first repository has been recommended, the Secretary shall give due consideration to the need for, and the advantages of, a regional distribution in the siting of subsequent repositories. Such consideration shall take into account the proximity of sites to locations at which waste is generated or temporarily stored and at which other repositories have been or are being developed.

      § 960.3-1-4   Evidence for siting decisions.

#### § § 960.3-1-4

      The siting process involves a sequence of four decisions: The identification of potentially acceptable sites; the nomination of sites as suitable for characterization; the recommendation of sites as candidate sites for site characterization; and after the completion of site characterization and nongeologic data gathering, the recommendation of a candidate site for the development of a repository. Each of these decisions will be supported by the evidence specified below.

      § 960.3-1-4-1   Site identification as potentially acceptable.

#### § § 960.3-1-4-1

      The evidence for the identification of a potentially acceptable site shall be the types of information specified in appendix IV of this part. Such evidence will be relatively general and less detailed than that required for the nomination of a site as suitable for characterization. Because the gathering of detailed geologic data will not take place until after the recommendation of a site for characterization, the levels of information may be relatively greater for the evaluation of those guidelines in subparts C and D that pertain to surface-identifiable factors for such site. The sources of information shall include the literature in the public domain and the private sector, when available, and will be supplemented in some instances by surface investigations and conceptual engineering design studies conducted by the DOE. Geologic surface investigations may include the mapping of identifiable rock masses, fracture and joint characteristics, and fault zones. Other surface investigations will consider the aquatic and terrestrial ecology; water rights and uses; topography; potential offsite hazards; natural resource concentrations; national or State protected resources; existing transportation systems; meteorology and climatology; population densities, centers, and distributions; and general socioeconomic characteristics.

      § 960.3-1-4-2   Site nomination for characterization.

#### § § 960.3-1-4-2

      The evidence required to support the nomination of a site as suitable for characterization shall include the types of information specified in appendix IV of this part and shall be contained or referenced in the environmental assessments to be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The source of this information shall include the literature and related studies in the public domain and the private sector, when available, and various meteorological, environmental, socioeconomic, and transportation studies conducted by the DOE in the affected area; exploratory boreholes in the region of such site, including lithologic logging and hydrologic and geophysical testing of such boreholes, laboratory testing of core samples for the evaluation of geochemical and engineering rock properties, and chemical analyses of water samples from such boreholes; surface investigations, including geologic mapping and geophysical surveys, and compilations of satellite imagery data; in situ or laboratory testing of similar rock types under expected repository conditions; evaluations of natural and man-made analogs of the repository and its subsystems, such as geothermally active areas, underground excavations, and case histories of socioeconomic cycles in areas that have experienced intermittent large-scale construction and industrial activities; and extrapolations of regional data to estimate site-specific characteristics and conditions. The exact types and amounts of information to be collected within the above categories, including such details as the specific types of hydrologic tests, combinations of geophysical tests, or number of exploratory boreholes, are dependent on the site-specific needs for the application of the guidelines of subparts C and D, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part. The evidence shall also include those technical evaluations that use the information specified above and that provide additional bases for evaluating the ability of a site to meet the qualifying conditions of the guidelines of subparts C and D. In developing the above-mentioned bases for evaluation, as may be necessary, assumptions that approximate the characteristics or conditions considered to exist at a site, or expected to exist or occur in the future, may be used. These assumptions will be realistic but conservative enough to underestimate the potential for a site to meet the qualifying condition of a guideline; that is, the use of such assumptions should not lead to an exaggeration of the ability of a site to meet the qualifying condition.

      § 960.3-1-4-3   Site recommendation for characterization.

#### § § 960.3-1-4-3

      The evidence required to support the recommendation of a site as a candidate site for characterization shall consist of the evaluations and data contained or referenced in the environmental assessment for such site, unless the Secretary certifies that such information, in the absence of additional preliminary borings or excavations, will not be adequate to satisfy applicable requirements of the Act.

      § 960.3-1-5   Basis for site evaluations.

#### § § 960.3-1-5

      (a) Evaluations of individual sites and comparisons between and among sites shall be based on the postclosure and preclosure guidelines specified in subparts C and D of this part, respectively. Except for screening for potentially acceptable sites as specified in § 960.3-2-1, such evaluations shall place primary significance on the postclosure guidelines and secondary significance on the preclosure guidelines, with each set of guidelines considered collectively for such purposes. Both the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines consist of a system guideline or guidelines and corresponding groups of technical guidelines.

      (b) The postclosure guidelines of subpart C of this part contain eight technical guidelines in one group. The preclosure guidelines of subpart D of this part contain eleven technical guidelines separated into three groups that represent, in decreasing order of importance, preclosure radiological safety; environment, socioeconomics, and transportation; and ease and cost of siting, construction, operation, and closure.

      (c) The relative significance of any technical guideline to its corresponding system guideline is site specific. Therefore, for each technical guideline, an evaluation of compliance with the qualifying condition shall be made in the context of the collection of system elements and the evidence related to that guideline, considering on balance the favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions identified at a site. Similarly, for each system guideline, such evaluation shall be made in the context of the group of technical guidelines and the evidence related to that system guideline.

      (d) For purposes of recommending sites for development as repositories, such evidence shall include analyses of expected repository performance to assess the likelihood of demonstrating compliance with 40 CFR part 191 and 10 CFR part 60, in accordance with § 960.4-1. A site shall be disqualified at any time during the siting process if the evidence supports a finding by the DOE that a disqualifying condition exists or the qualifying condition of any system or technical guideline cannot be met.

      (e) Comparisons between and among sites shall be based on the system guidelines, to the extent practicable and in accordance with the levels of relative significance specified above for the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines. Such comparisons are intended to allow comparative evaluations of sites in terms of the capabilities of the natural barriers for waste isolation and to identify innate deficiencies that could jeopardize compliance with such requirements. If the evidence for the sites is not adequate to substantiate such comparisons, then the comparisons shall be based on the groups of technical guidelines under the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines, considering the levels of relative significance appropriate to the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines and the order of importance appropriate to the subordinate groups within the preclosure guidelines. Comparative site evaluations shall place primary importance on the natural barriers of the site. In such evaluations for the postclosure guidelines of subpart C of this part, engineered barriers shall be considered only to the extent necessary to obtain realistic source terms for comparative site evaluations based on the sensitivity of the natural barriers to such realistic engineered barriers. For a better understanding of the potential effects of engineered barriers on the overall performance of the repository system, these comparative evaluations shall consider a range of levels in the performance of the engineered barriers. That range of performance levels shall vary by at least a factor of 10 above and below the engineered-barrier performance requirements set forth in 10 CFR 60.113, and the range considered shall be identical for all sites compared. The comparisons shall assume equivalent engineered barrier performance for all sites compared and shall be structured so that engineered barriers are not relied upon to compensate for deficiencies in the geologic media. Furthermore, engineered barriers shall not be used to compensate for an inadequate site; mask the innate deficiencies of a site; disguise the strengths and weaknesses of a site and the overall system; and mask differences between sites when they are compared. Releases of different radionuclides shall be combined by the methods specified in appendix A of 40 CFR part 191.

      (f) The comparisons specified in paragraph (e) of this section shall consist of two comparative evaluations that predict radionuclide releases for 100,000 years after repository closure and shall be conducted as follows. First, the sites shall be compared by means of evaluations that emphasize the performance of the natural barriers at the site. Second, the sites shall be compared by means of evaluations that emphasize the performance of the total repository system. These second evaluations shall consider the expected performance of the repository system; be based on the expected performance of waste packages and waste forms, in compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR 60.113, and on the expected hydrological and geochemical conditions at each site; and take credit for the expected performance of all other engineered components of the repository system. The comparison of isolation capability shall be one of the significant considerations in the recommendation of sites for the development of repositories. The first of the two comparative evaluations specified in the paragraph (e) of this section shall take precedence unless the second comparative evaluation would lead to substantially different recommendations. In the latter case, the two comparative evaluations shall receive comparable consideration. Sites with predicted isolation capabilities that differ by less than a factor of 10, with similar uncertainties, may be assumed to provide equivalent isolation.

      § 960.3-2   Siting process.

#### § § 960.3-2

      The siting process begins with site screening for the identification of potentially acceptable sites. This process was completed for purposes of the first repository before the enactment of the Act, and the identification of such sites was made after enactment in accordance with the provisions of section 116(a) of the Act. The screening process for the identification of potentially acceptable sites for the second and subsequent repositories shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements specified in § 960.3-2-1 of this subpart. The nomination of any site as suitable for characterization shall follow the process specified in § 960.3-2-2, and such nomination shall be accompanied by an environmental assessment as specified in section 112(b)(1)(E) of the Act. The recommendation of sites as candidate sites for characterization shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements specified in § 960.3-2-3.

      To identify potentially acceptable sites for the development of other than the _first_ repository, the process shall begin with site-screening activities that consider large land masses that contain rock formations of suitable depth, thickness, and lateral extent and have structural, hydrologic, and tectonic features favorable for waste containment and isolation. Within those large land masses, subsequent site-screening activities shall focus on successively smaller and increasingly more suitable land units. This process shall be developed in consultation with the States that contain land units under consideration. It shall be implemented in a sequence of steps that first applies the applicable disqualifying conditions to eliminate land units on the basis of the evidence specified in § 960.3-1-4-1 and in accordance with the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part. After the disqualifying conditions have been applied, the favorable and potentially adverse conditions, as identified for each remaining land unit, shall be evaluated. The presence of favorable conditions shall favor a given land unit, while the presence of potentially adverse conditions shall penalize that land unit. Recognizing that favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions for different technical guidelines can exist in the same land unit, the DOE shall seek to evaluate the composite favorability of each land unit. Land units that, in the aggregrate, exhibit potentially adverse conditions shall be deferred in favor of land units that exhibit favorable conditions. The siting provisions that require diversity of geohydrologic settings and rock types and consideration of regionality, as specified in §§ 960.3-1-1, 960.3-1-2, and 960.3-1-3, respectively, may be used to discriminate between land units and to establish the range of options in site screening. To identify a site as potentially acceptable, the evidence shall support a finding that the site is not disqualified in accordance with the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part and shall support the decision by the DOE to proceed the continued investigation of the site on the basis of the favorable and potentially adverse conditions identified to date. In continuation of the screening process after such identification and before site nomination, the DOE may defer from further consideration land units or potentially acceptable sites or portions thereof on the basis of additional information or by the application of the siting provisions for diversity of geohydrologic settings, diversity of rock types, and regionality (§§ 960.3-1-1, 960.3-1-2, and 960.3-1-3, respectively). The deferral of potentially acceptable sites will be described in the environmental assessments that accompany the nomination of at least five sites as suitable for characterization. In order to identify potentially acceptable sites for the second and subsequent repositories, the Secretary shall  identify the State within which the site is located in a decision-basis document that describes the process and the considerations that led to the identification of such site and that has been issued previously in draft for review and comment by such State.  when such document is final, the Secretary shall notify the Governor and the legislature of that State and the tribal council of any affected Indian tribe of the potentially acceptable site.

      § 960.3-2-2   Nomination of sites as suitable for characterization.

#### § § 960.3-2-2

      From the sites identified as potentially acceptable, the Secretary shall nominate at least five sites determined suitable for site characterization for the selection of each repository site. For the second repository, at least three of the sites shall not have been nominated previously. Any site nominated as suitable for characterization for the first repository, but not recommended as a candidate site for characterization, may not be nominated as suitable for characterization for the second repository. The nomination of a site as suitable for characterization shall be accompanied by an environmental assessment as specified in section 112(b)(1)(E) of the Act. Such nomination shall be based on evaluations in accordance with the guidelines of this part, and the bases and relevant details of those evaluations and of the decision processes involved therein shall be contained in the environmental assessment for the site in the manner specified in this subpart. The evidence required to support such evaluations and siting decisions is specified in § 960.3-1-4-2.

      § 960.3-2-2-1   Evaluation of all potentially acceptable sites.

#### § § 960.3-2-2-1

      in considering sites for nomination, each of the potentially acceptable sites shall be evaluated on the basis of the disqualifying conditions specified in the technical guidelines of subparts C and D, in accordance with the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part. This evaluation shall support a finding by the DOE that such sites is not disqualified.

      § 960.3-2-2-2   Selection of sites within geohydrologic settings.

#### § § 960.3-2-2-2

      the siting provision requiring diversity of geohydrologic settings, as specified in § 960.3-1-1, shall be applied to group all potentially acceptable sites according to their geohydrologic settings.  for those geohydrologic settings that contain more than one potentially acceptable site, the preferred site shall be selected on the basis of a comparative evaluation of all potentially acceptable sites in that setting. This evaluation shall consider the distinguishing characteristics displayed by the potentially acceptable sites within the setting and the related guidelines from subparts C and D. That is, the appropriate guidelines shall be selected primarily on the basis of the kinds of evidence among sites for which distinguishing characteristics can be identified. Such comparative evaluation shall be made on the basis of the qualifying conditions for those guidelines, considering, on balance, the favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions identified at each site. Due consideration shall also be given to the siting provisions specifying the basis for site evaluations in § 960.3-1-5, to the extent practicable, and diversity of rock types in § 960.3-1-2, if the circumstances so apply. If less than five geohydrologic settings are available for consideration, the above process shall be used to select two or more preferred sites from those settings that contain more than one potentially acceptable site, as required to obtain the number of sites to be nominated as suitable for characterization. For purposes of the second and subsequent repositories, due consideration shall also be given to the siting provision for regionality as specified in § 960.3-1-3.  each preferred site within a geohydrologic setting shall be evaluated as to whether such site is suitable for the development of a repository under the qualifying condition of each guideline specified in subparts C and D that does not require site characterization as a prerequisite for the application of such guideline. The guidelines considered appropriate to this evaluation have been selected on the basis of their exclusion under the definition of site characterization as specified in § 960.2. Although the final application of these guidelines, in accordance with the provisions set forth in appendix III of this part, does not require geologic data from site-characterization activities, such application will require additional data beyond those specified in appendix IV of this part, which will be obtained concurrently with site characterization. Such guidelines include those specified in § 960.4-2-8-2 (Site Ownership and Control) of subpart C; §§ 960.5-1(a)(1) and 960.5-1(a)(2) of subpart D (preclosure system guidelines for radiological safety and environmental quality, socioeconomics, and transportation); and §§ 960.5-2-1 through 960.5-2-7 of subpart D (Population Density and Distribution, Site Ownership and Control, Meteorology, Offsite Installations and Operations, Environmental Quality, Socioeconomic Impacts, and Transportation). This evaluation shall consider on balance those favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions identified as such at a preferred site in relation to the qualifying condition of each such guideline. For each such guideline, this evaluation shall focus on the suitability of the site for the development of a repository by considering the activities from the start of site characterization through decommissioning and shall support a finding by the DOE in accordance with the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part.  each preferred site within a geohydrologic setting shall be evaluated as to whether such site is suitable for site characterization under the qualifying conditions of those guidelines specified in subparts C and D that require characterization (i.e., subsurface geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical data gathering). Such guidelines include those specified in § 960.4-1(a) (postclosure system guideline); §§ 960.4-2-1 through 960.4-2-8-1 of subpart C (Geohydrology, Geochemistry, Rock Characteristics, Climatic Changes, Erosion, Dissolution, Tectonics, Human Interference, and Natural Resources); § 960.5-1(a)(3) (preclosure system guideline for ease and cost of siting, construction, operation, and closure); and § 960.5-2-8 through 960.5-2-11 of subpart D (Surface Characteristics, Rock Characteristics, Hydrology, and Tectonics). This evaluation shall consider on balance the favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions identified as such at a preferred site in relation to the qualifying condition of each such guideline. For each such guideline, this evaluation shall focus on the suitability of the site for characterization and shall support a finding by the DOE in accordance with the application requirements set forth in appendix III of this part.

      § 960.3-2-2-3   Comparative evaluation of all sites proposed for nomination.

#### § § 960.3-2-2-3

      for those potentially acceptable sites to be proposed for nomination, as determined by the process specified in § 960.3-2-2-2, a reasonable comparative evaluation of each such site with all other such sites shall be made. For each site and for each guideline specified in subparts C and D, the DOE shall summarize the evaluations and findings specified under § 960.3-2-2-1 and under the fourth and fifth provisions of § 960.3-2-2-2. Each such summary shall allow comparisons to be made among sites on this basis of each guideline.

      § 960.3-2-2-4   The environmental assessment.

#### § § 960.3-2-2-4

      To document the process specified above, and in compliance with section 112(b)(1)(E) of the Act, an environmental assessment shall be prepared for each site proposed for nomination as suitable for characterization. Each such environmental assessment shall describe the decision process by which such site was proposed for nomination as described in the preceding six steps and shall contain or reference the evidence that supports such process according to the requirements of § 960.3-1-4-2 and appendix IV of this part. As specified in the Act, each environmental assessment shall include an evaluation of the effects of the site-characterization activities at the site on public health and safety and the environment; a discussion of alternative activities related to site characterization that may be taken to avoid such impact; and an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating a repository at the site. The draft environmental assessment for each site proposed for nomination as suitable for characterization shall be made available by the DOE for public comment after the Secretary has notified the Governor and legislature of the State in which the site is located, and the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site is located, of such impending availability.

      § 960.3-2-2-5   Formal site nomination.

#### § § 960.3-2-2-5

      After the final environmental assessments have been prepared, the Secretary shall nominate at least five sites that he determines suitable for site characterization for the selection of a repository site, and, in so doing, he shall cause to have published in the  a notice specifying the sites so nominated and announcing the availability of the final environmental assessments for such sites. This determination by the Secretary shall be based on the final environmental assessments for such sites, including, in particular, consideration of the available evidence, evaluations, and the resultant findings for the guidelines of subparts C and D so specified under the fourth and fifth provisions of § 960.3-2-2-2. Before nominating a site, the Secretary shall notify the Governor and legislature of the State in which the site is located, and the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site is located, of such nomination and the basis for such nomination.

      § 960.3-2-3   Recommendation of sites for characterization.

#### § § 960.3-2-3

      After the nomination of at least five sites as suitable for site characterization for the selection of the first repository, the Secretary shall recommend in writing to the President not less than three candidate sites for such characterization. The recommendation decision shall be based on the available geophysical, geologic, geochemical, and hydrologic data; other information; associated evaluations and findings reported in the environmental assessments accompanying the nominations; and the considerations specified below, unless the Secretary certifies that such available data will not be adequate to satisfy applicable requirements of the Act in the absence of further preliminary borings or excavations. On the basis of the evidence and in accordance with the siting provision specifying the basis for site evaluations in § 960.3-1-5, the sites nominated as suitable for characterization shall be considered as to their order of preference as candidate sites for characterization. Subsequently, the siting provisions specifying diversity of geohydrologic settings, diversity of rock types, and, after the first repository, consideration of regionality in §§ 960.3-1-1, 960.3-1-2, and 960.3-1-3, respectively, shall be considered to determine a final order of preference for the characterization of such sites. Considering this order of preference together with the available siting alternatives specified in the Act, the sites recommended as candidate sites for characterization shall offer, on balance, the most advantageous combination of characteristics and conditions for the successful development of repositories at such sites. The process for the recommendation of sites as candidate sites for characterization for the selection of any subsequent repository shall be the same as that specified above for the first repository.

      § 960.3-3   Consultation.

#### § § 960.3-3

      The DOE shall provide to designated officials of the affected States and to the governing bodies of any affected Indian tribe timely and complete information regarding determinations or plans made with respect to the siting, site characterization, design, development, construction, operation, closure, decommissioning, licensing, or regulation of a repository. Written responses to written requests for information from the designated officials of affected States or affected Indian tribes will be provided within 30 days after receipt of the written requests. In performing any study of an area for the purpose of determining the suitability of such area for the development of a repository, the DOE shall consult and cooperate with the Governor and the legislature of an affected State and the governing body of an affected Indian tribe in an effort to resolve concerns regarding public health and safety, environmental impacts, socioeconomic impacts, and technical aspects of the siting process. After notifying affected States and affected Indian tribes that potentially acceptable sites have been identified, or that a site has been approved for characterization, the DOE shall seek to enter into binding written agreements with such affected States or affected Indian tribes in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The DOE shall also consult, as appropriate, with other Federal agencies.

      § 960.3-4   Environmental impacts.

#### § § 960.3-4

      Environmental impacts shall be considered by the DOE throughout the site characterization, site selection, and repository development process. The DOE shall mitigate significant adverse environmental impacts, to the extent practicable, during site characterization and repository construction, operation, closure, and decommissioning.

    Subpart C—Postclosure Guidelines

      § 960.4   Postclosure guidelines.

#### § § 960.4

      The guidelines in this subpart specify the factors to be considered in evaluating and comparing sites on the basis of expected repository performance after closure. The postclosure guidelines are separated into a system guideline and eight technical guidelines. The system guideline establishes waste containment and isolation requirements that are based on NRC and EPA regulations. These requirements must be met by the repository system, which contains natural barriers and engineered barriers. The engineered barriers will be designed to complement the natural barriers, which provide the primary means for waste isolation.

      § 960.4-1   System guideline.

#### § § 960.4-1

      (a)  The geologic setting at the site shall allow for the physical separation of radioactive waste from the accessible environment after closure in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 191, subpart B, as implemented by the provisions of 10 CFR part 60. The geologic setting at the site will allow for the use of engineered barriers to ensure compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 191 and 10 CFR part 60 (see appendix I of this part).

      § 960.4-2   Technical guidelines.

#### § § 960.4-2

      The technical guidelines in this subpart set forth qualifying, favorable, potentially adverse, and, in five guidelines, disqualifying conditions on the characteristics, processes, and events that may influence the performance of a repository system after closure. The favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions under each guideline are  listed in any assumed order of importance. Potentially adverse conditions will be considered if they affect waste isolation within the controlled area even though such conditions may occur outside the controlled area. The technical guidelines that follow establish conditions that shall be considered in determining compliance with the qualifying condition of the postclosure system guideline. For each technical guideline, an evaluation of qualification or disqualification shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in subpart B.

      § 960.4-2-1   Geohydrology.

#### § § 960.4-2-1

      (a)  The present and expected geohydrologic setting of a site shall be compatible with waste containment and isolation.

      (5) For disposal in the unsaturated zone, at least one of the following pre-waste-emplacement conditions exists:

      (i) A low and nearly constant degree of saturation in the host rock and in the immediately surrounding geohydrologic units.

      (ii) A water table sufficiently below the underground facility such that the fully saturated voids continuous with the water table do not encounter the host rock.

      (iii) A geohydrologic unit above the host rock that would divert the downward infiltration of water beyond the limits of the emplaced waste.

      (iv) A host rock that provides for free drainage.

      (v) A climatic regime in which the average annual historical precipitation is a small fraction of the average annual potential evapotranspiration.

      (c)  (1) Expected changes in geohydrologic conditions—such as changes in the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity, the effective porosity, and the ground-water flux through the host rock and the surrounding geohydrologic units—sufficient to significantly increase the transport of radionuclides to the accessible environment as compared with pre-waste-emplacement conditions.

      (2) The presence of ground-water sources, suitable for crop irrigation or human consumption without treatment, along ground-water flow paths from the host rock to the accessible environment.

      (3) The presence in the geologic setting of stratigraphic or structural features—such as dikes, sills, faults, shear zones, folds, dissolution effects, or brine pockets—if their presence could significantly contribute to the difficulty of characterizing or modeling the geohydrologic system.

      (d)  A site shall be disqualified if the pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel time from the disturbed zone to the accessible environment is expected to be less than 1,000 years along any pathway of likely and significant radionuclide travel.

      § 960.4-2-2   Geochemistry.

#### § § 960.4-2-2

      (a)  The present and expected geochemical characteristics of a site shall be compatible with waste containment and isolation. Considering the likely chemical interactions among radionuclides, the host rock, and the ground water, the characteristics of and the processes operating within the geologic setting shall permit compliance with (1) the requirements specified in § 960.4-1 for radionuclide releases to the accessible environment and (2) the requirements specified in 10 CFR 60.113 for radionuclide releases from the engineered-barrier system using reasonably available technology.

      (b)  (1) The nature and rates of the geochemical processes operating within the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period would, if continued into the future, not affect or would favorably affect the ability of the geologic repository to isolate the waste during the next 100,000 years.

      (3) Mineral assemblages that, when subjected to expected repository conditions, would remain unaltered or would alter to mineral assemblages with equal or increased capability to retard radionuclide transport.

      (4) A combination of expected geochemical conditions and a volumetric flow rate of water in the host rock that would allow less than 0.001 percent per year of the total radionuclide inventory in the repository at 1,000 years to be dissolved.

      (5) Any combination of geochemical and physical retardation processes that would decrease the predicted peak cumulative releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment by a factor of 10 as compared to those predicted on the basis of ground-water travel time without such retardation.

      (c)  (1) Ground-water conditions in the host rock that could affect the solubility or the chemical reactivity of the engineered-barrier system to the extent that the expected repository performance could be compromised.

      (2) Geochemical processes or conditions that could reduce the sorption of radionuclides or degrade the rock strength.

      (3) Pre-waste-emplacement ground-water conditions in the host rock that are chemically oxidizing.

      § 960.4-2-3   Rock characteristics.

#### § § 960.4-2-3

      (a)  The present and expected characteristics of the host rock and surrounding units shall be capable of accommodating the thermal, chemical, mechanical, and radiation stresses expected to be induced by repository construction, operation, and closure and by expected interactions among the waste, host rock, ground water, and engineered components. The characteristics of and the processes operating within the geologic setting shall permit compliance with (1) the requirements specified in § 960.4-1 for radionuclide releases to the accessible environment and (2) the requirements set forth in 10 CFR 60.113 for radionuclide releases from the engineered-barrier system using reasonably available technology.

      (b)  (1) A host rock that is sufficiently thick and laterally extensive to allow significant flexibility in selecting the depth, configuration, and location of the underground facility to ensure isolation.

      (2) A host rock with a high thermal conductivity, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, or sufficient ductility to seal fractures induced by repository construction, operation, or closure or by interactions among the waste, host rock, ground water, and engineered components.

      (c)  (1) Rock conditions that could require engineering measures beyond reasonably available technology for the construction, operation, and closure of the repository, if such measures are necessary to ensure waste containment or isolation.

      (2) Potential for such phenomena as thermally induced fractures, the hydration or dehydration of mineral components, brine migration, or other physical, chemical, or radiation-related phenomena that could be expected to affect waste containment or isolation.

      (3) A combination of geologic structure, geochemical and thermal properties, and hydrologic conditions in the host rock and surrounding units such that the heat generated by the waste could significantly decrease the isolation provided by the host rock as compared with pre-waste-emplacement conditions.

      § 960.4-2-4   Climatic changes.

#### § § 960.4-2-4

      (a)  The site shall be located where future climatic conditions will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1. In predicting the likely future climatic conditions at a site, the DOE will consider the global, regional, and site climatic patterns during the Quaternary Period, considering the geomorphic evidence of the climatic conditions in the geologic setting.

      (b)  (1) A surface-water system such that expected climatic cycles over the next 100,000 years would not adversely affect waste isolation.

      (2) A geologic setting in which climatic changes have had little effect on the hydrologic system throughout the Quaternary Period.

      (c)  (1) Evidence that the water table could rise sufficiently over the next 10,000 years to saturate the underground facility in a previously unsaturated host rock.

      (2) Evidence that climatic changes over the next 10,000 years could cause perturbations in the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity, the effective porosity, or the ground-water flux through the host rock and the surrounding geohydrologic units, sufficient to significantly increase the transport of radionuclides to the accessible environment.

      § 960.4-2-5   Erosion.

#### § § 960.4-2-5

      (a)  The site shall allow the underground facility to be placed at a depth such that erosional processes acting upon the surface will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1.

      (c)  (1) A geologic setting that shows evidence of extreme erosion during the Quaternary Period.

      (2) A geologic setting where the nature and rates of geomorphic processes that have been operating during the Quaternary Period could, during the first 10,000 years after closure, adversely affect the ability of the geologic repository to isolate the waste.

      (d)  The site shall be  if site conditions do not allow all portions of the underground facility to be situated at least 200 meters below the directly overlying ground surface.

      § 960.4-2-6   Dissolution.

#### § § 960.4-2-6

      (a)  The site shall be located such that any subsurface rock dissolution will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1. In predicting the likelihood of dissolution within the geologic setting at a site, the DOE will consider the evidence of dissolution within that setting during the Quaternary Period, including the locations and characteristics of dissolution fronts or other dissolution features, if identified.

      (b)  No evidence that the host rock within the site was subject to significant dissolution during the Quaternary Period.

      (c)  Evidence of dissolution within the geologic setting—such as breccia pipes, dissolution cavities, significant volumetric reduction of the host rock or surrounding strata, or any structural collapse—such that a hydraulic interconnection leading to a loss of waste isolation could occur.

      (d)  The site shall be  if it is likely that, during the first 10,000 years after closure, active dissolution, as predicted on the basis of the geologic record, would result in a loss of waste isolation.

      § 960.4-2-7   Tectonics.

#### § § 960.4-2-7

      (a)  The site shall be located in a geologic setting where future tectonic processes or events will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1. In predicting the likelihood of potentially disruptive tectonic processes or events, the DOE will consider the structural, stratigraphic, geophysical, and seismic evidence for the nature and rates of tectonic processes and events in the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period.

      (b)  The nature and rates of igneous activity and tectonic processes (such as uplift, subsidence, faulting, or folding), if any, operating within the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period would, if continued into the future, have less than one chance in 10,000 over the first 10,000 years after closure of leading to releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment.

      (c)  (1) Evidence of active folding, faulting, diapirism, uplift, subsidence, or other tectonic processes or igneous activity within the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period.

      (2) Historical earthquakes within the geologic setting of such magnitude and intensity that, if they recurred, could affect waste containment or isolation.

      (3) Indications, based on correlations of earthquakes with tectonic processes and features, that either the frequency of occurrence or the magnitude of earthquakes within the geologic setting may increase.

      (4) More-frequent occurrences of earthquakes or earthquakes of higher magnitude than are representative of the region in which the geologic setting is located.

      (5) Potential for natural phenomena such as landslides, subsidence, or volcanic activity of such magnitudes that they could create large-scale surface-water impoundments that could change the regional ground-water flow system.

      (6) Potential for tectonic deformations—such as uplift, subsidence, folding, or faulting—that could adversely affect the regional ground-water flow system.

      (d)  A site shall be disqualified if, based on the geologic record during the Quaternary Period, the nature and rates of fault movement or other ground motion are expected to be such that a loss of waste isolation is likely to occur.

      § 960.4-2-8   Human interference.

#### § § 960.4-2-8

      The site shall be located such that activities by future generations at or near the site will not be likely to affect waste containment and isolation. In assessing the likelihood of such activities, the DOE will consider the estimated effectiveness of the permanent markers and records required by 10 CFR part 60, taking into account site-specific factors, as stated in §§ 960.4-2-8-1 and 960.4-2-8-2, that could compromise their continued effectiveness.

      § 960.4-2-8-1   Natural resources.

#### § § 960.4-2-8-1

      (a)  This site shall be located such that—considering permanent markers and records and reasonable projections of value, scarcity, and technology—the natural resources, including ground water suitable for crop irrigation or human consumption without treatment, present at or near the site will not be likely to give rise to interference activities that would lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1.

      (b)  (1) No known natural resources that have or are projected to have in the foreseeable future a value great enough to be considered a commercially extractable resource.

      (2) Ground water with 10,000 parts per million or more of total dissolved solids along any path of likely radionuclide travel from the host rock to the accessible environment.

      (c)  (1) Indications that the site contains naturally occurring materials, whether or not actually identified in such form that (i) economic extraction is potentially feasible during the foreseeable future or (ii) such materials have a greater gross value, net value, or commercial potential than the average for other areas of similar size that are representative of, and located in, the geologic setting.

      (2) Evidence of subsurface mining or extraction for resources within the site if it could affect waste containment or isolation.

      (b) DOE will seek NRC concurrence on any future revisions to this subpart.

      § 963.11   Suitability determination.

#### § § 963.11

      DOE will evaluate whether the Yucca Mountain site is suitable for the location of a geologic repository on the basis of the preclosure and postclosure determinations described in §§ 963.12 and 963.15. If DOE's evaluation of the Yucca Mountain site for the location of a geologic repository under §§ 963.12 and 963.15 shows that the geologic repository is likely to meet the applicable radiation protection standards for the preclosure and postclosure periods, then DOE may determine that the site is a suitable location for the development of such a repository.

      § 963.12   Preclosure suitability determination.

#### § § 963.12

      DOE will apply the method and criteria described in §§ 963.13 and 963.14 to evaluate the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for the preclosure period. If DOE finds that the results of the preclosure safety evaluation conducted under § 963.13 show that the Yucca Mountain site is likely to meet the applicable radiation protection standard, DOE may determine the site suitable for the preclosure period.

      § 963.13   Preclosure suitability evaluation method.

#### § § 963.13

      (a) DOE will evaluate preclosure suitability using a preclosure safety evaluation method. DOE will evaluate the performance of the geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in § 963.14. DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the geologic repository is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard.

      (b) The preclosure safety evaluation method, using preliminary engineering specifications, will assess the adequacy of the repository facilities to perform their intended functions and prevent or mitigate the effects of postulated Category 1 and 2 event sequences. The preclosure safety evaluation will consider:

      (1) A preliminary description of the site characteristics, the surface facilities and the underground operating facilities;

      (2) A preliminary description of the design bases for the operating facilities and a preliminary description of any associated limits on operation;

      § 963.14   Preclosure suitability criteria.

#### § § 963.14

      DOE will evaluate preclosure suitability using the following criteria:

      (a) Ability to contain radioactive material and to limit releases of radioactive materials;

      (b) Ability to implement control and emergency systems to limit exposure to radiation;

      (c) Ability to maintain a system and components that perform their intended safety functions; and

      § 963.15   Postclosure suitability determination.

#### § § 963.15

      DOE will apply the method and criteria described in §§ 963.16 and 963.17 to evaluate the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for the postclosure period. If DOE finds that the results of the total system performance assessments conducted under § 963.16 show that the Yucca Mountain site is likely to meet the applicable radiation protection standard, DOE may determine the site suitable for the postclosure period.

      § 963.16   Postclosure suitability evaluation method.

#### § § 963.16

      (a) DOE will evaluate postclosure suitability using the total system performance assessment method. DOE will conduct a total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the geologic repository to meet the applicable radiation protection standard under the following circumstances:

      (1) DOE will conduct a total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the Yucca Mountain disposal system to limit radiological doses and radionuclide concentrations in the case where there is no human intrusion into the repository. DOE will model the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in § 963.17. DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the Yucca Mountain disposal system is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard.

      (2) DOE will conduct a separate total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the Yucca Mountain disposal system to limit radiological doses in the case where there is a human intrusion as specified by 10 CFR 63.322. DOE will model the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in § 963.17. If required by applicable NRC regulations regarding a human intrusion standard, § 63.321, DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the Yucca Mountain disposal system is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard.

      (b) In conducting a total system performance assessment under this section, DOE will:

      (1) Include data related to the suitability criteria in § 963.17;

      (2) Account for uncertainties and variabilities in parameter values and provide the technical basis for parameter ranges, probability distributions, and bounding values;

      (3) Consider alternative models of features and processes that are consistent with available data and current scientific understanding, and evaluate the effects that alternative models would have on the estimated performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system ;

      (4) Consider only events that have at least one chance in 10,000 of occurring over 10,000 years;

      (5) Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of specific features, events, and processes of the geologic setting, including appropriate details as to magnitude and timing regarding any exclusions that would significantly change the dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual;

      (6) Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers, including those processes that would adversely affect natural barriers, (such as degradation of concrete liners affecting the pH of ground water or precipitation of minerals due to heat changing hydrologic processes), including appropriate details as to magnitude and timing regarding any exclusions that would significantly change the dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual;

      (7) Provide the technical basis for models used in the total system performance assessment such as comparisons made with outputs of detailed process-level models and/or empirical observations (for example, laboratory testing, field investigations, and natural analogs);

      (8) Identify natural features of the geologic setting and design features of the engineered barrier system important to isolating radioactive waste;

      (9) Describe the capability of the natural and engineered barriers important to isolating radioactive waste, taking into account uncertainties in characterizing and modeling such barriers;

      (10) Provide the technical basis for the description of the capability of the natural and engineered barriers important to isolating radioactive waste;

      (11) Use the reference biosphere and reasonably maximally exposed individual assumptions specified in applicable NRC regulations; and

      (12) Conduct appropriate sensitivity studies.
