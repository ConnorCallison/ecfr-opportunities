**Source:** Source: 63 FR 57234, Oct. 27, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

    § 3200.1   Purpose.

#### § § 3200.1

    This Part sets forth the procedures to be utilized by Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the acquisition and transfer of excess property to the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions in support of research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or for related programs as authorized by 7 U.S.C. 2206a. Title to the personal property shall pass to the institution.

    § 3200.2   Eligibility.

#### § § 3200.2

    Institutions that are eligible to receive Federal excess personal property pursuant to the provisions of this part are the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions conducting research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or related programs.

    § 3200.3   Definitions.

#### § § 3200.3

    (a) —any college or university eligible to receive funds under the Act of August 30, 1890 (7 U.S.C. 321 et. seq.), including Tuskegee University.

    (b) —any of the tribal colleges or universities as defined in section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note).

    (c) —institutions of higher education as defined in section 316(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1059c (b)).

    (d) —is an authorized USDA or institution official responsible for property management.

    (e) —is an individual designated by an eligible institution and authorized by the General Services Administration (GSA) to visit property sites for the purpose of inspecting personal property intended for use by the institution.

    (f) —is any personal property under the control of a Federal agency that is no longer needed.

    (g) —is the dismantling of equipment for parts to repair or enhance other equipment.

    § 3200.4   Procedures.

#### § § 3200.4

    (a) To receive information concerning the availability of Federal excess personal property, an eligible institution's property management officer may contact their regional GSA, Area Utilization Officer. For information on USDA excess personal property, visit the USDA Web site at  USDA excess property will first be screened by USDA agencies through the Departmental Excess Personal Property Coordinator (DEPPC) using the Departmental Property Management Information System.

    (b) Excess property selected by screeners of eligible institutions should be inspected whenever possible, or the holding agency should be contacted to verify the condition of the items, because interpretation of condition codes varies among Federal agencies.

    (c) If the condition of the item is acceptable, the institution should “freeze” (reserve) items by calling the appropriate GSA office or USDA Departmental Excess Personal Property Coordinator (DEPPC). Since GSA may have several “freezes” on a piece of equipment, it is critical that the paperwork be submitted as soon as possible. Further, while transfers of excess personal property normally will be approved by GSA on a first-come-first-serve basis, consideration will be given to such factors as national defense requirements, emergency needs, preclusion of new procurement, energy conservation, equitable distribution, and retention of title in the Government.

    (d) Eligible institutions may submit property requests by mail or fax on a Standard Form 122, “Transfer Order Excess Personal Property”.

    (e) The SF-122 should be signed by the eligible institution's property management officer or authorized designee.

    (1) The following information should also be provided:

    (i) Date prepared.

    (ii) GSA/DEPPC address.

    (iii) Ordering Agency and address.

    (iv) Holding Agency and address.

    (v) Name and address of Institution.

    (vi) Location of property.

    (vii) Shipping instruction (including institution contact person and phone number).

    (viii) Complete description of property including original acquisition cost, serial number, condition code, and quantity.

    (2) This statement needs to be added following the property description:

    (f) The SF-122 should be forwarded to USDA for approval and signature by an authorized USDA official. As confirmation of approval, the eligible institution's property management officer will receive a stamped copy of the SF-122. If the request is disapproved, it will be returned to the property management officer of the eligible institution with an appropriate explanation. All USDA approved SF-122's will be forwarded to DEPPC or the appropriate GSA office for final approval.

    (g) Once the excess personal property is physically received, the institution is required to immediately return a copy of the SF-122 to USDA indicating receipt of requested items. Cancellations should also be reported to USDA.

    § 3200.5   Dollar limitation.

#### § § 3200.5

    There is no dollar limitation on excess personal property obtained under these procedures.

    § 3200.6   Restrictions.

#### § § 3200.6

    (a) Property in the following Federal Supply Groups are prohibited from transfer.

    (b) The property in the FSC's listed below are discouraged from transfer and not approved on a routine basis. However, Institutions may request items in these FSC groups, but all requests will be referred to the Director, Office of Procurement and Property Management for consideration and approval:

    (c) Excess personal property may be transferred for the purpose of cannibalization, provided the eligible institution submits a supporting statement which clearly indicates that cannibalizing the requested property for secondary use has greater benefit than utilization of the item in its existing form.

    (d) Use of the procedures in this part for the purpose of stockpiling of excess personal property for future cannibalization is prohibited. Transfer requests for the purpose of cannibalization will be considered, but are normally subordinate to requests for complete items.

> [63 FR 57234, Oct. 27, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 75107, Dec. 30, 2003]

    § 3200.7   Title.

#### § § 3200.7

    Title to excess personal property obtained under Part 3200 will automatically pass to the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions once USDA receives the SF-122 indicating that the institution has received the property. Note: When competing Federal claims are made for particular items of excess personal property held by agencies other than USDA, with or without payment of reimbursement, GSA will give preference to the Federal agency that will retain title in the Government.

    § 3200.8   Costs.

#### § § 3200.8

    Excess personal property obtained under this part is provided free of charge. However, the institution must pay all costs associated with packaging and transportation. The institution should specify the method of shipment on the SF-122.

    § 3200.9   Accountability and record keeping.

#### § § 3200.9

    USDA requires that Federal excess personal property received by an eligible institution pursuant to this part shall be placed into use for a research, educational, technical, or scientific activity, or for a related purpose, within 1 year of receipt of the property, and used for such purpose for at least 1 year thereafter. The institution's property management officer must establish and maintain accountable records identifying the property's location, description, utilization and value. To ensure that the excess personal property is being used for its intended purpose under this part, compliance reviews will be conducted by an authorized representative of USDA. The review will include site visit inspections of the property and the accountability and record keeping systems.

    § 3200.10   Disposal.

#### § § 3200.10

    Once the requirements in § 3200.9 are met for retention and use of property by the Institution and title is transferred, Federal excess personal property (FEPP) no longer needed by an Institution will be disposed of in accordance with the Institution's disposal practices. Regardless of ownership, FEPP must never be disposed of in any manner which is detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety. Also, any costs incurred during the disposal process are the responsibility of the Institution.

> [68 FR 75108, Dec. 30, 2003]

    § 3200.11   Liabilities and losses.

#### § § 3200.11

    USDA assumes no liability with respect to accidents, bodily injury, illness, or any other damages or loss related to excess personal property transferred under this part.

    (a) Each agency head will designate, in writing, an authorized official to approve transfers of excess computers or other technical equipment under this part consistent with the Department's policies on personal property management.

    (b) Excess computers or other technical equipment must first be internally screened to ensure it is not needed elsewhere in the Department.

    (c) To receive information concerning the availability of USDA excess computers or other technical equipment, an eligible recipient's PMO should contact any USDA office near to its location.

    (d) The USDA employee responsible for personal property, at the office contacted, will review the request for eligibility of the recipient and the availability of excess computers or other technical equipment. The USDA employee will inform the requestor of the outcome of the review (e.g. eligibility, the availability of excess computers or other technical equipment).

    (e) Eligible recipients will express their interest in receiving property under this part by submitting a request, on letterhead paper (electronic copy is acceptable), to a USDA authorized official. All requests must originate from, and be signed by, a representative of an eligible recipient city, town, or local government entity. Requests must include:

    (1) Type of excess computers or other technical equipment requested (should include specifications);

    (2) Justification for eligibility (see § 3203.2);

    (3) Contact information of the requestor;

    (g) If the condition of the property is acceptable, the recipient or its designated organization will coordinate with the USDA contact for transfer of the property. Since the USDA agency office may have several requests for property, it is critical that the recipient or its designated organization contact USDA as soon as possible. Property will usually be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, taking into account fair and equitable distribution of excess computers or other technical equipment to all eligible recipients.

    (h) Transfers will be accomplished using the appropriate USDA property transfer form. The transfer form must contain the following statement: “Property listed on this form is being transferred pursuant to the provisions in 7 CFR Part 3203.” The form must be signed by an authorized official of the USDA agency and an official of the recipient organization.

    (i) A copy of the request that transferred the property must be attached to the transfer order and kept in the USDA agency's files.

    (j) When property is transferred to a designated organization, a copy of the completed transfer document will be sent to the eligible recipient government entity for its records. Eligible recipients are responsible for following up with the designated organization they have designated for the final receipt of the property.

    (k) In cases where an agency receives competing requests for excess computers or other technical equipment, to the extent permitted by law, the agency shall give full consideration to such factors as national defense requirements, emergency needs, energy conservation, preclusion of new procurement, fair and equitable distribution, transportation costs, and retention of title in the Government.

    (l) Prior to transferring any property pursuant to this Act, the transferring agency must remove data from the excess computers or other technical equipment (memory or any kind of data storage device) according to accepted sanitization procedures. To the maximum extent practicable, the transferring agency must remove data using a means that does not remove, disable, destroy, or otherwise render unusable the excess computers or other technical equipment or components. It is imperative that agencies take the necessary steps to ensure that no personal computer, server, external storage device, or related electronic component is transferred that might contain sensitive or confidential information. See Departmental Manual 3575-001, Security Controls in the System Life Cycle/System Development Life Cycle, for additional guidance.

    (b) Excess computers or other technical equipment may be transferred for the purpose of cannibalization, provided that the requestor submits a statement clearly indicating that cannibalization of the requested property will have greater benefit than utilization of the item in its existing form. Cannibalization is a secondary use of equipment and, therefore, these requests are considered subordinate to requests for primary use.

    (c) Designated organizations will only receive property for cannibalization when it has been specifically requested by the recipient and the cannibalized parts must only be used in computers or other technical equipment destined for eligible recipients.

    § 3203.7   Title.

The designated organization must remove property from the USDA agency's premises within 15 calendar days after being notified that the property is available for pickup, unless otherwise coordinated with the USDA agency. If the recipient decides prior to picking up or removing the property that it no longer wants the property, it must notify the USDA agency that approved the transfer request that the property is no longer needed.

    § 3203.9   Accountability and recordkeeping.

#### § § 3203.9

    (a) USDA requires all excess computers or other technical equipment received by an eligible recipient pursuant to this part be placed into use within one year of receipt of the property and used for at least one year thereafter. The recipient's PMO must maintain accountable records for such property during this time period.

    (b) GSA requires that all excess personal property given to non-federal recipients be reported each fiscal year. USDA agencies that transfer property under this part must report the transfers in their annual reports to OPPM and include both the recipient and organization names.

    § 3203.11   Liabilities and losses.

#### § § 3203.11

    USDA assumes no liability with respect to accidents, bodily injury, illness, or any other damages or loss related to excess computers or other technical equipment transferred under this part.
