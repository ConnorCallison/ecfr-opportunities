#### § 1601.102

        (a) The FEHBAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and other applicable law and regulation.

        (b) The FEHBAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 5 CFR part 890, which provides the substantive policy guidance for administration of the FEHBP under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89. The following is the order of precedence in interpreting a contract provision under the FEHBP:

        (1) 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89;

        1601.103   Applicability.

#### § 1601.103

        The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEHBP pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 89. The FEHBAR implements and supplements the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant acquisition policies unique to the FEHBP.

#### § 1601.104-2

        (a)  The FEHBAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104. However, when a FAR part or subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, there will be no corresponding FEHBAR part, subpart, etc. The FEHBAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:

        (1) FAR;

        (2) FEHBAR.

        (b)  (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citation of chapter 16 material that has been published in the  will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

        (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 16 may be identified as “FEHBAR” followed by the section number.

        1601.106   OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § 1601.301

        (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the acquisition process for contracts in the FEHBP shall be consistent with the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are otherwise authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by the practical realities associated with the unique nature of health care procurements, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of Personnel Management shall be implemented as amendments to the FEHBAR and published in the  or as deviations to the FAR in accordance with FAR subpart 1.4.

        (b) Internal procedures, instructions, and guides that are necessary to clarify or implement the FEHBAR  OPM may be issued by agency officials specifically designated by the Director, OPM. Normally, such designations will be specified in the OPM Administrative Manual, which is routinely available to agency employees and will be made available to interested outside parties upon request. Clarifying or implementing procedures, instructions, and guides issued pursuant to this section of the FEHBAR must—

        (2) Groups consisting of the carrier's own employees;

        (3) Medicaid groups, Medicare-only groups, and groups that receive only excepted benefits as defined at 26 U.S.C. 9832(c);

#### § 1602.170-14

        (a)  (MLR) means the ratio of plan incurred claims, including the carrier's expenditures for activities that improve health care quality, to total premium revenue determined by OPM, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services in 45 CFR part 158.

        (b) The FEHB-specific MLR will be calculated on an annual basis. This FEHB-specific MLR will be measured against an FEHB-specific MLR threshold to be put forth by OPM no later than 12 calendar months before the beginning of plan years 2014 and beyond. OPM will publish the FEHB-specific MLR threshold no later than 8 months before the beginning of plan year 2013.

        (c) In place of the credibility adjustment at 45 CFR 158.230-158.232, OPM will set a separate credibility adjustment to account for the special circumstances of small FEHB plans in annual rate instructions to carriers.

This representative list includes organizations that own or contract with direct providers of healthcare or supplies, or organizations that process claims or manage patient care. A hospital is not considered to be a vendor for purposes of this chapter.

        (i) Where the total costs charged to the FEHB carrier for a contract term for FEHB members, including benefits and services, are reasonably expected to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB benefits costs, or

        (ii) Where the total administrative costs charged to the FEHB carrier for the contract term for FEHB members are reasonably expected to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB administrative costs (applicable to agreements where the provider is not responsible for FEHB benefits costs).

      Subpart 1603.70—Misleading, Deceptive, or Unfair Advertising

        1603.7001   Policy.

#### § 1603.7001

        (a) OPM prepares and distributes or makes available to Federal employees and annuitants a comparison booklet which presents summary information and a benefits brochure which details benefits, limitations, and premium rates for all participating plans. OPM does not encourage, support, or reimburse participating carriers for the costs of advertisements. However, while OPM believes that advertising is unnecessary, it recognizes that the decision to use advertising rests with each carrier.

        (b) OPM discourages advertising that is misleading or deceptive. This includes advertising that is directed at other carriers' plans participating in the Program and which uses incomplete or inappropriate comparisons or disparaging or minimizing techniques. Such unfair practices are prejudicial to the interests of the vast majority of carriers whose advertising is fair and accurate.

        (c) Failure to conform to the requirements of this subpart shall be a material breach of the contract and may result in withdrawal of approval to continue participation in the FEHB Program.

        (a) Be limited to the merits of the carrier's FEHBP plan and shall be limited to factual statements of the benefits and rates offered by that plan. The official document for benefit and rate comparisons among FEHBP plans is the comparison chart issued by OPM.

        (b) Not use the FEHBP logo.

        (c) Recognize that the officially approved plan brochure is the sole contractual statement of benefits, limitations, and exclusions. All advertisements that in any way discuss plan benefits shall contain the following statement:

        1604.7201   FEHB Program Large Provider Agreements.

#### § 1604.7201

        The following provisions apply to all experience-rated carriers participating in the FEHB Program:

        (a)  (1) All experience-rated carriers must provide notice to the contracting officer of their intent to enter into or to make a significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement. Significant modification means a 20% increase or more in the amount of the Large Provider Agreement:

        (i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider Agreement; and

        (ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising renewals or other options, or making a significant modification.

        (2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in writing and must, at a minimum:

        (i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider agreement will require;

        (ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;

        (iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the carrier selected the proposed provider, and, where applicable, what contracting method it used, including the kind of competition obtained;

        (iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the provider's profit; and, (v) Describe the provider risk provisions.

        (3) The contracting officer may request from the carrier any additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms and conditions prior to a Large Provider award and during the performance of the agreement.

        (4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the contracting officer will either give the carrier written comments or written notice that there will be no comments. If the contracting officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar days and explain how it intends to address any concerns.

        (5) When computing the carrier's annual service charge, the contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.

        (6) The contracting officer's review of any Large Provider agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a determination of the acceptability of terms or conditions of any provider agreement or the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the contract.

        (b)  The carrier must insert in all Large Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement as follows:

        (1) Records that support the annual statement of operations—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.

        (2) Enrollee records, if applicable—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.

        (c) Large Provider Agreements based on cost analysis are subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-2, “Audit and Records-Negotiation.”

        (d) Large Provider Agreements based on price analysis are subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70.

        1604.7202   Large Provider Agreement clause.

#### § 1604.7202

Current carriers must submit the certification once, along with their benefit and rate proposals for the 1995 contract year.

      Subpart 1609.70—Minimum Standards for Health Benefits Carriers

        1609.7001   Minimum standards for health benefits carriers.

#### § 1609.7001

        (a) The carrier of an approved health benefits plan shall meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; part 890 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, and the following standards. The carrier shall continue to meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, and the standards cited in this paragraph while under contract with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and termination of the contract in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204.

        (1) It must be lawfully engaged in the business of supplying health benefits.

        (2) It must have, in the judgement of OPM, the financial resources and experience in the field of health benefits to carry out its obligations under the plan.

        (3) It must keep such reasonable financial and statistical records, and furnish such reasonable financial and statistical reports with respect to the plan, as may be requested by OPM.

        (4) It must permit representatives of OPM and of the General Accounting Office to audit and examine its records and accounts which pertain, directly or indirectly, to the plan at such reasonable times and places as may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.

        (5) It must accept, subject to adjustment for error or fraud, in payment of its charges for health benefits for all enrollees in its plan, the enrollment charges received by the Employees Health Benefits (EHB) Fund less amounts set aside for the administrative and contingency reserves prescribed in 5 CFR 890.503. OPM makes available or pays the amounts within 30 days of receipt by the EHB Fund.

        (6) A carrier that is an employee organization must continue coverage, without requirement of membership, of any eligible survivor annuitants, former spouses continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.803, children temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(2), or former spouses temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(3).

        (7) It must timely submit to OPM a properly completed and signed novation or change-of-name agreement in accordance with subpart 1642.12 of this chapter.

        (b) In addition to the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, the carrier must perform the contract in accordance with prudent business practices. A carrier's sustained poor business practice in the management or administration of a health benefits plan is cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and termination of the carrier's contract. Prudent business practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

        (1) Timely compliance with OPM instructions and directives.

        (2) Legal and ethical business and health care practices.

        (3) Compliance with the terms of the FEHB contract, regulations and statutes.

        (4) Timely and accurate adjudication of claims or rendering of medical services.

        (5) A system for accounting for costs incurred under the contract, when required, which includes segregating and pricing FEHB medical utilization and allocating indirect and administrative costs in a reasonable and equitable manner.

        (6) Accurate accounting reports of actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs incurred in the administration of the contract.

        (7) Application of performance standards for assuring contract quality as required by 1646.270(d).

        (8) Establishment and maintenance of a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that:

        (i) The provision and payments of benefits and other expenses are in compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;

        (ii) FEHB funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and,

        (iii) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports required by OPM.

        (c) The following types of activities are examples of poor business practices which adversely affect the health benefits carrier's responsibility under its contract. A pattern of poor conduct or evidence of misconduct in these areas is cause for OPM to withdraw approval of the carrier:

        (1) Presenting false claims by charging expenses to the contract which according to the contract terms are not chargeable to the contract;

        (2) Using fraudulent or unethical business or health care practices or otherwise displaying a lack of business integrity or honesty;

        (3) Repeatedly and knowingly providing false or misleading information in the rate setting process;

        (4) Repeated failure to comply with OPM instructions and directives;

        (5) Having an accounting system that is incapable of separately accounting for costs incurred under the contract and/or that lacks the internal controls necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract; and

        (6) Failure to assure that the plan provides properly paid or denied claims, or providing medical services which are inconsistent with standards of good medical practice.

        (7) Entering into contracts or employment agreements with providers, provider groups, or health care workers that include provisions or financial incentives that directly or indirectly create an inducement to limit or restrict communication about medically necessary services to any individual covered under the FEHB Program. Financial incentives are defined as bonuses, withholds, commissions, profit sharing or other similar adjustments to basic compensation (e.g., service fee, capitation, salary) which have the effect of limiting or reducing communication about appropriate medically necessary services. Providers, health care workers, or health plan sponsoring organizations are not required to discuss treatment options that they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent with their professional judgment or ethical, moral or religious beliefs.

        (d) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to propose withdrawal of approval and hold a hearing based on the seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to effect corrective action.

#### § 1609.7002

        (a) The carrier of a PSHB plan shall meet the minimum standards as described in 1609.7001.

        (b) To the greatest extent practicable, an FEHB Carrier (defined in 1602.170-1) that offers an FEHB plan (defined in 1602.170-9) in which the total enrollment includes 1,500 or more Postal Service employees or Postal Service annuitants in the contract year beginning January 2023 must offer a PSHB plan in the initial contract year. OPM may exempt a comprehensive medical plan, as described in 5 U.S.C. 8903(4), from the requirement in this paragraph (b).

        1615.402   Pricing policy.

#### § 1615.402

        Pricing of FEHB contracts is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8902(i), 5 U.S.C. 8906, and other applicable law. FAR subpart 15.4 will be implemented by applying its policies and procedures—to the extent practicable—as follows:

        (a) For both experience-rated and community-rated contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be less than the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing data in the rate proposal for the following contract term.

        (b) Cost analysis will be used for contracts where premiums and subscription income are determined on the basis of experience rating.

        (c)(1) A combination of cost and price analysis will be used for contracts where premiums and subscription income are based on community-rates. For contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be less than the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing data. The carrier is required to submit only a rate proposal and abbreviated utilization data for the applicable contract year. OPM will evaluate the proposed rates by performing a basic reasonableness test on the information submitted. Rates failing this test will be subject to further review.

        (2) For contracts with fewer than 1,500 enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to submit its rate proposal, utilization data, and a certificate of accurate cost or pricing data required in 1615.406-2. In addition, OPM will require the carrier to complete the proposed rates form containing cost and pricing data, and the Community-Rate Questionnaire, but will not require the carrier to send these documents to OPM. The carrier will keep the documents on file for periodic auditor and actuarial review in accordance with 1652.204-70. OPM will perform a basic reasonableness test on the data submitted. Rates that do not pass this test will be subject to further OPM review.

        (3) For plan year 2012, plans will have the option of continuing to use the similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) rating methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section or using the MLR rating methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. All non-traditional community rated (TCR) plans will be required to submit FEHB-specific MLR information for every year beginning with plan year 2011.

        (i)  (A) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to provide the data and methodology used to determine the FEHB Program rates. OPM will also require the data and methodology used to determine the rates for the carrier's SSSG. The carrier will provide cost or pricing data required by OPM in its rate instructions for the applicable contract period. OPM will evaluate the data to ensure that the rate is reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this chapter. If necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional documentation.

        (B) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the SSSG. Such adjustments will be based on the rate determined by using the methodology (including discounts) the carrier used for the SSSG.

        (C) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with SSSG criteria provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period.

        (ii)  (A) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to provide the data and methodology used to determine the FEHB Program rates. OPM will also require the data and methodology used to determine the medical loss ratio (MLR) as defined in the ACA (Pub. L. 111-148) and as defined by HHS in 45 CFR part 158 for all FEHB community rated plans other than those required by state law to use Traditional Community Rating. The carrier will provide cost or pricing data, as well as the FEHB-specific MLR threshold data required by OPM in its rate instructions for the applicable contract period. OPM will evaluate the data to ensure that the rate is reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this chapter. If necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional documentation.

        (B) Contracts will be subject to a subsidization penalty if OPM determines that the FEHB group did not meet the FEHB-specific MLR threshold specified in the annual rate instruction to carriers. Such a subsidization penalty will be deposited into a Subsidization Penalty Account held at the U.S. Treasury. This Subsidization Penalty Account will be held in common with all community rated carriers and will be annually distributed to the contingency reserve accounts of all non-TCR community rated plans on a pro-rata basis.

        (C) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with the MLR criteria, including the FEHB-specific MLR threshold provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period. FEHB plans that are required by state law to use TCR are exempt from this requirement and will use the SSSG methodology outlined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

        (4) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the similarly-sized subscriber group (SSSG). Such adjustments will be based on the rate determined by using the methodology (including discounts) the carrier used for the SSSG.

        (5) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with SSSG criteria provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period.

        (d) The application of FAR 15.402(b)(2) should not be construed to prohibit the consideration of preceding year surpluses or deficits in carrier-held reserves in the rate adjustments for subsequent year renewals of contracts based, in whole or in part, on cost analysis.

        1615.404-4   Profit.

#### § 1615.404-4

        (a) When the pricing of FEHB Program contracts is determined by cost analysis (experience-rated) or by a combination of cost and price analysis (community rated), OPM will determine a performance based percentage of the price using a weighted guidelines structured approach based on the profit analysis factors described in 1615.404-70. For experience-rated plans, OPM will use the performance based percentage so determined to develop the profit or fee prenegotiation objective, which will be the total profit (service charge) negotiated for the contract. For community-rated plans, OPM will use the performance based percentage so determined to develop an adjustment to net-to-carrier premiums, (performance adjustment) to be made during the first quarter of the following contract period.

        (b) OPM will not guarantee a minimum service charge.

        1615.404-70   Profit analysis factors.

#### § 1615.404-70

        (a) OPM Contracting Officers will apply a weighted guidelines method in developing the performance based percentage for FEHB Program contracts. For experience-rated plans, the performance based percentage will be applied to projected incurred claims and allowable administrative expenses. For community-rated plans, the performance based percentage will be applied to subscription income and will be used to calculate a performance adjustment to net-to-carrier premiums, as described at 48 CFR 1632.170(a)(2), to be made during the first quarter of the following contract period. In the context of the factors outlined in FAR 15.404- 4(d), OPM will assess performance of FEHB carriers according to four factors.

        (1)  OPM will consider elements within such domains as preventive care, chronic disease management, medication use, and behavioral health. This factor incorporates elements from the FAR factor “contractor effort.”

        (2)  OPM will consider elements within such domains as communication, access, claims, and member experience/engagement. This factor incorporates elements of the FAR factor “contractor effort.”

        (3)  OPM will consider elements within such domains as utilization management, administrative, and cost trends. This factor incorporates elements of the FAR factors “contractor effort,” “contract cost risk,” and “cost control and other past accomplishments.”

        (4)  OPM will consider an assessment of contract performance in specific areas such as audit findings, fraud/waste/abuse, and responsiveness to OPM, benefits/network management, contract compliance, technology management, data security, and Federal socioeconomic programs. This factor could incorporate any of the FAR profit analysis factors listed at 15.404-4(d)(1)(i)-(vi).

        (b) The sum of the maximum scores for the profit analysis factors will be 1 percent.

        1615.406-2   Certificates of accurate cost or pricing data for community rated carriers.

#### § 1615.406-2

        (a) The contracting officer will require a carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(2) or (3) to execute one or more of the Certificates contained in this section. A carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(2) will complete the appropriate Certificate(s) and keep such on file at the carrier's place of business in accordance with 1652.204-70. A carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(3) will complete and submit the appropriate certificate(s) to OPM.

        (b) A carrier using the SSSG methodology described in 1615.402(c)(3)(i) will submit the “Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community-Rated Carriers (SSSG methodology)” along with its rate reconciliation during the first quarter of the applicable contract year. A carrier using the MLR methodology described in 1615.402(c)(3)(ii) will submit two forms. The “Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community-Rated Carriers (MLR methodology)” will be submitted along with the rate reconciliation during the first quarter of the applicable contract year. The “Certificate of Accurate MLR Calculation” will be submitted when the carrier submits its FEHB-specific MLR calculation to OPM.

        The clause set forth in section 1652.215-70 will be inserted in FEHB Program contracts, at or above the threshold in FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), that are based on a combination of cost and price analysis (community-rated).

        1615.470   Carrier investment of FEHB funds.

#### § 1615.470

        (a) Except for contracts based on a combination of cost and price analysis (community-rated), the carrier is required to invest and reinvest all funds on hand, including any attributable to the special reserve or the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, exceeding the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract.

        (b) The carrier is required to credit income earned from its investment of FEHB funds to the special reserve on behalf of the FEHB Program. If a carrier, for any reason, fails to invest excess FEHB funds or to credit any income due to the contract, it will return or credit any investment income lost to OPM or the special reserve.

        (c) Investment income. Investment income is the net amount earned by the carrier after deducting investment expenses.

        For the purposes of applying FAR 31.203(g)(2) to FEHB Program contracts, OPM considers the monthly rates used by some carriers to be a general practice in the insurance industry.

> [70 FR 31391, June 1, 2005]

        1631.203-70   Allocation techniques.

#### § 1631.203-70

        (a) Carriers shall use the following methods for allocating groupings of business unit indirect costs. Carriers shall consistently apply the methods and techniques established to classify direct and indirect costs, to group indirect costs and to allocate indirect costs to cost objectives.

        (1)  The preferred allocation technique is one that shows the consumption of resources in performance of the activities (input) for the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. This allocation technique should be used in circumstances where there is a direct and definitive relationship between the function(s) and the benefiting cost objectives. Measures of input ordinarily may be expressed in terms such as labor hours or square footage. This means costs may be allocated by use of a rate, such as a rate per labor hour or cost per square foot.

        (2)  Where input measures are unavailable or impractical to determine, the basis for allocation may be a measure of the output of the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. The output becomes a substitute measure for the use of resources and is a reasonable alternative when a direct measure of input is impractical. Output may be measured in terms of units of end product produced by the function(s). Examples of output measures include number of claims processed by a claims processing center, number of pages printed in a print shop, number of purchase orders processed by a purchasing department, or number of hires by a personnel office.

        (3)  Where neither activity (input) nor output of the function(s) can be measured practically, a surrogate must be used to measure the resources utilized. Surrogates used to represent the relationship generally measure the benefit to the cost objectives receiving the service and should vary in proportion to the services received. For example, if a personnel department provides various services that cannot be measured practically on an activity (input) or output basis, number of personnel served might reasonably represent the use of resources of the personnel function for the cost objectives receiving the service, where this base varies in proportion to the services performed.

        (4)  Some cost groupings cannot readily be allocated on measures of specific beneficial or causal relationships under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. Such costs do not have a direct and definitive relationship to the benefiting cost objectives. Generally, the cost of overall management activities falls in this category. Overall management costs should be grouped in relation to the activities managed. The base selected to measure the allocation of these indirect costs to cost objectives should be a base representative of the entire activity being managed. For example, the total operating expenses of activities managed might be a reasonable base for allocating the general indirect costs of a business unit. Another reasonable method for allocating general indirect costs might be to base them on a percentage of contracts. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather are examples of allocation methods that may be acceptable under individual circumstances. See also General and Administrative (G&A) expenses, FEHBAR 1631.203-71.

        (b) Carriers that use multiple cost centers to accumulate and allocate costs shall apply the techniques in paragraph (a) of this section at each step of the allocation process. Accordingly, the allocation of costs among cost centers at the initial entry into the cost accounting system shall be made in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Likewise, the allocation of the cost of interim cost centers to final cost centers is subject to paragraph (a) of this section. If costs of final cost centers are allocated among final cost objectives, the allocation shall also be made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. It is possible that carriers using multiple cost centers to accumulate and allocate costs may not have any direct costs, i.e., costs identified specifically with a final cost objective.

        (c) The allocation of business unit general and administrative expenses and the allocation of home office expenses to segments are also subject to FEHBAR 1631.203-71 and FEHBAR 1631.203-72, respectively.

        1631.203-71   Business unit General and Administrative (G&A) expenses.

#### § 1631.203-71

        G&A expenses shall be allocated to final cost objectives by a base or method that represents the total activity of the business unit.

        1631.203-72   Home office expense.

#### § 1631.203-72

        A carrier's practices for allocating home office expenses to the segments of the carrier will be acceptable for purposes of FAR 31.203 if they are allocated on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship between the home office activities and the segments to which the expenses are allocated. Expenses that cannot be allocated on the basis of a more specific beneficial or causal relationship should be allocated on a basis representative of the entire activity being managed. The compliance of such allocations with FAR 31.203 shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each situation.

#### § 1631.205-10

        For the purposes of FAR 31.205-10(b)(3), the estimated facilities capital cost of money is specifically identified if it is identified in the prior year's Annual Accounting Statement or, for new experience-rated carriers, the supplemental information supporting submitted costs (such as the Supplemental Schedule of Administrative Expenses).

#### § 1631.205-41

        5 U.S.C. 8909(f)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or other monetary payment, directly or indirectly, on FEHB premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those entities. Therefore, FAR 31.205-41 is modified to include those taxes as unallowable costs. The prohibited payments, referred to elsewhere in these regulations as “premium taxes,” applies to all payments directed by States or municipalities, regardless of how they may be titled, to whom they must be paid, or the purpose for which they are collected, and it applies to all forms of direct and indirect measurements on FEHBP premiums, however modified, to include cost per contract or enrollee, with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.

> [56 FR 57496, Nov. 12, 1991]

        1631.205-70   FEHBP public relations and advertising costs.

#### § 1631.205-70

        (a) The cost of media messages that are directed at advising current FEHBP subscribers on how to obtain benefits shall be an allowable expense within the meaning of FAR 31.205-1 because this service is directly related to performance of the FEHBP contract. If there is any question about the allowability of such a cost, the carrier may request advance approval regarding the content and cost of the message.

        (b) Costs of media messages not provided for in paragraph (a) of this section are allowable if the content is specifically approved by the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) The primary effect of the message is to disseminate information on health care cost containment or preventive health care;

        (2) The costs of the carrier's messages are allocated to all underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and

        (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the carrier's messages to be charged to the FEHBP in advance of the contract year.

        (c) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the carrier (or subcontractor) for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling its health plan are not allowable.

        1631.205-71   FEHBP bad debts.

#### § 1631.205-71

        Erroneous benefit payments are not automatically disallowed by FAR 31.205-3.

        1631.205-72   FEHBP compensation for personal services.

#### § 1631.205-72

        (a) Overtime on an FEHBP contract would normally meet the condition specified in FAR 22.103. Premiums for overtime, extra-pay shifts, and multi-shifts meeting the specified conditions shall be allowed without prior approval.

        (b)(1) The costs of compensated personal absence shall be assigned to the cost accounting period or periods in which entitlement was earned. Entitlement means an employee's right, whether conditional or unconditional, to receive a determinable amount of compensated personal absence, or pay in lieu thereof.

        (2) If at the beginning of the 1st year a carrier subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section has a liability for accrued but unpaid expenses for compensated personal absences that would otherwise be allocable to FEHB contracts, the carrier may include such costs in a suspense account. The suspense account may be amortized and included in government contract costs at a rate not exceeding 20 percent per year.

        1631.205-73   FEHBP interest expense.

#### § 1631.205-73

        (a) Interest charges incurred in the administration of FEHBP contracts are not allowable in accordance with FAR 31.205-20. However, interest charges that are associated with the carrier's investment of FEHBP account funds are not considered administrative costs and may be allowable under very limited circumstances if all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) Borrowing is limited to the positive balance of the carrier's entire FEHBP investment portfolio;

        (2) FEHBP funds are tied up in long-term securities;

        (3) Liquidation of long-term securities would cost more than the cost of the interest;

        (4) The interest rates charged are at or below current market rates; and

        (5) Advance written approval of the contracting officer is obtained before such costs are incurred.

        (b) The carrier must demonstrate on a case-by-case basis that borrowing rather than cashing in long-term investments shall actually result in cost savings to the FEHB Program. Satisfactory demonstration of cost savings is a prerequisite to contracting officer approval of the interest cost as a charge to the contract.

        (c) If the interest charge is allowed, the risk factor in the service charge will be adjusted downward so that the carrier does not recover interest costs through both the service charge and an allowance under this paragraph.

        1631.205-74   FEHBP losses on other contracts.

#### § 1631.205-74

        FAR 31.205-23 shall not be construed to prohibit the application of the normal “loss carry forward” principle that is fundamental to continuing insurance contracts that are based on experience rating.

        1631.205-75   Selling costs.

#### § 1631.205-75

        (a) FAR 31.205-38 is modified to eliminate from allowable costs those costs related to sales promotion and the payment of sales commissions fees or salaries to employees or outside commercial or selling agencies for enrolling Federal subscribers in a particular FEHB plan.

        (b) Selling costs are allowable costs to FEHBP contracts to the extent that they are necessary for conducting annual contract negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities necessary for ongoing contract administration. Personnel and related travel costs are allowable for attendance at Open Season Health fairs and other similar activities at which carriers give enrollees information about their choices among health plans (but see FAR 31.205-1 ‘Public relations and advertising costs’, and The Federal Employees Health Benefits Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, Subchapter S2-3(f) ‘Controlling contacts between employees and carriers’).

        1631.205-76   Trade, business, technical, and professional activity costs.

#### § 1631.205-76

        (a) FEHBP participating plans, carriers, and underwriters shall seek the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional activities (FAR 31.205-43) when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEHBP will exceed $1,000 annually and when the carrier or underwriter allocates more than 50% of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEHBP.

        (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is required, the carrier or underwriter must demonstrate conclusively that membership in such an organization and participation in its activities extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable relationship to providing care and services to FEHBP enrollees, and that the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.

        1631.205-77   FEHBP start-up and other nonrecurring costs.

#### § 1631.205-77

        Precontract costs (FAR 31.205-32) shall be allowed only to the extent provided for by advance agreement in accordance with FAR 31.109.

        1631.205-78   FEHBP printed material costs.

#### § 1631.205-78

        Unless OPM determines that it is in the best interest of the FEHBP to do otherwise, if a carrier orders printed material that is available from the Government Printing Office (GPO) under the “rider system” from another source, the allowable contract charges shall be the lesser of the amount actually paid or the cost that would have been incurred had the carrier ridden OPM's GPO order.

        1631.205-79   Mandatory statutory reserves.

#### § 1631.205-79

        Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowed unless provided for in the contract. When the term “mandatory statutory reserve” is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement imposed by State law upon the carrier to set aside a specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds become available for the general use of the carrier, a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-5.

        1631.205-80   Major subcontractor service charges.

#### § 1631.205-80

        In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, administration of claims and payment of benefits, and payment or provision of actual health services, and/or assumption of insurance risk or underwriting, when costs are determined on the basis of actual costs incurred or experience rating, any amount that exceeds the allowable cost of the subcontract (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, contribution to reserve, surplus, or any other title) is not allowable under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the service charge negotiated between OPM and the Carrier.

        1631.205-81   Inferred reasonableness.

#### § 1631.205-81

        If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of 1652.244-70, and subsequently obtains the Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the reasonableness of the subcontract's costs shall be inferred.

        1632.170   Recurring premium payments to carriers.

#### § 1632.170

        (a)(1)  OPM will pay to carriers of community-rated plans the premium payments received for the plan less the amounts credited to the contingency and administrative reserves, amounts assessed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and amounts due for other contractual obligations. Premium payments will be due and payable not later than 30 days after receipt by the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Fund.

        (2) The difference between one percent and the performance based percentage of the contract price described at 1615.404-4 will be multiplied by the carrier's subscription income for the year of performance and the resulting amount (performance adjustment) will be withheld from the net-to-carrier premium disbursement during the first quarter of the following contract period unless an alternative payment arrangement is made with the carrier's Contracting Officer. Amounts withheld from a community rated plan's premium disbursement will be deposited into the plan's Contingency Reserve.

        (3) Any subsidization penalty levied against a community rated plan as outlined in 48 CFR 1615.402(c)(3)(ii)(B) must be paid within 60 days from notification. If payment is not received within the 60 day period, OPM will withhold from the community rated carriers the periodic premium payment payable until fully recovered. OPM will deposit the withheld funds in the subsidization penalty reserve described in 5 CFR 890.503(c)(6).

        (b)(1)  OPM will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. Premium payments received for the plan, less the amounts credited to the contingency and administrative reserves and amounts for other obligations due under the contract, will be made available for carrier drawdown not later than 30 days after receipt by the FEHB Fund.

        (2) Withdrawals from the LOC account will be made on a checks-presented basis. Under a checks-presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is delayed until the checks issued for FEHB Program disbursements are presented to the carrier's bank for payment.

        (3) OPM may grant a waiver of the restriction of LOC disbursements to a checks-presented basis if the carrier requests the waiver in writing and demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the checks-presented basis of LOC disbursements will result in significantly increased liability under the contract, or that the checks-presented basis of LOC disbursements is otherwise clearly and significantly detrimental to the operation of the plan. Payments to carriers that have been granted a waiver may be made by an alternative payment methodology, subject to OPM approval.

        (b) A carrier for an FEHB plan may apply to OPM at any time for a payment from the contingency reserve that is in addition to those amounts, if any, paid under 5 CFR 890.503(c)(1) through (c)(4), if the carrier can show good cause, such as, unexpected adverse claims experience. OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in part and will advise the carrier of its decision. However, OPM shall not unreasonably withhold approval for amounts requested that exceed the plan's preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve.

        1632.771   Non-commingling of FEHBP funds.

#### § 1632.771

        (a) This section applies to contracts based on cost analysis.

        (b) Carrier or underwriter commingling of FEHBP funds with those from other sources makes it difficult to precisely determine FEHBP cash balances at any given time or to precisely determine investment income attributable to FEHBP invested assets.

        (c) FEHBP funds shall be maintained separately from other cash and investments of the carrier or underwriter. Cash and investment balances reported on FEHBP Annual Accounting Statements must agree with the carrier's books and records.

        (d) This requirement may be waived by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 1652.232-72 when adequate accounting and other controls are in effect. If the requirement is waived, the waiver will remain in effect until it is withdrawn by OPM. The waiver shall be withdrawn if OPM determines that the accounting controls are no longer adequate to properly account for FEHBP funds.

        (b) Failure to submit the properly completed and signed Novation Agreement in a timely manner shall be cause for termination of the contract by OPM in accordance with FEHBAR 1652.249-70.

        (c) The Contracting Officer shall terminate the contract if it is determined not to be in the Government's interest to recognize a successor in interest to the contract. The effective date will be decided by the Contracting Officer after considering the best interests of FEHBP enrollees.

        When it is in the best interest of FEHBP enrollees to continue a contract for an interim period after the carrier discontinues its operations and has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (or other descriptive term), but before a successor in interest has been recognized by OPM, the carrier may submit for OPM approval a Management Agreement that enables it to continue a contract through an agreement with a third party to administer the day-to-day performance of the contract. Examples of situations in which a Management Agreement may be accepted by OPM are:

        (a) When a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria for a novation;

        (b) While a request for a novation is pending;

        (c) While awaiting a decision on a request for a novation;

        (d) As an interim measure, when the timing of a transfer of assets or the timing of a carrier's withdrawal make administration of the contract inconvenient;

        (e) When it is not in the interests of the Government to either recognize a successor in interest or to immediately terminate the existing FEHBP contract.

        1644.170   Policy for FEHB Program subcontracting.

#### § 1644.170

        (a)  Carriers must follow commercially reasonable procurement procedures that comply, when required, with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) policies and procedures relating to competition and contract pricing for the acquisition of both commercial and noncommercial items.

        (b)  For all experience-rated contracts, carriers will notify the Contracting officer in writing at least 30 days in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as otherwise specified by the contract, if: the amount of the subcontract or the amount of the subcontract and modification charged to the FEHB Program equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract's costs. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty when considering the performance aspect of the carriers' service charge.

        (1) All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 “Audit and Records-Negotiations” if based on cost analysis, and subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70 “FEHB Inspection” if based on price analysis.

        (2) In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:

        (i) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall provide the total cost/price for the base year.

        (ii) The carrier shall provide advance notification of any modifications, options, including quantity or service options and option periods, and renewals of “evergreen contracts” that cause the total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original subcontract will be required to perform the review.

        (iii) The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act.

#### § 1646.201

        (a) This section prescribes general policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under the FEHB contract conform to the contract's quality and audit requirements.

        (b) OPM will periodically evaluate the contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by the contract and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in the contract. After the initial review, subsequent reviews may be limited to changes in the contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does not diminish the contractor's obligation to apply the full internal control system.

        (c) OPM will issue specific quality performance standards for the FEHB contracts and will inform carriers of the applicable standards prior to negotiations for the contract year. OPM will benchmark its standards against standards generally accepted in the insurance industry. The contracting officer may authorize nationally recognized standards to be used to fulfill this requirement. FEHB carriers will comply with the performance standards issued by OPM.

        (d) In addition to reviewing carriers' quality assurance programs, OPM will periodically audit contractors, subcontractors and Large Providers' books and records to assure compliance with FEHB law, regulations, and the contract.
