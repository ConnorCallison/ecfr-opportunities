    Subpart A—General Requirements

      § 30.1   Purpose and definitions.

#### § § 30.1

      (a) This part sets forth the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) as required under the provisions of Title 13, United States Code (U.S.C.), Chapter 9, section 301. These regulations are revised pursuant to provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Public Law 107-228 (the Act). This Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to publish regulations mandating that all persons who are required to file export information under Chapter 9 of 13 U.S.C., file such information through the Automated Export System (AES) for all shipments where a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) was previously required. The law further authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations regarding imposition of civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of the Act and these regulations.

      (b) Electronic filing through the AES strengthens the U.S. government's ability to prevent the export of certain items to unauthorized destinations and/or end users because the AES aids in targeting, identifying, and when necessary confiscating suspicious or illegal shipments prior to exportation.

      (c) Definitions used in the FTR. As used in this part, the following definitions apply:

      The USPPI or authorized agent who reports export information electronically to the AES, or through AES

      (H) Used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations, except as noted in CBP regulations.

      (2)  The USPPI has four means for filing EEI: use AES develop AES software using the AESTIR (see ); purchase software developed by certified vendors using the AESTIR; or use an authorized agent. An FPPI can only use an authorized agent in a routed transaction.

      (b) —(1) The EEI shall be filed prior to exportation (see § 30.4) unless the USPPI has been approved to submit export data on a postdeparture basis (see § 30.5(c)). Shipments requiring a license or license exemption may be filed postdeparture only when the appropriate licensing agency has granted the USPPI authorization. See Subpart B of this part.

      (2) Specific data elements required for EEI filing are contained in § 30.6.

      (3) The AES downtime procedures provide uniform instructions for processing export transactions when the government's AES or AES is unavailable for transmission. (See § 30.4(b)(1) and (4)).

      (4) Instructions for particular types of transactions and exemptions from these requirements are found in Subparts C and D of this part.

      (5) The EEI is required to be filed in the AES prior to export for shipments by vessel going directly to the countries identified in U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and by aircraft going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2).)

      (c)  The USPPI or authorized agent will either submit an ACE Exporter Account Application or a Letter of Intent based on their transmission method and, as a result, may be subject to the certification process.

      (1)  USPPIs or authorized agents who choose to file via the AESDirect shall complete an online ACE Exporter Account Application. In addition, once the ACE Exporter Account is created, all users must agree to the AES Certification Statements prior to filing through _AESDirect._

      (2)  USPPIs or authorized agents who choose to file by a means other than AESDirect shall submit a Letter of Intent to CBP and may be required to complete the certification process.

      (i)  A two-part communication test to ascertain whether the system is capable of both transmitting data to and receiving responses from the AES. CBP client representatives make the sole determination as to whether or not the system of the self-programming filer, service center, or software vendor passes certification.

      (ii)

      (A) Self-programming USPPIs or authorized agents;

      (B) Service centers; and

      (C) Software vendors who develop AES software.

      (d)  The following types of transactions are outside the scope of this part and shall be excluded from EEI filing.

      (1) Goods shipped under CBP bond through the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands from one foreign country or area to another where such goods do not enter the consumption channels of the United States.

      (2) Except Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, goods shipped from the U.S. territories and goods shipped between the United States and these territories do not require EEI filing. However, goods transiting U.S. territories to foreign destinations require EEI filing.

      § 30.3   Electronic Export Information filer requirements, parties to export transactions, and responsibilities of parties to export transactions.

#### § § 30.3

      (a)  The filer of EEI for export transactions is either the USPPI, or the U.S. authorized agent. All EEI submitted to the AES shall be complete, correct, and based on personal knowledge of the facts stated or on information furnished by the parties to the export transaction. The filer shall be physically located in the United States at the time of filing, have an EIN or DUNS and be certified to report in the AES. In the event that the filer does not have an EIN or DUNS, the filer must obtain an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service. The filer is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the EEI, except insofar as that party can demonstrate that it reasonably relied on information furnished by other responsible persons participating in the transaction. All parties involved in export transactions, including U.S. authorized agents, should be aware that invoices and other commercial documents may not necessarily contain all the information needed to prepare the EEI. The parties shall ensure that all information needed for reporting to the AES, including correct export licensing information, is provided to the U.S. authorized agent for the purpose of correctly preparing the EEI.

      (b) —(1)  Those persons in a transaction that receive the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, are considered principal parties to the transaction. Generally, the principal parties in interest in a transaction are the seller and buyer. In most cases, the forwarding or other agent is not a principal party in interest.

      (2)  For purposes of filing EEI, the USPPI is the person or legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the transaction. Generally, that person or entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, order party, or foreign entity if in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for export. The foreign entity shall be listed as the USPPI if it is in the United States when the items are purchased or obtained for export. The foreign entity shall then follow the provisions for filing the EEI specified in §§ 30.3 and 30.6 pertaining to the _USPPI._

      (i) If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods directly to an entity in a foreign area, the U.S. manufacturer shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.

      (ii) If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods, as a domestic sale, to a U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) and that U.S. buyer sells the goods for export to a FPPI, the U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.

      (iii) If a U.S. order party directly arranges for the sale and export of goods to the FPPI, the U.S. order party shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.

      (iv) If a customs broker is listed as the importer of record when entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or warehousing entry, the customs broker may be listed as the USPPI in the EEI if the goods are subsequently exported without change or enhancement.

      (v) If a foreign person is listed as the importer of record when entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or warehousing entry, the customs broker who entered the goods, may be listed as the USPPI in the EEI if the goods are subsequently exported without change or enhancement.

      (3)  The agent shall be authorized by the USPPI or, in the case of a routed export transaction, the agent shall be authorized by the FPPI to prepare and file the EEI. In a routed export transaction, the authorized agent can be the “exporter” for export control purposes as defined in 15 CFR 772.1 of the U.S. Department of Commerce EAR. However, the authorized agent shall not be shown as the USPPI in the EEI unless the agent acts as a USPPI in the export transaction as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section.

      (4)  A carrier is an individual or legal entity in the business of transporting passengers or goods. Airlines, trucking companies, railroad companies, shipping lines, and pipeline companies are all examples of carriers.

      (c) —(1)  (i) The USPPI can prepare and file the EEI itself, or it can authorize an agent to prepare and file the EEI on its behalf. If the USPPI prepares the EEI itself, the USPPI is responsible for the accuracy and timely transmission of all the export information reported to the AES.

      (ii) When the USPPI authorizes an agent to file the EEI on its behalf, the USPPI is responsible for:

      (A) Providing the authorized agent with accurate and timely export information necessary to file the EEI.

      (B) Providing the authorized agent with a power of attorney or written authorization to file the EEI (see paragraph (f) of this section for written authorization requirements for agents).

      (C) Retaining documentation to support the information provided to the authorized agent for filing the EEI, as specified in § 30.10.

      (2)  The agent, when authorized by a USPPI to prepare and file the EEI for an export transaction, is responsible for performing the following activities:

      (i) Accurate preparation and timely filing of the EEI based on information received from the USPPI and other parties involved in the transaction.

      (ii) Obtaining a power of attorney or written authorization from the USPPI to file the EEI.

      (iii) Retaining documentation to support the information reported to the AES, as specified in § 30.10.

      (iv) Upon request, providing the USPPI with a copy of the export information filed in a mutually agreed upon format.

      (3)  (i) The carrier must not load or move cargo unless the required documentation, from the USPPI or authorized agent, contains the required AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations. This information must be cited on the first page of the bill of lading, air waybill, or other commercial loading documents.

      (ii) The carrier must annotate the AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations on the carrier's outbound manifest when required.

      (iii) The carrier is responsible for presenting the required AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations to the CBP Port Director at the port of export as stated in Subpart E of this part. Such presentation shall be without material change or amendment of the proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citation.

      (iv) The carrier shall notify the USPPI or the authorized agent of changes to the transportation data, and the USPPI or the authorized agent shall electronically transmit the corrections, cancellations, or amendments as soon as the corrections are known in accordance with § 30.9. Manifest amendments must be made in accordance with CBP regulations.

      (v) Retain documents pertaining to the export shipment as specified in § 30.10.

      (d)  Responsibilities of USPPIs and authorized agents filing EEI are as follows:

      (1) Filing complete and accurate information (see § 30.4 for a delineation of filing responsibilities of USPPIs and authorized agents).

      (2) Filing information in a timely manner in accordance with the provisions and requirements contained in this part.

      (3) Responding to fatal errors, warning, verify and reminder messages, and compliance alerts generated by the AES in accordance with provisions and requirements contained in this part.

      (4) Providing the exporting carrier with the required proof of filing citations or exemption legends in accordance with provisions contained in this part.

      (5) Promptly filing corrections or cancellations to EEI in accordance with provisions contained in § 30.9.

      (6) Retaining all necessary and proper documentation related to EEI transactions in accordance with provisions contained in this part (see § 30.10 for specific requirements for retaining and producing documentation for export shipments).

      (e)  The Census Bureau recognizes “routed export transactions” as a subset of export transactions. A routed export transaction is a transaction in which the FPPI authorizes a U.S. agent to facilitate the export of items from the United States and to prepare and file EEI.

      (1)  In a routed export transaction, the FPPI may authorize or agree to allow the USPPI to prepare and file the EEI. If the FPPI agrees to allow the USPPI to file the EEI, the FPPI must provide a written authorization to the USPPI assuming the responsibility for filing. The USPPI may authorize an agent to file the EEI on its behalf. If the USPPI or its agent prepares and files the EEI, it shall retain documentation to support the EEI filed. If the FPPI agrees to allow the USPPI to file EEI, the filing of the export transaction shall be treated as a routed export transaction. If the FPPI authorizes an agent to prepare and file the EEI, the USPPI shall retain documentation to support the information provided to the agent for preparing the EEI as specified in § 30.10 and provide the agent with the following information to assist in preparing the EEI:

      (i) Name and address of the USPPI.

      (ii) USPPI Identification Number.

      (iii) State of origin (State).

      (iv) FTZ if applicable.

      (v) Commercial description of commodities.

      (vi) Origin of goods indicator: Domestic (D) or Foreign (F).

      (vii) Schedule B or HTSUSA, Classification Commodity Code.

      (viii) Quantities/units of measure.

      (ix) Value.

      (x) Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or sufficient technical information to determine the ECCN.

      (xi) All licensing information necessary to file the EEI for commodities where the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, or other U.S. government agency issues a license for the commodities being exported, or the merchandise is being exported under a license exemption or license exception.

      (xii) Any information that it knows will affect the determination of license authorization (see Subpart B of this part for additional information on licensing requirements).

      (2)  In a routed export transaction, if an authorized agent is preparing and filing the EEI on behalf of the FPPI, the authorized agent must obtain a power of attorney or written authorization from the FPPI and prepare and file the EEI based on information obtained from the USPPI or other parties involved in the transaction. The authorized agent shall be responsible for filing EEI accurately and timely in accordance with the FTR. Upon request, the authorized agent will provide the USPPI with a copy of the power of attorney or written authorization from the FPPI. The authorized agent shall also retain documentation to support the EEI reported through the AES. The authorized agent shall upon request, provide the USPPI with the data elements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (xii) of this section, the date of export as submitted through the AES, the filer name, and the ITN. The authorized agent shall provide the following information through the AES:

      (i) Date of export.

      (ii) Transportation Reference Number.

      (iii) Ultimate consignee.

      (iv) Intermediate consignee, if applicable.

      (v) Authorized agent name and address.

      (vi) EIN or DUNS of the authorized agent.

      (vii) Country of ultimate destination.

      (viii) Method of transportation.

      (ix) Carrier identification and conveyance name.

      (x) Port of export.

      (xi) Foreign port of unlading.

      (xii) Shipping weight.

      (xiii) ECCN.

      (xiv) License or license exemption information.

      (xv) Ultimate consignee type.

      (f)  In a power of attorney or other written authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal (see 15 CFR 758.1(h) of the EAR). In cases where an authorized agent is filing EEI to the AES, the agent shall obtain a power of attorney or written authorization from a principal party in interest to file the information on its behalf. A power of attorney or written authorization should specify the responsibilities of the parties with particularity and should state that the agent has authority to act on behalf of a principal party in interest as its true and lawful agent for purposes of creating and filing EEI in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States. In routed export transactions the USPPI is not required to provide an agent of the FPPI with a power of attorney or written authorization.

      § 30.4   Electronic Export Information filing procedures, deadlines, and certification statements.

#### § § 30.4

      Two electronic filing options (predeparture and postdeparture) for transmitting EEI are available to the USPPI or authorized agent. The electronic postdeparture filing takes into account that complete information concerning export shipments may not always be available prior to exportation and accommodates these circumstances by providing, when authorized, for filing of EEI after departure. For example, for exports of seasonal and agricultural commodities, only estimated quantities, values, and consignees may be known prior to exportation. The procedures for obtaining certification as an AES filer and for applying for authorization to file on a postdeparture basis are described in § 30.5.

      (a)  The EEI shall always be transmitted prior to departure for the following types of shipments:

      (1) Used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations.

      (2) Essential and precursor chemicals requiring a permit from the DEA;

      (3) Shipments defined as “sensitive” by Executive Order;

      (4) Shipments where a U.S. government agency requires predeparture filing;

      (5) Shipments defined as “routed export transactions” (see § 30.3(e));

      (6) Shipments where complete outbound manifests are required prior to clearing vessels going directly to the countries identified in U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and aircraft going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulation 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2));

      (7) Items identified on the USML of the ITAR (22 CFR 121);

      (8) Shipments that require a license from the BIS and exports listed under BIS's grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status (see 15 CFR 758.2);

      (9) Shipments that require a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

      (10) Shipments of rough diamonds classified under HS subheadings 7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31 and exported (reexported) in accordance with the Kimberley Process; and

      (11) Shipments for which the USPPI has not been approved for postdeparture filing.

      (b)  The USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the required EEI and have received the AES ITN no later than the time period specified as follows:

      (1) For USML shipments, refer to the ITAR (22 CFR 123.22(b)(1)) for specific requirements concerning predeparture filing time frames. In addition, if a filer is unable to acquire an ITN because the AES or AES is not operating, the filer shall not export until the AES is operating and an ITN is acquired. The downtime filing citation is not to be used when the filer's system is down or experiencing delays.

      (2) For non-USML shipments, except shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico, file the EEI and provide the ITN as follows (See § 30.4(b)(3), for filing timeframes for shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico):

      (i) For vessel cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier twenty-four hours prior to loading cargo on the vessel at the U.S. port where the cargo is laden.

      (ii) For air cargo, including cargo being transported by Air Express Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the aircraft.

      (iii) For truck cargo, including cargo departing by Express Consignment Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than one (1) hour prior to the arrival of the truck at the United States border to go foreign.

      (iv) For rail cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to the time the train arrives at the U.S. border to go foreign.

      (v) For mail, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI as required by § 30.6 and provide the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend to the U.S. Postal Service no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation.

      (vi) For all other modes, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the required EEI no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation.

      (3) For shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico, the USPPI or authorized agent shall provide the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend to the exporting carrier by the time the shipment arrives at the port of unlading.

      (4) For non-USML shipments when the AES or AES is unavailable, use the following instructions:

      (i) If the participant's AES is unavailable, the filer must delay the export of the goods or find an alternative filing method;

      (ii) If AES or AES is unavailable, the goods may be exported and the filer must:

      (A) Provide the appropriate downtime filing citation as described in § 30.7(b) and appendix B of this part; and

      (B) Report the EEI at the first opportunity AES or AES is available.

      (5) For used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI as required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation to the CBP at least 72 hours prior to export. The filer must also provide the carrier with the filing citation as required by paragraph (b) of this section.

      (c) —(1)  Postdeparture filing is only available for approved USPPIs. For all methods of transportation other than pipeline, approved USPPIs or their authorized agent may file data elements required in accordance with § 30.6 no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of exportation, except for shipments where predeparture filing is specifically required.

      (2)  USPPIs or authorized agents may file data elements required by § 30.6 no later than four (4) calendar days following the end of the month. The operator of a pipeline may transport goods to a foreign country without the prior filing of the proof of filing citation, exemption, or exclusion legend, on the condition that within four (4) calendar days following the end of each calendar month the operator will deliver to the CBP Port Director the proof of filing citation, exemption, or exclusion legend covering all exports through the pipeline to each consignee during the month.

      (d)  The USPPI or the authorized agent shall provide the exporting carrier with the proof of filing citation and exemption and exclusion legends as described in § 30.7.

      (e)  Any voided KPC must be faxed by the voiding party to the Census Bureau on (800) 457-7328, or provided by other methods as permitted by the Census Bureau, immediately upon voiding. The collection of KPCs, including voided KPCs, is performed pursuant to the Clean Diamond Trade Act, Public Law 108-19, 19 U.S.C. Section 3901  (CDTA), and Executive Order 13312, and not Title 13, U.S.C.

      § 30.5   Electronic Export Information filing processes and standards.

#### § § 30.5

      (a)-(b) [Reserved]

      (c)  Postdeparture filing is a privilege granted to approved USPPIs for their EEI to be filed up to five (5) calendar days after the date of export. The USPPI or its authorized agent may not transmit EEI postdeparture for certain types of shipments that are identified in § 30.4(a). The USPPI may apply for postdeparture filing privileges by submitting a postdeparture filing application at  An authorized agent may not apply on behalf of a USPPI. The Census Bureau will distribute the applications submitted by USPPI's who are applying for postdeparture to the CBP and the other federal government partnership agencies for their review and approval. Failure to meet the standards of the Census Bureau, CBP or any of the partnership agencies is reason for denial of the AES applicant for postdeparture filing privileges. Each partnership agency will develop its own internal postdeparture filing acceptance standards, and each agency will notify the Census Bureau of the USPPI's success or failure to meet that agency's acceptance standards. Any partnership agency may require additional information from USPPIs that are applying for postdeparture filing. The Census Bureau will notify the USPPI of the decision to either deny or approve its application for postdeparture filing privileges within ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the postdeparture filing application by the Census Bureau.

      (1)  The Census Bureau may deny a USPPI's application for postdeparture filing privileges for any of the following reasons:

      (i) There is no history of filing for the USPPI through the AES.

      (ii) The USPPI's volume of EEI reported through the AES does not warrant participation in postdeparture filing.

      (iii) The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI through the AES in a timely and accurate manner.

      (iv) The USPPI has a history of noncompliance with the Census Bureau export regulations contained in this part.

      (v) The USPPI has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under investigation for a felony involving a violation of federal export laws or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of probable cause supporting such violation, or the USPPI is in violation of Census Bureau export regulations contained in this part.

      (vi) The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.

      (vii) The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security interests such that its participation in postdeparture filing should be denied.

      (viii) The USPPI has multiple violations of either the EAR (15 CFR 730 through 774) or the ITAR (22 CFR 120 through 130) within the last three (3) years.

      (ix) The USPPI fails to demonstrate the ability to meet the AES predeparture filing requirements.

      (2)  A USPPI denied postdeparture filing privileges by other agencies shall contact those agencies regarding the specific reason(s) for nonselection and for their appeal procedures. A USPPI denied postdeparture filing status by the Census Bureau will be provided with a specific reason for nonselection and a Census Bureau point of contact in an electronic notification letter. A USPPI may appeal the Census Bureau's nonselection decision by following the appeal procedure and reapplication procedure provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

      (3) —(i)  The Census Bureau may revoke postdeparture filing privileges of an approved USPPI for the following reasons:

      (A) The USPPI's volume of EEI reported in the AES does not warrant continued participation in postdeparture filing;

      (B) The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI through the AES in a timely and accurate manner;

      (C) The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to material fact;

      (D) The USPPI submitting the LOI has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under investigation for a felony involving a violation of federal export laws or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of probable cause supporting such violation, or the AES applicant is in violation of export rules and regulations contained in this part;

      (E) The USPPI has failed to comply with existing export regulations or has failed to pay any outstanding penalties assessed in connection with such noncompliance; or

      (F) The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security interests such that its continued participation in postdeparture filing should be terminated.

      (G) The USPPI or its authorized agent files postdeparture for commodities that are identified in § 30.4(a).

      (ii)  Any of the other agencies may revoke a USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges with respect to transactions subject to the jurisdiction of that agency. When doing so, the agency shall notify both the Census Bureau and the USPPI whose authorization is being revoked.

      (4)  Approved postdeparture filing USPPIs whose postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by other agencies shall contact those agencies for their specific revocation and appeal procedures. When the Census Bureau makes a determination to revoke an approved USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges, the USPPI will be notified electronically of the reason(s) for the decision. In most cases, the revocation shall become effective when the USPPI has either exhausted all appeal procedures, or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation, if no appeal is filed. However, in cases judged to affect national security, revocations shall become effective immediately upon notification.

      (5)  Any USPPI whose request for postdeparture filing privileges has been denied by the Census Bureau or whose postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by the Census Bureau may appeal the decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the notice of decision. Appeals should be addressed to the Chief, Foreign Trade Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-6700. The Census Bureau will issue a written decision to the USPPI within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of the appeal by the Census Bureau. If a written decision is not issued within thirty (30) calendar days, the Census Bureau will forward to the USPPI a notice of extension within that time period. The USPPI will be provided with the reasons for the extension of this time period and an expected date of decision. The USPPIs who have had their postdeparture filing status denied or revoked may not reapply for this privilege for one year following written notification of the denial or revocation.

      (d)  The data elements required for filing EEI are contained in § 30.6. When filing EEI, the USPPI or authorized agent shall comply with the data transmission procedures determined by CBP and the Census Bureau and shall agree to stay in complete compliance with all export rules and regulations in this part. Failure of the USPPI or the authorized agent of either the USPPI or FPPI to comply with these requirements constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part, and renders such principal party or the authorized agent subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part. In the case of AES, when submitting a registration form to AES, the registering company is certifying that it will be in compliance with all applicable export rules and regulations. This includes complying with the following security requirements:

      (1) AES user names and passwords are to be kept secure by the account administrator and not disclosed to any unauthorized user or any persons outside the registered company.

      (2) Registered companies are responsible for those persons having a user name and password. If an employee with a user name and password leaves the company or otherwise is no longer an authorized user, the company shall immediately deactivate that username in the system to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of Title 13 data.

      (e)  The USPPI's or the authorized agent's AES filings will be monitored and reviewed for quality, timeliness, and coverage. The Census Bureau will provide performance reports to USPPIs and authorized agents who file EEI. The Census Bureau will take appropriate action to correct specific situations where the USPPI or authorized agent fails to maintain acceptable levels of data quality, timeliness, or coverage.

      (f)  The Census Bureau provides online services that allow the USPPI and the authorized agent to seek assistance pertaining to the AES and this part. For AES assistance, filers may send an email to  For FTR assistance, filers may send an email to

      § 30.6   Electronic Export Information data elements.

#### § § 30.6

      The information specified in this section is required for EEI transmitted to the AES. The data elements identified as “mandatory” shall be reported for each transaction. The data elements identified as “conditional” shall be reported if they are required for or apply to the specific shipment. The data elements identified as “optional” may be reported at the discretion of the USPPI or the authorized agent. Additional data elements may be required to be reported in the AES in accordance with other federal agencies' regulations. Refer to the other agencies' regulations for reporting requirements.

      (a) Mandatory data elements are as follows:

      (1)  The person or legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the export transaction. Generally, that person or entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, or order party, or the foreign entity while in the United States when purchasing or obtaining the goods for export. The name, address, identification number, and contact information of the USPPI shall be reported to the AES as follows:

      (i)  In all export transactions, the name listed in the USPPI field in the EEI shall be the USPPI in the transaction. (See § 30.1 for the definition of the USPPI and § 30.3 for details on the USPPI's reporting responsibilities.)

      (ii)  In all EEI filings, the USPPI shall report the address or location (no post office box number) from which the goods actually begin the journey to the port of export even if the USPPI does not own/lease the facility. For example, the EEI covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show the address of the warehouse in Georgia. For shipments with multiple origins, report the address from which the commodity with the greatest value begins its export journey. If such information is not known, report the address in the state where the commodities are consolidated for export.

      (iii)  Report the Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the USPPI. If the USPPI has only one EIN, report that EIN. If the USPPI has more than one EIN, report the EIN that the USPPI uses to report employee wages and withholdings, and not the EIN used to report only company earnings or receipts. Use of another company's EIN is prohibited. If a USPPI reports a DUNS, the EIN is also required to be reported. If a foreign entity is in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for export, the foreign entity is the USPPI. In such situations, when the foreign entity does not have an EIN, the authorized agent shall report a border crossing number, passport number, or any number assigned by CBP on behalf of the foreign entity.

      (iv)  The person who has the most knowledge regarding the specific shipment or related export controls.

      (2)  The date of export is the date when goods are scheduled to leave the port of export on the exporting carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States.

      (3)  The ultimate consignee is the person, party, or designee that is located abroad and actually receives the export shipment. The name and address of the ultimate consignee, whether by sale in the United States or abroad or by consignment, shall be reported in the EEI. The ultimate consignee as known at the time of export shall be reported. For shipments requiring an export license including shipments to international waters, the ultimate consignee reported in the AES shall be the person so designated on the export license or authorized to be the ultimate consignee under the applicable license exemption or exception in conformance with the EAR or ITAR, as applicable. For goods sold en route, report the appropriate “To be Sold En Route” indicator in the EEI, and report corrected information as soon as it is known (see § 30.9 for procedures on correcting AES information).

      (4)  The U.S. state of origin is the 2-character postal code for the state in which the goods begin their journey to the port of export. For example, a shipment covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show Georgia as the state of origin. The U.S. state of origin may be different from the U.S. state where the goods were produced, mined, or grown. For shipments of multi-state origin, reported as a single shipment, report the U.S. state of the commodity with the greatest value. If such information is not known, report the state in which the commodities are consolidated for export.

      (5)  The country of ultimate destination is the country in which goods are to be consumed, further processed, stored, or manufactured, as known to the USPPI at the time of export. The country of ultimate destination is the code issued by the ISO.

      (i)  For shipments under an export license issued by the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), or the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the country of ultimate destination shall conform to the country of ultimate destination as shown on the license. In the case of a DDTC or BIS license, the country of ultimate destination is the country specified with respect to the end user, which may also be the ultimate consignee. For goods licensed by other government agencies, refer to the agencies' specific requirements for providing country of ultimate destination information.

      (ii)  The country of ultimate destination is the country known to the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent at the time of exportation. The country to which the goods are being shipped is not the country of ultimate destination if the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent has knowledge, at the time the goods leave the United States, that they are intended for reexport or transshipment in the form received to another known country. For goods shipped to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Hong Kong, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, The Netherlands, or Singapore, special care should be exercised before reporting these countries as the ultimate destinations because these are countries through which goods from the United States are frequently transshipped. If the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent does not know the ultimate destination of the goods, the country of ultimate destination to be shown is the last country, as known to the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent at the time the goods leave the United States, to which the goods are to be shipped in their present form. (For instructions as to the reporting of country of ultimate destination for vessels sold or transferred from the United States to foreign ownership, see § 30.26). In addition, the following types of shipments must be reported as follows:

      (A)  The country of ultimate destination is the country specified with respect to the end user as noted in the ITAR (22 CFR 123.9(a)).

      (B)  The country of ultimate destination is the country of the end user as defined in 15 CFR 772.1 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

      (C)  The country of ultimate destination is the nationality of the person(s) or entity assuming control of the good(s) exported to international waters.

      (iii) For goods to be sold en route, report the country of the first port of call and then report corrected information as soon as it is known.

      (6)  The method of transportation is the means by which the goods are exported from the United States.

      (i)  The mode of transportation for aircraft, vessels, or locomotives (railroad stock) transferring ownership or title and moving out of the United States under its own power is the mode of transportation by which the conveyance moves out of the United States.

      (ii)  For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the mode of transportation is the mode of the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States.

      (7)  The conveyance name/carrier name is the name of the conveyance/carrier transporting the goods out of the United States as known at the time of exportation. For exports by sea, the conveyance name is the vessel name. For exports by air, rail, or truck, the carrier name is that which corresponds to the carrier identification as specified in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Terms, such as airplane, train, rail, truck, vessel, barge, or international footbridge are not acceptable. For shipments by other methods of transportation, including mail, fixed methods (pipeline), the conveyance/carrier name is not required.

      (8)  The carrier identification is the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) for vessel, rail, and truck shipments or the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code for air shipments. The carrier identification specifies the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. The carrier transporting the goods to the port of export and the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States may be different. For vessel shipments, report the carrier identification code of the party whose booking number was reported in the AES. For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the carrier identification is that of the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. For modes other than vessel, air, rail and truck valid methods of transportation, including but not limited to mail, fixed transport (pipeline), and passenger hand carried, the carrier identification is not required. The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) issues and maintains the SCAC. (See ) The IATA issues and maintains the IATA codes. (See  for a list of IATA codes.)

      (9)  The port of export is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seaport or airport where the goods are loaded on the carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States, or the CBP port where exports by overland transportation cross the U.S. border into Canada or Mexico. For EEI reporting purposes only, for goods loaded aboard a conveyance (aircraft or vessel) that stops at several ports before clearing to the foreign country, the port of export is the first port where the goods were loaded on this conveyance. For goods off-loaded from the original conveyance to another conveyance (even if the aircraft or vessel belongs to the same carrier) at any of the ports, the port where the goods were loaded on the last conveyance before going foreign is the port of export. The port of export shall be reported in terms of Schedule D, “Classification of CBP Districts and Ports.” Use port code 8000 for shipments by mail.

      (10)  Used to indicate when a transaction involving trade between a USPPI and an ultimate consignee where either party owns directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the other party.

      (11)  Indicates if the goods exported are of domestic or foreign origin. Report foreign goods as a separate line item from domestic goods even if the commodity classification number is the same.

      (12)  Report the 10-digit commodity classification number as provided in Schedule B,  in the EEI. The 10-digit commodity classification number provided in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUSA) may be reported in lieu of the Schedule B commodity classification number except as noted in the headnotes of the HTSUSA. The HTSUSA is a global classification system used to describe most world trade in goods. Furnishing the correct Schedule B or HTSUSA number does not relieve the USPPI or the authorized agent of furnishing a complete and accurate commodity description. When reporting the Schedule B number or HTSUSA number, the decimals shall be omitted. (See  for a list of Schedule B classification numbers.)

      (13)  Report the description of the goods shipped in English in sufficient detail to permit verification of the Schedule B or HTSUSA number. Clearly and fully state the name of the commodity in terms that can be identified or associated with the language used in Schedule B or HTSUSA (usually the commercial name of the commodity), and any and all characteristics of the commodity that distinguish it from commodities of the same name covered by other Schedule B or HTSUSA classifications. If the shipment requires a license, the description reported in the EEI shall conform with that shown on the license. If the shipment qualifies for a license exemption, the description shall be sufficient to ensure compliance with that license exemption. However, where the description on the license does not state all of the characteristics of the commodity that are needed to completely verify the commodity classification number, as described in this paragraph, report the missing characteristics, as well as the description shown on the license, in the commodity description field of the EEI.

      (14)  The unit of measure shall correspond to the primary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. If neither Schedule B nor HTSUSA specifies a unit of measure for the item, an “X” is required in the unit of measure field.

      (15)  The quantity is the total number of units that correspond to the first unit of measure specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. Where the unit of measure is in terms of weight (grams, kilograms, metric tons, etc.), the quantity reflects the net weight, not including the weight of barrels, boxes, or other bulky coverings, and not including salt or pickle in the case of salted or pickled fish or meats. For a few commodities where “content grams” or “content kilograms” or some similar weight unit is specified in Schedule B or HTSUSA, the quantity may be less than the net weight. The quantity is reported as a whole unit only, without commas or decimals. If the quantity contains a fraction of a whole unit, round fractions of one-half unit or more up and fractions of less than one-half unit down to the nearest whole unit. (For example, where the unit for a given commodity is in terms of “tons,” a net quantity of 8.4 tons would be reported as 8 for the quantity. If the quantity is less than one unit, the quantity is 1.)

      (16)  The shipping weight is the weight in kilograms, which includes the weight of the commodity, as well as the weight of normal packaging, such as boxes, crates, barrels, etc. The shipping weight is required for exports by air, vessel, rail, and truck, and required for exports of household goods transported by all methods. For exports (except household goods) by mail, fixed transport (pipeline), or other valid methods, the shipping weight is not required and shall be reported as zero. For containerized cargo in lift vans, cargo vans, or similar substantial outer containers, the weight of such containers is not included in the shipping weight. If the shipping weight is not available for each Schedule B or HTSUSA item included in one or more containers, the approximate shipping weight for each item is estimated and reported. The total of these estimated weights equals the actual shipping weight of the entire container or containers.

      (17)  In general, the value to be reported in the EEI shall be the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export in U.S. dollars. The value shall be the selling price (or the cost, if the goods are not sold), plus inland or domestic freight, insurance, and other charges to the U.S. seaport, airport, or land border port of export. Cost of goods is the sum of expenses incurred in the USPPI's acquisition or production of the goods. Report the value to the nearest dollar, omit cents. Fractions of a dollar less than 50 cents should be ignored, and fractions of 50 cents or more should be rounded up to the next dollar.

      (i)  The selling price for goods exported pursuant to sale, and the value to be reported in the EEI, is the USPPI's price to the FPPI (the foreign buyer). Deduct from the selling price any unconditional discounts, but do not deduct discounts that are conditional upon a particular act or performance on the part of the foreign buyer. For goods shipped on consignment without a sale actually having been made at the time of export, the selling price to be reported in the EEI is the market value at the time of export at the U.S. port.

      (ii)  When necessary, make the following adjustments to obtain the value.

      (A) Where goods are sold at a point other than the port of export, freight, insurance, and other charges required in moving the goods from their U.S. point of origin to the exporting carrier at the port of export or border crossing point shall be added to the selling price (as defined in paragraph (a)(17)(i) of this section) for purposes of reporting the value in the EEI.

      (B) Where the actual amount of freight, insurance, and other domestic costs is not available, an estimate of the domestic costs shall be made and added to the cost of the goods or selling price to derive the value to be reported in the EEI. Add the estimated domestic costs to the cost or selling price of the goods to obtain the value to be reported in the EEI.

      (C) Where goods are sold at a “delivered” price to the foreign destination, the cost of loading the goods on the exporting carrier, if any, and freight, insurance, and other costs beyond the port of export shall be subtracted from the selling price for purposes of reporting value in the EEI. If the actual amount of such costs is not available, an estimate of the costs should be subtracted from the selling price.

      (D) Costs added to or subtracted from the selling price in accordance with the instructions in this paragraph (a)(17)(ii) should not be shown separately in the EEI, but the value reported should be the value after making such adjustments, where required, to arrive at the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export.

      (iii)  Exclude the following from the selling price of goods exported.

      (A) Commissions to be paid by the USPPI to its agent abroad or commissions to be deducted from the selling price by the USPPI's agent abroad.

      (B) The cost of loading goods on the exporting carrier at the port of export.

      (C) Freight, insurance, and any other charges or transportation costs beyond the port of export.

      (D) Any duties, taxes, or other assessments imposed by foreign countries.

      (iv) For definitions of the value to be reported in the EEI for special types of transactions where goods are not being exported pursuant to commercial sales, or where subsidies, government financing or participation, or other unusual conditions are involved, see Subpart C of this part.

      (18)  A code that identifies the type of export shipment or condition of the exported items (e.g., goods donated for relief or charity, impelled shipments, shipments under the Foreign Military Sales program, household goods, and all other shipments).

      (19)  A unique identification number assigned by the filer that allows for the identification of the shipment in the filer's system. The reuse of the SRN is prohibited.

      (20)  A number that identifies the specific commodity line item within a shipment.

      (21)  An indicator that identifies whether the shipment is hazardous as defined by the Department of Transportation.

      (22)  The code indicating whether the shipment is being transported under bond.

      (23)  The code that identifies the commodity as having a federal government agency requirement for a license, permit, authorization, license exception or exemption or that no license is required.

      (24)  An indicator that identifies that the shipment is a routed export transaction as defined in § 30.3.

      (25)  An indicator that allows the filer to add, change, replace, or cancel an export shipment transaction.

      (26)  An indicator that allows the filer to add, change, or delete a commodity line within an export shipment transaction.

      (27)  An indicator of whether the filer is reporting export information predeparture or postdeparture. See § 30.4 for more information on EEI filing options.

      (28)  Provide the business function of the ultimate consignee that most often applies. If more than one type applies to the ultimate consignee, report the type that applies most often. For purposes of this paragraph, the ultimate consignee will be designated as a Direct Consumer, Government Entity, Reseller, or Other/Unknown, defined as follows:

      (i) Direct Consumer—a non-government institution, enterprise, or company that will consume or use the exported good as a consumable, for its own internal processes, as an input to the production of another good or as machinery or equipment that is part of a manufacturing process or a provision of services and will not resell or distribute the good.

      (ii) Government Entity—a government-owned or government-controlled agency, institution, enterprise, or company.

      (iii) Reseller—a non-government reseller, retailer, wholesaler, distributor, distribution center or trading company.

      (iv) Other/Unknown—an entity that is not a Direct Consumer, Government Entity or Reseller, as defined above, or whose ultimate consignee type is not known at the time of export.

      (b) Conditional data elements are as follows:

      (1)  The authorized agent is the person or entity in the United States who is authorized by the USPPI or the FPPI to prepare and file the EEI or the person or entity, if any, named on the export license. If an authorized agent is used, the following information shall be provided to the AES:

      (i)  Report the U.S. authorized agent's own EIN or DUNS for the first shipment and for each subsequent shipment. Use of another company's or individual's EIN or other identification number is prohibited. The party ID type of agent identification (E = EIN, D = DUNS) shall be indicated.

      (ii)  Report the name of the authorized agent. (See § 30.3 for details on the specific reporting responsibilities of authorized agents and Subpart B of this part for export control licensing requirements for authorized agents.)

      (iii)  Report the address or location (no post office box number) of the authorized agent. The authorized agent's address shall be reported with the initial shipment. Subsequent shipments may be identified by the agent's identification number.

      (iv)  Report the contact name and telephone number.

      (2)  The name and address of the intermediate consignee (if any) shall be reported. The intermediate consignee acts in a foreign country as an agent for the principal party in interest or the ultimate consignee for the purpose of effecting delivery of the export shipment to the ultimate consignee. The intermediate consignee is the person named as such on the export license or authorized to act as such under the applicable general license and in conformity with the EAR.

      (3)  If goods are removed from a FTZ and not entered for consumption, report the _FTZ identifier._ This is the unique 9-digit alphanumeric identifier assigned by the Foreign Trade Zone Board that identifies the FTZ, subzone or site from which goods are withdrawn for export.

      (4)  The foreign port of unlading is the foreign port in the country where the goods are removed from the exporting carrier. The foreign port does not have to be located in the country of destination. For exports by sea to foreign countries, not including Puerto Rico, the foreign port of unlading is the code in terms of Schedule K,  For exports by sea or air between the United States and Puerto Rico, the foreign port of unlading is the code in terms of Schedule D,  The foreign port of unlading is not required for exports by other modes of transportation, including rail, truck, mail, fixed (pipeline), or air (unless between the U.S. and Puerto Rico).

      (5)  License number, permit number, citation, or authorization number assigned by the Department of Commerce, BIS; Department of State, DDTC; Department of the Treasury, OFAC; Department of Justice, DEA; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; or any other federal government agency.

      (6)  The number used to identify items on the CCL, Supplement No. 1 to Part 774 of the EAR. The ECCN consists of a set of digits and a letter. Items that are not classified under an ECCN are designated “EAR99”.

      (7)  The unit of measure that corresponds to the secondary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. If neither Schedule B nor HTSUSA specifies a secondary unit of measure for the item, the unit of measure is not required.

      (8)  The total number of units that correspond to the secondary unit of measure, if any, specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. See the definition of primary quantity for specific instructions on reporting the quantity as a weight and whole unit, rounding fractions.

      (9)  The identification number found on the reported used vehicle. For used self-propelled vehicles that do not have a VIN, the Product ID is reported. “Used” vehicle refers to any self-propelled vehicle where the equitable or legal title to which has been transferred by a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser. See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 192.1 for more information on exports of used vehicles.

      (10)  The qualifier that identifies the type of used vehicle number reported. The valid codes are V for VIN and P for Product ID.

      (11)  The number issued by the Motor Vehicle Administration.

      (12)  The 2-character postal code for the state or territory that issued the vehicle title.

      (13)  The entry number must be reported for goods that are entered in lieu of being transported under bond for which the importer of record is a foreign entity or, for reexports of goods withdrawn from a FTZ for which a NAFTA deferred duty claim (entry type 08) could have been made, but that the importer elected to enter for consumption under CBP entry type 06. For goods imported into the United States for export to a third country of ultimate destination, where the importer of record on the entry is a foreign entity, the USPPI will be the authorized agent designated by the foreign importer for service of process. The USPPI, in this circumstance, is required to report the import entry number.

      (14)  The TRN is as follows:

      (i)  Report the booking number for vessel shipments. The booking number is the reservation number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the vessel for cargo being exported. The TRN is required for all vessel shipments.

      (ii)  Report the master air waybill number for air shipments. The air waybill number is the reservation number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the aircraft for cargo being exported. The TRN is optional for air shipments.

      (iii)  Report the bill of lading (BL) number for rail shipments. The BL number is the reservation number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the rail car for cargo being exported. The TRN is optional for rail shipments.

      (iv)  Report the freight or pro bill number for truck shipments. The freight or pro bill number is the number assigned by the carrier to hold space on the truck for cargo being exported. The freight or pro bill number correlates to a bill of lading number, air waybill number or trip number for multimodal shipments. The TRN is optional for truck shipments.

      (15)  For shipments requiring an export license, report the value designated on the export license that corresponds to the commodity being exported.

      (16)  (i)  The number assigned by the DDTC to persons who are required to register per part 122 of the ITAR (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), and have an authorization (license or exemption) from DDTC to export the article.

      (ii)  A term used to designate articles on the USML (22 CFR part 121) for which special export controls are warranted because of their capacity for substantial military utility or capability. See sections 120.36 and 120.10(c) of the ITAR (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) for a definition of SME and for items designated as SME articles, respectively.

      (iii)  Certification by the U.S. exporter that the exporter is an eligible party to participate in defense trade. See 22 CFR 120.16(c). This certification is required only when an exemption is claimed.

      (iii)  Certification by the U.S. exporter that the exporter is an eligible party to participate in defense trade. See 22 CFR 120.1(c). This certification is required only when an exemption is claimed.

      (iv)  The USML category of the article being exported (22 CFR part 121).

      (v)  This unit of measure is the UOM covering the article being shipped as described on the export authorization or declared under an ITAR exemption.

      (vi)  This quantity is the number of articles being shipped. The quantity is the total number of units that corresponds to the DDTC UOM code.

      (vii)  The exemption number is the specific citation from the ITAR (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) that exempts the shipment from the requirements for a license or other written authorization from DDTC.

      (viii)  The line number of the State Department export license that corresponds to the article being exported.

      (ix)  The unique number issued by DDTC to a member of the regulated community (usually the original equipment manufacturer) in conjunction with a notification that a specific commodity is described in USML Category XXI. This number is required only when citing USML Category XXI as an export classification and is used to confirm that an authoritative USML Category XXI determination is being referenced to do so.

      (17)  The unique identifying number on the KPC issued by the United States Kimberley Process Authority that must accompany all export shipments of rough diamonds. Rough diamonds are classified under 6-digit HS subheadings 7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31. Enter the KPC number in the license number field excluding the 2-digit ISO country code for the United States.

      § 30.7   Annotating the bill of lading, air waybill, or other commercial loading documents with proof of filing citations, and exemption legends.

#### § § 30.7

      (a) Items identified on the USML shall meet the predeparture reporting requirements identified in the ITAR (22 CFR 120 through 130) for the U.S. State Department requirements concerning the time and place of filing. For USML shipments, the proof of filing citations shall include the statement in “AES,” followed by the returned confirmation number provided by the AES when the transmission is accepted, referred to as the ITN.

      (b) For shipments other than USML, the USPPI or the authorized agent is responsible for annotating the proper proof of filing citation or exemption legend on the first page of the bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions or other commercial loading documents. The USPPI or the authorized agent must provide the proof of filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier. The carrier must annotate the proof of filing citation, exemption or exclusion legends on the carrier's outbound manifest when required. The carrier is responsible for presenting the appropriate proof of filing citation or exemption legend to CBP Port Director at the port of export as stated in subpart E of this part. Such presentation shall be without material change or amendment of the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, or exemption legend as provided to the carrier by the USPPI or the authorized agent. The proof of filing citation will identify that the export information has been accepted as transmitted. The postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, or exemption legend will identify that no filing is required prior to export. The proof of filing citations, postdeparture filing citations, or exemption legends shall appear on the bill of lading, air waybill or other commercial loading documentation and shall be clearly visible. The AES filing citation, exemption or exclusion legends are provided for in appendix B of this part. The exporting carrier shall annotate the manifest or other carrier documentation with the AES filing citations, exemption or exclusions legends.

      (c) Exports of rough diamonds classified under HS subheadings 7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31 require the proof of filing citation, as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, to be indicated on the Kimberley Process Certificate (KPC). In addition, the KPC must be faxed by the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent to the Census Bureau on (800) 457-7328, or provided by other methods as permitted by the Census Bureau, immediately after export of the shipment from the United States.

      § 30.8   Time and place for presenting proof of filing citations and exemption legends.

#### § § 30.8

      The following conditions govern the time and place to present proof of filing citations, postdeparture filing citations, AES downtime filing citation, exemption, or exclusion legends. The USPPI or the authorized agent is required to deliver the proof of filing citations, postdeparture filing citations, AES downtime filing citations, exemption, or exclusion legends required in § 30.7 to the exporting carrier. See appendix B of this part for the properly formatted proof of filing citations, exemption, or exclusion legends. Failure of the USPPI or the authorized agent of either the USPPI or FPPI to comply with these requirements constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part and renders such principal party or the authorized agent subject to the penalties provided for in subpart H of this part.

      (a)  The proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption and/or exclusion legend for items exported by mail as required in § 30.4(b) shall be annotated on the appropriate U.S. Postal Service customs declaration form (and/or its electronic equivalent) and presented with the packages at the time of mailing. The Postal Service is required to deliver the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend prior to export.

      (b)  The proof of filing citations or exemption and exclusion legends for items being sent by pipeline shall be presented to the operator of a pipeline no later than four calendar days after the close of the month. See § 30.4(c)(2) for requirements for the filing of export information by pipeline carriers.

      (c)  For exports sent other than by mail or pipeline, the USPPI or the authorized agent is required to deliver the proof of filing citations and/or exemption and exclusion legends to the exporting carrier in accord with the time periods set forth in § 30.4(b).

      § 30.9   Transmitting and correcting Electronic Export Information.

#### § § 30.9

      (a) The USPPI or the authorized filing agent is responsible for electronically transmitting accurate EEI as known at the time of filing in the AES and transmitting any changes to that information as soon as they are known. Corrections, cancellations, or amendments to that information shall be electronically identified and transmitted to the AES for all required fields as soon as possible. The provisions of this paragraph relating to the reporting of corrections, cancellations, or amendments to EEI, shall not be construed as a relaxation of the requirements of the rules and regulations pertaining to the preparation and filing of EEI. Failure to correct the EEI is a violation of the provisions of this part.

      (b) For shipments where the USPPI or the authorized agent has received an error message from AES, the corrections shall take place as required. Fatal error messages are sent to filers when EEI is not accepted in the AES and update rejected messages are sent when a correction is not accepted in the AES. Fatal errors must be corrected and EEI resubmitted prior to export for shipments filed predeparture and for post-departure shipments but not later than five (5) calendar days after the date of export. Failure to respond to fatal error messages for shipments filed predeparture prior to export of the cargo subjects the principal party or authorized agent to penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part. Failing to transmit corrections to the AES constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part and renders such principal party or authorized agent subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part. Update rejected messages must be corrected as soon as possible. For EEI that generates a warning message, the correction shall be made within four (4) calendar days of receipt of the original transmission. For EEI that generates a verify message, the correction, when warranted, shall be made within four (4) calendar days of receipt of the message. A compliance alert indicates that the shipment was not reported in accordance with the FTR. The USPPI or the authorized agent is required to review its filing practices and take required corrective actions to conform with export reporting requirements.

      § 30.10   Retention of export information and the authority to require production of documents.

#### § § 30.10

      (a)  All parties to the export transaction (owners and operators of export carriers, USPPIs, FPPIs and/or authorized agents) shall retain documents pertaining to the export shipment for five years from the date of export. If the Department of State or other regulatory agency has recordkeeping requirements for exports that exceed the retention period specified in this part, then those requirements prevail. The USPPI or the authorized agent of the USPPI or FPPI may request a copy of the electronic record or submission from the Census Bureau as provided for in Subpart G of this part. The Census Bureau's retention and maintenance of AES records does not relieve filers from requirements in § 30.10.

      (b)  For purposes of verifying the completeness and accuracy of information reported as required under § 30.6, and for other purposes under the regulations in this part, all parties to the export transaction (owners and operators of the exporting carriers, USPPIs, FPPIs, and/or authorized agents) shall provide upon request to the Census Bureau, CBP, ICE, BIS and other participating agencies EEI, shipping documents, invoices, orders, packing lists, and correspondence as well as any other relevant information bearing upon a specific export transaction at anytime within the five year time period.

      § 30.15   Introduction.

#### § § 30.15

      (a) For export shipments to foreign countries, the EEI is used both for statistical and for export control purposes. All parties to an export transaction must comply with all relevant export control regulations, as well as the requirements of the statistical regulations of this part. For convenience, references to provisions of the EAR, ITAR, CBP, and OFAC regulations that affect the statistical reporting requirements of this part have been incorporated into this part. For regulations and information concerning other agencies that exercise export control and licensing authority for particular types of commodity shipments, a USPPI, its authorized agent, or other party to the transaction shall consult the appropriate agency regulations.

      (b) In addition to the reporting requirements set forth in § 30.6, further information may be required for export control purposes by the regulations of CBP, BIS, State Department, or the U.S. Postal Service under particular circumstances.

      (c) This part requires the retention of documents or records pertaining to a shipment for five years from the date of export. All records concerning license exceptions or license exemptions shall be retained in the format (including electronic or hard copy) required by the controlling agency's regulations. For information on recordkeeping retention requirements exceeding the requirements of this part, refer to the regulations of the agency exercising export control authority for the specific shipment.

      (d) In accordance with the provisions of Subpart G of this part, information from the EEI is used solely for official purposes, as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce, and any unauthorized use is not permitted.

      § 30.16   Export Administration Regulations.

#### § § 30.16

      The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, BIS, contain additional reporting requirements pertaining to EEI (see 15 CFR parts 730-774).

      (a) The EAR requires that export information be filed for shipments from U.S. Possessions to foreign countries or areas. (see 15 CFR 758.1(b) and 772.1, definition of the United States.)

      (c) Requirements to place certain export control information on export control documents for shipments exempt from AES filing requirements. (See 15 CFR 758.1(d)).

      (d) A shipment destined for a country listed in Country Group E:1 or E:2 as set forth in Supplement No. 1 to 15 CFR part 740 shall require EEI filings regardless of value unless such shipment is eligible for an exemption in § 30.37(y) and does not require a license by BIS or any other Federal Government Agency.

      (e) Goods licensed by BIS where the country of ultimate destination is the United States or goods destined to international waters where the person(s) or entity assuming control of the item(s) is a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States or a juridical entity organized under the laws of the United States or a jurisdiction within the United States shall be excluded from EEI filing.

      Special procedures govern the values to be reported for shipments of the following unusual types:

      (a)  Where provision is made for the payment to the USPPI for the exportation of agricultural commodities under a program of the Department of Agriculture, the value required to be reported for EEI is the selling price paid by the foreign buyer minus the subsidy.

      (b)  For exports of GSA excess personal property, the value to be shown in the EEI will be “fair market value,” plus charges when applicable, at which the property was transferred to GSA by the holding agency. These charges include packing, rehabilitation, inland freight, or drayage. The estimated “fair market value” may be zero, or it may be a percentage of the original or estimated acquisition costs. (Bill of lading, air waybill, and other commercial loading documents for such shipments will bear the notation “Excess Personal Property, GSA Regulations 1-III, 303.03.”)

      (c)  For imported goods that are cleared by CBP but subsequently rejected, an EEI must be filed to export the goods. The value to be reported in the AES is the declared import value of the goods.

      § 30.26   Reporting of vessels, aircraft, cargo vans, and other carriers and containers.

#### § § 30.26

      (a) Export information shall be filed in the AES for all vessels, locomotives, aircraft, rail cars, trucks, other vehicles, trailers, pallets, cargo vans, lift vans, or similar shipping containers when these items are moving as goods pursuant to sale or other transfer from ownership in the United States to ownership abroad. If the vessel, car, aircraft, locomotive, rail car, vehicle, or shipping container is outside Customs territory of the United States at the time of sale or transfer to foreign ownership, EEI shall be reported identifying the last port of clearance or departure from the United States prior to sale or transfer. The date of export shall be the date of sale.

      (b) The country of destination to be shown in the EEI for vessels sold foreign is the country of new ownership. The country for which the vessel clears, or the country of registry of the vessel, should not be reported as the country of destination in the EEI unless such country is the country of new ownership.

      § 30.28   Split shipments.

#### § § 30.28

      A split shipment is a shipment covered by a single EEI record booked for export on one conveyance that is divided for shipment on more than one conveyance by the exporting carrier prior to export. The exporting carrier must file the manifest in accordance with CBP regulations indicating that the cargo was sent on two or more of the same type of conveyance of the same carrier leaving from the same port of export within 24 hours by vessel or 7 days by air, truck, or rail. For the succeeding parts of the shipment that are exported within the time frames specified above, a new EEI record will not be required. However, for the succeeding parts of the shipment that are not exported within the time frames specified above, a new EEI record must be filed and amendments must be made to the original EEI record. If a new EEI record is required, the original ITN data element may be used. The following procedures apply for split shipments:

      (a) The carrier shall submit the manifest to the CBP Port Director with the manifest covering the conveyance on which the first part of the split shipment is exported and shall make no changes to the EEI. However, the manifest shall show in the “number of packages” column the actual portion of the declared total quantity being carried and shall carry a notation to indicate “Split Shipment” e.g., “3 of 10—Split Shipment.” All associated manifests with the notation “Split Shipment” will have identical ITNs if exported within 24 hours by vessel or 7 days by air, truck, or rail.

      (b) On each subsequent manifest covering a conveyance on which any part of a split shipment is exported, a prominent notation “SPLIT SHIPMENT”, e.g. “4 of 10—Split shipment” shall be made on the manifest for identification. On the last shipment, the notation shall read “SPLIT SHIPMENT, FINAL, e.g., “10 of 10 Split Shipment, Final”.” Each subsequent manifest covering a part of a split shipment shall also show in the “number of packages” column only the goods carried on that particular conveyance and a reference to the total number originally declared for export (for example, 5 of 11, or 5/11). Immediately following the line showing the portion of the split shipment carried on that conveyance, a notation will be made showing the bill of lading number, air waybill number, or other commercial loading documents shown in the original EEI and the portions of the originally declared total carried on each previous conveyance, together with the number and date of each such previous conveyance.

#### § § 30.29

      These guidelines will govern the reporting of the following:

      (a) The return of goods previously imported only for repair and alteration.

      (1) The return of goods not licensed by a U.S. Government agency and not subject to the ITAR, temporarily imported for repair and alternation, and declared as such on importation shall have Schedule B number 9801.10.0000. The value shall only include parts and labor. The value of the original product shall not be included. If the value of the parts and labor is over $2,500, then EEI must be filed.

      (2) The return of goods licensed by a U.S. Government agency or subject to the ITAR, temporarily imported for repair or alteration, and declared as such on importation shall have Schedule B number 9801.10.0000. In the value field, report the value of the parts and labor. In the license value field, report the value designated on the export license that corresponds to the commodity being exported if required by the licensing agency. EEI must be filed regardless of value.

      (b)  (1) Goods that are reexported after repair under warranty shall follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section as appropriate. It is recommended that the bill of lading, air waybill, or other loading documents include the statement, “This product was repaired under warranty.”

      (2) Goods that are replaced under warranty at no charge to the customer shall include the statement, “Product replaced under warranty, value for EEI purposes” on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other commercial loading documents. Place the notation below the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend on the commercial loading documents. Report the Schedule B number or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) commodity classification number of the replacement parts. For goods not licensed by a U.S. Government agency, report the value of the replacement parts in accordance with § 30.6(a)(17). For goods licensed by a U.S. Government agency, report the value and license value in accordance with § 30.6(a)(17) and § 30.6(b)(15) respectively.

      § 30.37   Miscellaneous exemptions.

#### § § 30.37

      Except as noted in § 30.2(a)(1)(iv), filing EEI is not required for the following kinds of shipments. However, the Census Bureau has the authority to periodically require the reporting of shipments that are normally exempt from filing.

      (a) Exports of commodities where the value of the commodities shipped from one USPPI to one consignee on a single exporting conveyance, classified under an individual Schedule B number or HTSUSA commodity classification code is $2,500 or less. This exemption applies to individual Schedule B numbers or HTSUSA commodity classification codes regardless of the total shipment value. In instances where a shipment contains a mixture of individual Schedule B numbers or HTSUSA commodity classification codes valued at $2,500 or less and individual Schedule B numbers or HTSUSA commodity classification codes valued over $2,500, only those Schedule B numbers or HTSUSA commodity classification codes valued over $2,500 are required to be reported. If the filer reports multiple items of the same Schedule B number or HTSUSA commodity classification code, this exemption only applies if the total value of exports for the Schedule B number or HTSUSA commodity classification code is $2,500 or less. Items of domestic and foreign origin under the same commodity classification number must be reported separately and EEI filing is required when either is over $2,500. For the reporting of household goods see § 30.38.  this exemption does not apply to the export of vehicles. The export information for vehicles must be filed in AES regardless of value or country of destination.

      (b) Tools of trade and their containers that are usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of commodities and software intended for use by individual USPPIs or by employees or representatives of the exporting company in furthering the enterprises and undertakings of the USPPI abroad. Commodities and software eligible for this exemption are those that do not require an export license or that are exported as tools of the trade under a license exception of the EAR (15 CFR 740.9), and are subject to the following provisions:

      (1) Are owned by the individual USPPI or exporting company.

      (2) Accompany the individual USPPI, employee, or representative of the exporting company.

      (3) Are necessary and appropriate and intended for the personal and/or business use of the individual USPPI, employee, or representative of the company or business.

      (4) Are not for sale.

      (5) Are returned to the United States no later than one (1) year from the date of export.

      (6) Are not shipped under a bill of lading or an air waybill.

      (c) Shipments from one point in the United States to another point in the United States by routes passing through Canada or Mexico.

      (d) Shipments from one point in Canada or Mexico to another point in the same country by routes through the United States.

      (e) [Reserved]

      (f) Exports of technology and software as defined in 15 CFR 772 of the EAR that do not require an export license are exempt from filing requirements. However, EEI is required for mass-market software. For purposes of this part, mass-market software is defined as software that is generally available to the public by being sold at retail selling points, or directly from the software developer or supplier, by means of over-the-counter transactions, mail-order transactions, telephone transactions, or electronic mail-order transactions, and designed for installation by the user without further substantial technical support by the developer or supplier.

      (g) Shipments of books, maps, charts, pamphlets, and similar articles to foreign libraries, government establishments, or similar institutions.

      (h) Shipments as authorized under License Exception GFT for gift parcels and humanitarian donations (15 CFR 740.12(a) and (b)).

      (i) Diplomatic pouches and their contents.

      (j) Human remains and accompanying appropriate receptacles and flowers.

      § 30.54   Special provisions for imports from Canada.

#### § § 30.54

      (a) When certain softwood lumber products described under HTSUSA subheadings 4407.1001, 4409.1010, 4409.1090, and 4409.1020 are imported from Canada, import entry records are required to show a valid Canadian region of manufacture code. The Canadian region of manufacture is determined on a first mill basis (the point at which the item was first manufactured into a covered lumber product). Canadian region of manufacture is the first region where the subject goods underwent a change in tariff classification to the tariff classes cited in this paragraph. The Canadian region code should be transmitted in the electronic ABI summaries. The Canadian region of manufacture code should replace the region of origin code on CBP-7501, entry summary form. These requirements apply only for imports of certain softwood lumber products for which the region of origin is Canada.

      (b) All other imports from Canada, including certain softwood lumber products not covered in paragraph (a) of this section, will require the two letter designation of the Canadian province of origin to be reported on U.S. entry summary records. This information is required only for U.S. imports that under applicable CBP rules of origin are determined to originate in Canada. For nonmanufactured goods determined to be of Canadian origin, the province of origin is defined as the region where the exported goods were originally grown, mined, or otherwise produced. For goods of Canadian origin that are manufactured or assembled in Canada, with the exception of the certain softwood lumber products described in paragraph (a) of this section, the region of origin is that in which the final manufacture or assembly is performed prior to exporting that good to the United States. In cases where the region in which the goods were manufactured, assembled, grown, mined, or otherwise produced is unknown, the province in which the Canadian vendor is located can be reported. For those reporting on paper forms the region of origin code replaces the country of origin code on CBP Form 7501, entry summary form.

      (c) All electronic ABI entry summaries for imports originating in Canada also require the Canadian region of origin code to be transmitted for each entry summary line item.

      (d) The region of origin code replaces the region of origin code only for imports that have been determined, under applicable CBP rules, to originate in Canada. Valid Canadian region/territory codes are:

#### § § 30.55

      The contents of the statistical copies of import entries and withdrawals on file with the Census Bureau are treated as confidential and will not be released without authorization by CBP, in accordance with 19 CFR part 103 relating to the copies on file in CBP offices. The importer or import broker must provide the Census Bureau with information or documentation necessary to verify the accuracy or resolve problems regarding the reported import transaction.

      (a) The basic responsibility for obtaining and providing the information required by the general statistical headnotes of the HTSUSA rests with the person filing the import entry. This is provided for in section 484(a) of the Tariff Act, 19 CFR 141.61(e) of CBP regulations, and § 30.50 of this subpart. CBP Regulations 19 CFR 141.61(a) specify that the entry summary data clearly set forth all information required.

      (b) 19 CFR 141.61(e) of CBP regulations provides that penalty procedures relating to erroneous statistical information shall not be invoked against any person who attempts to comply with the statistical requirements of the General Statistical Notes of the HTSUSA. However, in those instances where there is evidence that statistical suffixes are misstated to avoid quota action, or a misstatement of facts is made to avoid import controls or restrictions related to specific commodities, the importer or its licensed broker should be aware that the appropriate actions will be taken under 19 U.S.C. 1592, as amended.

      § 30.60   Confidentiality of Electronic Export Information.

#### § § 30.60

      (a) The Electronic Export Information (EEI) collected and accessed by the Census Bureau under 15 CFR Part 30 is confidential, to be used solely for official purposes as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce. The collection of EEI by the Department of Commerce has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collected is used by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes. In addition, EEI is used by federal government agencies, such as the Department of State, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for export control; by other federal government agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bureau of Transportation Statistics for statistical purposes; and by other federal agencies as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce or the Census Bureau Director consistent with the agencies' statutory or legal authorities as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section. Absent such authorization, information collected pursuant to this Part shall not be disclosed to anyone by any officer, employee, contractor, agent of the federal government or other parties with access to the EEI other than to the USPPI or the authorized agent of the USPPI. Such disclosure shall be limited to that information provided by each party pursuant to this Part.

      (b)  (1) The EEI may be viewed and used by federal agencies authorized to use export data for official purposes as defined to include, but not limited to:

      (i) Improving compliance with U.S. export laws and regulations;

      (ii) Detecting and preventing violations of export, census, customs, homeland security, national resource and other laws, regulations and treaties;

      (iii) Analysis to assess threats to U.S. and international security such as money laundering, and other potential violations of U.S. and foreign criminal laws;

      (iv) Enforcement of U.S. export-related laws and regulations;

      (v) Investigation and prosecution of possible violations of U.S. export-related laws and regulations;

      (vi) Proof of export for enforcement of laws relating to exemption from or refund, drawback or other return of taxes, duties, fees or other charges;

      (vii) Analyzing the impact of proposed and implemented trade agreeements and fulfilling U.S. obligations under such agreements; and

      (viii) Preparation of statistics.

      (2) The Census Bureau may provide the EEI to the USPPI or authorized agent, for compliance and audit purposes. Such disclosure shall be limited to that information provided to the AES by the USPPI or the authorized agent.

      (c)  The official report of the EEI submitted to the U.S. government shall not be disclosed by the USPPI, the authorized agent, or representative of the USPPI for “nonofficial purposes,” either in whole or in part, or in any form including but not limited to electronic transmission, paper printout, or certified reproduction. “Nonofficial purposes” are defined to include but not limited to providing the official EEI:

      (1) In support of claims for exemption from Federal or state taxation, except as related to paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section;

      (2) To the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for purposes not related to export control or compliance;

      (3) To state and local government agencies, and nongovernmental entities or individuals for any purpose; and

      (4) To foreign entities or foreign governments for any purpose.

      (d) Ocean manifest data can be made public under provision of CBP regulations. For information appearing on the outward manifest, 19 CFR 103.31 allows a shipper (or their authorized employee or official) to submit a certification for confidential treatment of the shipper's name and address.

      (e)  Under 13 U.S.C. 301(g), the EEI collected and accessed by the Census Bureau is exempt from public disclosure unless the Secretary or delegate determines that such exemption would be contrary to the national interest. The Secretary or delegate may make such information available, if he or she determines it is in the national interest, taking such safeguards and precautions to limit dissemination as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. In determining whether it is contrary to the national interest to apply the exemption, the maintenance of confidentiality and national security shall be considered as important elements of national interest. The unauthorized disclosure of confidential EEI granted under a National Interest Determination renders such persons subject to the civil penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.

      (f)  Disclosure of confidential EEI by any officer, employee, contractor, or agent of the federal government, except as provided for in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section renders such persons subject to the civil penalties.

      (b) —(1)  A failure to file violation occurs if the government discovers that there is no AES record for an export transaction by the applicable period prescribed in § 30.4 of this part. Any AES record filed later than ten (10) calendar days after the due date will also be considered a failure to file regardless of whether the violation was or was not discovered by the government. A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 may be imposed for a failure to file violation.

      (2)  A late filing violation occurs when an AES record is filed after the applicable period prescribed in § 30.4 of this part. A civil penalty not to exceed $1,100 for each day of delinquency, but not more than $10,000 per violation, may be imposed for failure to file timely export information or reports in connection with the exportation or transportation of cargo. (See 19 CFR part 192)

      (3)  A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation may be imposed for each violation of provisions of this part other than any violation encompassed by paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Such penalty may be in addition to any other penalty imposed by law.

      (4)  In addition to any other civil penalties specified in this section, any property involved in a violation may be subject to forfeiture under applicable law.

      § 30.72   Civil penalty procedures.

#### § § 30.72

      (a)  Whenever a civil penalty is sought for a violation of this part, the charged party is entitled to receive a formal complaint specifying the charges and, at his or her request, to contest the charges in a hearing before an administrative law judge. Any such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557.

      (b)  If, pursuant to 13 U.S.C. 306, the Secretary delegates functions addressed in this part to another agency, the provisions of law of that agency relating to penalty assessment, remission or mitigation of such penalties, collection of such penalties, and limitations of action and compromise of claims shall apply.

      (c)  If any person fails to pay a civil penalty imposed under this subpart, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to recover the amount imposed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order). No such action may be commenced more than five years after the date the order imposing the civil penalty becomes final. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

      (d)  Any penalties imposed under § 30.71(b)(1) and (b)(2) may be remitted or mitigated, if:

      (1) The penalties were incurred without willful negligence or fraud; or

      (2) Other circumstances exist that justify a remission or mitigation.

      (e)  Any amount paid in satisfaction of a civil penalty imposed under this subpart shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and credited as miscellaneous receipts, other than a payment to remit a forfeiture which shall be deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture fund.

      § 30.73   Enforcement.

#### § § 30.73

      (a)  The BIS's OEE may conduct investigations pursuant to this part. In conducting investigations, BIS may, to the extent necessary or appropriate to the enforcement of this part, exercise such authorities as are conferred upon BIS by other laws of the United States, subject, as appropriate, to policies and procedures approved by the Attorney General.

      (b)  ICE and CBP may enforce the provisions of this part and ICE, as assisted by CBP may conduct investigations under this part.

      § 30.74   Voluntary self-disclosure.

#### § § 30.74

      (a)  The Census Bureau strongly encourages disclosure of any violation or suspected violation of the FTR. Voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought. The Secretary of Commerce has delegated all enforcement authority under 13 U.S.C. Chapter 9, to the BIS and the DHS.

      (b)  (1) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to the Census Bureau for its review in determining whether to seek administrative action for violations of the FTR.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by the Census Bureau for review prior to the time that the Census Bureau, or any other agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or substantially similar information from another source and has commenced an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.

      (3) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what corrective actions will be required by the Census Bureau and/or whether the violation will be referred to the BIS to determine what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is within the discretion of the Census Bureau and the BIS, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal prosecution. In such a case, the BIS or the DHS would notify the DOJ of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the DOJ.

      (4) Any person, including USPPIs, authorized agents, or carriers, will not be deemed to have made a voluntary self-disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of senior management.

      (5) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.

      (c) —(1)  Any person disclosing information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, if a violation is suspected or a violation is discovered, conduct a thorough review of all export transactions for the past five years where violations of the FTR are suspected and notify the Census Bureau as soon as possible.

      (2)  (i) The initial notification must be in writing and be sent to the address in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The notification must include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. The notification should describe the general nature, circumstances, and extent of the violations. If the person making the disclosure subsequently completes the narrative account required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial notification for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (ii) Disclosure of suspected violations that involve export of items controlled, licensed, or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction by a department or agency of the federal government should be made to the appropriate federal department or agency.

      (3)  After the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of all export transactions where possible violations of the FTR are suspected. The Census Bureau recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If the review goes back less than five years, there is a risk that violations may not be discovered that later could become the subject of an investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive consideration under this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the FTR or other provision of law requires disclosure. Upon completion of the review, the Census Bureau should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The narrative account should include:

      (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, failure to file EEI, failure to correct fatal errors, failure to file timely corrections;

      (ii) Describe all data required to be reported under the FTR that was either not reported or reported incorrectly;

      (iii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;

      (iv) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations;

      (v) A description of any mitigating circumstances;

      (vi) Corrective measures taken; and

      (vii) ITNs of the missed and/or corrected shipments.

      (4)  Report all data required under the FTR that was not reported. Report corrections for all data reported incorrectly. All reporting of unreported data or corrections to previously reported data shall be made through the AES.

      (5)  The information constituting a Voluntary Self-Disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a Voluntary Self-Disclosure may be submitted to the U.S. Census Bureau, Branch Chief, Trade Regulations Branch by methods permitted by the Census Bureau. See  for more details.

      (d)  After the Census Bureau has been provided with the required narrative, it will promptly notify CBP, ICE, and the OEE of the voluntary disclosure, acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, the Census Bureau may take any of the following actions:

      (1) Inform the person or company making the voluntary self-disclosure of the action to be taken.

      (2) Issue a warning letter or letter setting forth corrective measures required.

      (3) Refer the matter, if necessary, to the OEE for the appropriate action.

    § 50.40   Fee structure for statistics for city blocks in the 1980 Census of Population and Housing.

#### § § 50.40

    (a) As part of the regular program of the 1980 census, the Census Bureau will publish printed reports containing certain summary population and housing statistics for each city block, drawn from the subjects which are being covered on a 100-percent basis. For these subjects, a substantial amount of additional data by block will be available on computer tape.

    (b) The 1980 block data under the regular program will be prepared for:

    (1) Each urbanized area in the United States. An urbanized area is delineated by the Census Bureau in each standard metropolitan statistical area and generally consists of a city or group of contiguous cities with a 1970 population of 50,000 or more, together with adjacent densely populated land (, land having a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile).

    (2) And, outside urbanized areas, for each incorporated place (such as a city or village) that was reported as having 10,000 or more inhabitants in:

    (i) The 1970 census, or

    (ii) The 1973, 1975, or 1976 official population estimates published by the Bureau, or

    (iii) A special census conducted by the Bureau on or before December 31, 1977.

    (c) Outside the above-mentioned urbanized areas and places, State and local government authorities will be able to contract with the Bureau of the Census to produce block data for their areas. In undertaking this contract, the requesting authority will be required to pay a fee, supply certain maps, and meet certain time deadlines as follows:

    (1)  (i) Population size:

    (ii) The final fee will be based upon the 1980 census population counts. A refund or additional charge will be made if the contracting area is in a different population size group as a result of the census.

    (iii) The cost for an area with a population of 10,000 or more will be determined on an individual basis.

    (iv) Multiple area contracts may be negotiated at a savings.

    (v) The fee is based on estimated 1980 costs. If the 1980 cost exceeds the estimated cost, an additional fee may be requested from the contracting area. If actual costs are less than the estimated cost, a refund may be made.

    (vi) Any incorporated place which contracts for block statistics and which reaches a population of 10,000 or more in the 1980 census will have the fee completely refunded, as the place will then be considered to be part of the regular block statistics program.

    (vii) If the area submits maps which are not adequate for the Bureau's purposes (see Maps, below) and therefore have to be redrafted by the Bureau, a surcharge of $300 per map sheet requiring revision will be applied to the fee for the particular area.

    (2)  (i) In order for the Bureau to provide data on a block-by-block basis, it must have a map which clearly delineates each block. The contracting government authority must supply such maps. A copy of the specifications for preparing the block maps will be provided upon request and, in any event, will accompany the copy of the contract which is sent to the government authority for signature.

    (ii) The maps must be furnished to the Census Bureau within 30 calendar days after the government authority signs the contract.

    (iii) The Bureau will review the maps and, if revision is necessary, return them within 30 calendar days to the government authority.

    (iv) Within 30 calendar days thereafter, the revised maps must be transmitted to the Bureau and, if they are still inadequate and must therefore be redrafted by the Bureau, the above-mentioned surcharge of $300 per map sheet requiring revision will be imposed.

    (3)  (i) The contract must be signed, and a downpayment of $250 per area made, by April 1, 1978. A check or money order should be made payable to “Commerce—Census.”

    (ii) If an area decides to withdraw after signing a contract and making a downpayment, the cost of work performed to date will be deducted from the refund.

    (iii) The balance of the fee must be mailed to the Bureau by January 1, 1980.

    (d) In consideration of the fees paid and maps supplied, the Bureau will:

    (1) Identify the individual blocks in its records and tabulations.

    (2) Make available the block data for the particular area in the same manner as for areas in the regular block statistics program (, both in terms of printed reports and computer summary tapes). Two copies of the printed report (including the printed maps) which contain the block statistics for the particular area will be furnished to the contracting government authority.

    (e) Requests for participation in the contract block statistics program or for further information should be addressed to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.

    § 50.50   Request for certification.

#### § § 50.50

    (a) Upon request, the Census Bureau certifies certain statistical materials (such as the population and housing unit counts of government entities, published tabulations, maps, and other documents). The Census Bureau charges customers a preset fee for this service according to the kind of certification requested (either an impressed document or an attestation) and the level of difficulty involved in compiling it (easy, moderate, or difficult, determined according to the resources expended) as well as the set cost of the data product (e.g., report or map) to be certified. Certification prices are shown in the following table:

    (b) There are two forms of certification available: Impressed Documents and Attestation.

    (1)  An impressed document is one that is certified by impressing the Census Bureau seal on the document itself. The Census Bureau act, Title 13, United States Code, Section 3, provides that the seal of the Census Bureau shall be affixed to all documents authenticated by the Census Bureau and that judicial notice shall be taken of the seal. This process attests that the document on which the seal is impressed is a true and accurate copy of a Census Bureau record.

    (2)  Attestation is a more formal process of certification. It consists of a signed statement by a Census Bureau official that the document is authentic and produced or published by the agency, followed by a signed statement of another Census Bureau official witnessing the authority of the first.

    (c) Requests for certification should be submitted on Form BC-1868(EF), Request for Official Certification, to the Census Bureau by fax, (301) 457-4714 or by e-mail,  Form BC-1868(EF) is available on the Census Bureau's Web site at:  A letter request—without Form BC-1868(EF)—will be accepted only if it contains the information necessary to complete a Form BC-1868(EF). No certification request will be processed without payment of the required fee.

> [67 FR 54951, Aug. 27, 2002]

    § 50.60   Request for certification.

#### § § 50.60

    (a)  Upon request, the Census Bureau certifies population and housing counts of standard governmental units to reflect boundary updates, including new incorporations, annexations, mergers, and so forth. The Census Bureau will produce a certificate, that is, a signed statement by a Census Bureau official attesting to the authenticity of the certified Census 2000 population and housing counts to reflect updates to the legal boundaries of governmental units after those in effect for Census 2000. This service will be a permanent process, but one that will be temporarily suspended during future decennial censuses. Typically, the Census Bureau will suspend this service, and direct its resources to the decennial census, for a total of five years—the two years preceding the decennial census, the decennial census year, and the two years following it. The Census Bureau will issue notices in the  announcing when it suspends and, in turn, resumes, the service.

    (1) The Census Bureau charges customers a preset fee for this service according to the amount of work involved in compiling the population and housing counts, as determined by the resources expended to meet customer requirements and the set cost of the product (one certificate). Certification fees may increase somewhat if the customer requests additional original certificates. Each additional certificate costs $35.00. Certification prices are shown in the following table:

    (2) [Reserved]

    (b)  The Census Bureau will process requests for population certificates for standard governmental units, in accordance with the Census Bureau's annual certification schedule or under an expedited certification arrangement. The boundaries for standard governmental units are regularly and customarily updated between decennial censuses by the Census Bureau's geographic support system. These governmental units include a variety of legally defined general- and special-purpose governmental units, including counties and statistically equivalent entities, minor civil divisions, incorporated places, consolidated cities, federally recognized American Indian reservations, and school districts. A complete list of entities is defined in paragraph (c) of this section.

    (1)  Annual population and housing certification is available around October 1 of each calendar year to new or existing governmental units that report legal boundary updates in the Census Bureau's annual Boundary and Annexation Survey. In accordance with reporting requirements of this survey, the legally effective dates of the boundary updates may not be later than January 1 of the calendar year. These certifications are available through September of the following year.

    (i) The annual certification service also is available to standard governmental units that are not in the Boundary and Annexation Survey of that year. Governmental units electing participation in this service must draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps. The legally effective dates of the boundaries may not be later than January 1 of the calendar year. The Census Bureau must receive the census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries and associated address ranges by April 1 of the same calendar year. The Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and usable, and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested by the governmental unit as submitted in accordance with state law or tribal authority.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (2)  (i) Expedited certification will be available where the customer requests any of the following:

    (A) Certification of boundary updates legally effective after January 1 of the current calendar year; or

    (B) Certification of boundary updates reported to the Census Bureau after April 1 of the current calendar year; or

    (C) Certification of boundary updates by the Census Bureau before October 1 of the current calendar year.

    (ii) Governmental units electing participation in this service must draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps. To allow sufficient processing time, the Census Bureau must receive acceptable census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries and associated address ranges no later than three months before the date requested by the customer to receive the population certificate. The Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and usable and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested as submitted in accordance with state law or tribal authority.

    (c)  The following is a list of the standard governmental units eligible for the Geographically Updated Population Certification Program:

    (1) Federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land entities [tribal government]; this includes a reservation designated as a colony, community, Indian community, Indian village, pueblo, rancheria, reservation, reserve, and village.

  PART 90—PROCEDURE FOR CHALLENGING POPULATION ESTIMATES

### Part 90

**Authority:** Authority: 13 U.S.C. 4 and 181.

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 17705, Mar. 24, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

    §  90.1   Scope and applicability.

#### § §  90.1

    Between decennial censuses, the Census Bureau annually prepares statistical estimates of the number of people residing in States and their governmental units. In general, these estimates are developed by updating the population counts produced in the most recent decennial census with demographic components of change data and/or other indicators of population change. These rules prescribe the administrative procedure available to governmental units to request a challenge to the most current of these estimates.

    § 90.2   Policy of the Census Bureau.

#### § § 90.2

    It is the policy of the Census Bureau to provide the most accurate population estimates possible given the constraints of resources and available statistical techniques. It is also the policy of the Census Bureau, to the extent feasible, to provide governmental units the opportunity to seek a review of and provide additional data for these estimates and to present evidence relating to the accuracy of the estimates.

    §  90.3   Definitions.

#### § §  90.3

    As used in this part (except where the context clearly indicates otherwise) the following definitions shall apply:

    (a)  means the U.S. _Census Bureau_, Department of Commerce.

    (b)  means, in accordance with this part, the process a governmental unit may use to provide additional input data for the Census Bureau's population estimate and the submission of substantive documentation in support thereof.

    (c)  means _Director_ of the Census Bureau, or an individual designated by the Director to perform under this part.

    (d)  means a statistically developed calculation of the number of people living in a governmental unit to update the preceding census or earlier estimate.

    (e) A  means the government of a county, municipality, township, incorporated place, or other minor civil division, which is a unit of general-purpose government below the State.

    (f) A  means a sub-State entity that does not function as an active general-purpose governmental unit. This situation exists in Connecticut, Rhode Island, for selected counties in Massachusetts, and for the Census Areas in Alaska.

    (g) For the purposes of this program, an  also includes the District of Columbia and non-functioning counties or statistical equivalents represented by a FSCPE member agency.

    §  90.4   General.

#### § §  90.4

    This part provides a procedure for a governmental unit to request a challenge of a population estimate of the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, will attempt to resolve the estimate with the governmental unit.

    §  90.5   Who may file a challenge.

#### § §  90.5

    A request for a challenge of a population estimate generated by the Census Bureau may be filed only by the chief executive officer or highest elected official of a governmental unit. In those instances where the FSCPE member agency represents a non-functioning county or statistical equivalent, the governor will serve as the chief executive officer or highest elected official.

    §  90.6   When a challenge may be filed.

#### § §  90.6

    (a) A request for a challenge to a population estimate may be filed any time up to 90 days after the release of the estimate by the Census Bureau. Publication by the Census Bureau on its website () shall constitute release. Documentation requesting a challenge of any estimate may also be filed any time up to 90 days after the date the Census Bureau, on its own initiative, revises that estimate.

    (b) If, however, a governmental unit has a sufficiently meritorious reason for not filing in a timely manner, the Census Bureau has the discretion to accept the late request.

    § 90.7   Where to file a challenge.

#### § § 90.7

    A request for a population estimate challenge must be prepared in writing by the governmental unit and filed with the Chief, Population Division, Census Bureau by sending the request via email to  or to a physical address that the Census Bureau will specify in the updated “Population Estimates Challenge Program Review Guide” to be posted in the  website. The governmental unit must designate a contact person who can be reached by telephone or email during normal business hours should questions arise with regard to the submitted materials.

    §  90.8   Evidence required.

#### § §  90.8

    (a) The governmental unit shall provide whatever evidence it has relevant to the request at the time of filing. The Census Bureau may request further evidence when necessary. The evidence submitted must be consistent with the criteria, standards, and regular processes the Census Bureau employs to generate the population estimate. Currently, the Census Bureau challenge process cannot accept estimates developed from methods different from those used by the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau will only accept a challenge when the evidence provided indicates the use of incorrect data, processes, or calculations in the estimates.

    (b) For counties and statistical equivalents, the Census Bureau uses a cohort-component of change method to produce population estimates. Each year, the components of change are updated. These components include births, deaths, migration, and change in the group quarters population. The Census Bureau will consider a challenge based on additional information on one or more of the components of change or about the group quarters population in a locality.

    (c) For minor civil divisions and incorporated places, the Census Bureau uses a housing unit method to distribute a county population to places within its legal boundaries. The components in this method include housing units estimates, average household population per housing unit, and an estimate of the population in group quarters. The estimation formula was simplified to increase the accuracy of the estimates following the application of differential privacy as per the Census Bureau's new disclosure avoidance framework. As a result, the persons per household (PPH) and occupancy rate components were replaced with the average household population per housing unit. Additionally, the Census Bureau will consider a challenge based on data related to changes in an area's housing stock, such as data on demolitions, condemned units, uninhabitable units, building permits, or mobile home placements or other housing inventory-based data deemed comparable by the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau will also consider a challenge based on additional information about the group quarters population in a locality.

    (d) The Census Bureau will also provide a guide on its website as a reference for governmental units to use in developing their data as evidence to support a challenge to the population estimate. In addition, a governmental unit may address any additional questions by contacting the Census Bureau at 301-763-2461 or by sending emails to  or by delivering mail to a physical address that the Census Bureau will specify in the updated version of the “Population Estimates Challenge Program Review Guide” to be posted in the  website.

    §  90.9   Review of challenge.

#### § §  90.9

    The Chief, Population Division, Census Bureau, or the Chief's designee shall review the evidence provided with the request for the population estimate challenge, shall work with the governmental unit to verify the data provided by the governmental unit, and evaluate the data to resolve the issues raised by the governmental unit. Furthermore, the designated FSCPE agencies are encouraged to serve as conduits with local governments in the review of pre-release estimates, to the extent that this is possible given data confidentiality requirements for pre-release data. Thereafter, the Census Bureau shall respond in writing with a decision to accept or deny the challenge. In the event that the Census Bureau finds that the population estimate should be updated, it will also post the revised estimate on the Census Bureau's website ().
