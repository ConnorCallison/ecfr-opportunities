#### § 601.301

        (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.301. The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration redelegated to the Procurement Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amend DOS acquisition policies, rules, and regulations.

        (b) The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is prescribed under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).

        (c) The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.

        601.302   Limitations.

#### § 601.302

        (a) The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal property and services, including construction, both within and outside the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to section 208 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4308), or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 ).

#### § 601.303

        (a) The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System. The DOSAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as is the FAR. However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself there will be no corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSAR implements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.

        (b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the  and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

        (c) The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described at FAR 1.105-2(c).

      Subpart 601.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities

        601.601   General.

#### § 601.601

        The Procurement Executive is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.601.

        601.601-70   Delegations of authority.

#### § 601.601-70

        (a)  As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) ( FAR 2.101):

        (1)  Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs;  that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds the contracting officer's warrant level.

        (i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts. Design/build solicitations and contracts may only be entered into with the written approval of A/OPE and OBO. Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval.

        (ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned.

        (2)  The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA.

        (3)  The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Chapter 7, Title I, of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4021 ), is delegated to the Director of the Foreign Service Institute, the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Supervisory Contracting Officer as the HCA.

        (4)  The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Title II of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4301 ), is delegated to the Director, Office of Foreign Missions, and the Administrative Officer as the HCA.

        (5)  The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C.287), is delegated to the Counselor for Administration as the HCA.

        (b)  Several DOS offices have been delegated limited procurement authority, although they have not been designated as HCAs. Matters requiring HCA resolution are referred to the A/LM/AQM. These delegations are provided only to warranted contracting officers in the respective offices. They are as follows:

        (1)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation for interpreting, translating, conference reporting, and related language support and escort services.

        (2)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 29 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.

        (3)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to the provisions of the Public Printing and Documents Act of 1968, as amended, and for the acquisition of newspapers, books, maps, and periodicals.

        (4)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 5, Title I, of the Department of State Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.

        (5)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR part 13, to enter into and administer contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $500,000 for non-commercial item acquisitions; up to $6.5 million for the acquisition of commercial items using the simplified acquisition procedures under the Test Program of FAR subpart 13.5; orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation and personal services contracts pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended; and, 48 CFR Chapter 7, Agency for International Development Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR), including any amendments thereto. INL follows the AIDAR guidance for doing personal service contracts. All other contracting actions follow the DOSAR and DoS regulations. These authorities extend to any acquisition performed by any Department of State contracting activity on behalf of INL.

        (6)  The authority to enter into and administer 8(a) purchase orders and contracts as a third party pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Small Business Administration.

        (7)  The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions for emergency or contingency operations necessary to protect life or federal property. This authority is limited to cases when a contracting officer in the Office of Acquisitions Management is unavailable.

        (8)  The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services on behalf of overseas posts is delegated to each Director, Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) at the following locations:

        (i) RPSO Frankfurt in conjunction with Consulate General Frankfurt; and

        (ii) RPSO Florida in conjunction with the Florida Regional Center.

        (c)  (1) Whenever the contracting officer makes use of the various statutory authorities available to the Department to waive the application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or laws governing acquisition, such as those provided in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2291) or the Foreign Service Buildings Act (22 U.S.C. 294), a written determination of the basis for using the authority must be prepared and included in the file.

        (2) If the statute or current practice of the requiring office does not specify a particular format, use the following format.

        (3) The determination may be made for an individual acquisition or on a class basis, as appropriate. The Contracting Officer must ensure that the proper official makes the determination in question. There may already be a Department of State delegation of authority to a specific individual to make the determination.

#### § 601.602

        601.602-1   Authority.

#### § 601.602-1

        (a) DOS contracts are awarded pursuant to the foreign affairs management responsibilities conferred on the Secretary of State (22 U.S.C. 2656), and the various laws, regulations, and Executive Orders relating thereto.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOS regulations, and this DOSAR, the Procurement Executive has the authority to execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, other contractual arrangements, and other agreements, including FAR-covered interagency acquisition agreements, for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of personal property, services, and for the sale of personal property. The Procurement Executive may further delegate this authority to those DOS employees appointed or designated to the contracting activities enumerated in 601.601-70.

        (c) The contracting officer shall not award, modify, or terminate a contract unless all reviews, clearances, and approvals prescribed in the FAR or the DOSAR have been obtained, and all applicable requirements of law, the FAR, the DOSAR, and other regulations have been met.

> [53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 55 FR 5774, Feb. 16, 1990; 59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994; 72 FR 45695, Aug. 15, 2007; 81 FR 24707, Apr. 27, 2016]

        601.602-3   Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

#### § 601.602-3

        (b)  (1) The Government generally is not bound by unauthorized commitments. Unauthorized commitments violate the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the DOSAR, and proper acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorized commitments are serious violations that could result in disciplinary action against the transgressor, e.g., withdrawal of a contracting officer's warrant or a Contracting Officer's Representative delegation or collection action.

        (2)(i) Unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000. The head of the contracting activity is delegated the authority to serve as the ratifying official for unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000, including unauthorized commitments from other agencies where a DOS employee serves as the contracting officer for that action. The head of the contracting activity may refer any actions not exceeding $1,000 to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification if he or she so chooses.

        (ii) Unauthorized commitments exceeding $1,000. All DOS unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 shall be submitted to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification. Unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 from other agencies may be referred to the other agency's representative at post for resolution in accordance with that agency's ratification process.

        (3)  Unauthorized contractual commitments that would involve claims subject to resolution under the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 shall be processed in accordance with FAR subpart 33.2 and subpart 633.2.

        (4)  The Procurement Executive may refer egregious cases of unauthorized commitments to HR/ER for possible disciplinary action in accordance with 3 FAM 4370 or 3 FAM 4540. Examples might include repeated unauthorized commitments knowingly made by an employee; failure to take responsibility for a deliberate unauthorized commitment; or similar reasons. The Procurement Executive may revoke the appointment certificate of any contracting officer who makes an unauthorized commitment. The Procurement Executive may direct a contracting officer to revoke the appointment memorandum of a Contracting Officer's Representative or Government Technical Monitor who makes an unauthorized commitment.

        601.602-3-70   Procedures.

#### § 601.602-3-70

        (a)(1) The person who made the unauthorized commitment shall submit all records and documents concerning the unauthorized commitment to the contracting officer assigned the ratification action. That person shall provide a complete written, signed statement of the facts, including why normal acquisition procedures were not followed; a statement justifying a sole source acquisition (Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition) if the unauthorized commitment exceeds $100,000; why and how the vendor was selected; a list of other sources considered; a description of work or products; a statement regarding the status of performance; an estimated or agreed price; certified funding citations; a statement as to why he/she should not be personally liable for the cost, e.g., a public purpose was served and no personal benefit was received; a statement as to whether the individual has ever been responsible for any other unauthorized commitments in the Department of State; and, a statement as to the number of unauthorized commitments processed by the responsible office within the last three calendar years and the circumstances surrounding each of these actions.

        (2) When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.

        (3) In addition, a cognizant management official from the office that employed the individual who made the unauthorized commitment at the time the unauthorized commitment was made shall provide a statement detailing actions that he/she will take to ensure that such commitments will not occur again under the same or similar circumstances.

        (4) This statement shall be cleared by the Executive Director of the Bureau that employs (or employed) the person who made the unauthorized commitment.

        (b) The contracting officer assigned the ratification action shall prepare and execute a recommendation to the ratifying official. The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.

        (1) The recommendation shall include the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized commitment; the information prescribed in FAR 1.602-3(c)(1) and (c)(3) through (6); and a recommendation to the ratifying official as to whether the unauthorized commitment should be ratified.

        (2) Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.

        (c) The information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be supported by factual findings included or referenced in the recommendation.

        (d) The contracting officer shall submit the complete file to the ratifying official. For actions exceeding $1,000, the file shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity to the Procurement Executive.

        (e) Upon receipt and review of the complete file, if the ratifying official ratifies the unauthorized commitment, the file shall be returned, through the head of the contracting activity if the action exceeds $1,000, to the contracting officer for issuance of the appropriate contractual document(s). If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.

#### § 601.603-3

        (a)  There is no contracting officer authority conferred upon any DOS employee by virtue of position. The Procurement Executive appoints all DOS contracting officers, in conformance with FAR 1.603-3, with the one exception as noted in paragraph (b) of this section. The contracting officer shall retain the original copy of the Standard Form 1402, Certificate of Appointment, signed by the Procurement Executive. Only qualified employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. A/OPE is responsible for providing guidance and oversight in managing such appointments.

        (b)  The Chief of Mission is delegated the authority by the Procurement Executive to issue temporary contracting officer warrants for periods up to 90 calendar days in order to cover emergency, post-specific operational requirements (e.g., staffing gaps, medical evacuations, extended leave, etc.). These temporary appointments shall be executed on the Standard Form 1402, and a copy shall be furnished to A/OPE. The warrant shall contain both a dollar limitation of no more than $100,000 and a specific time period (not to exceed 90 days) during which the warrant is effective.

        (c)  Only United States Government employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. For acquisitions at $25,000 and below only, this includes locally employed staff ( Foreign Service Nationals and Third Country nationals). Personal services contractors are not eligible for appointment as DOS contracting officers.

        (d)  Individuals who may sign personal services agreements (PSAs) are limited to the following:

        (1) The Human Resources Officer;

        (1)  The General Services Administration has delegated domestic leasing authority to the Department of State's Office of Real Property Management (A/OPR/RPM). This delegation is accomplished on a case-by-case basis.

        (2)  Authority to sign real property leases abroad is held by the Director/Chief Operating Officer (DIR/COO) of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), through the Secretary of State, under the Foreign Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 ).

        604.804   Closeout of contract files.

#### § 604.804

        604.804-70   Contract closeout procedures.

#### § 604.804-70

        (a) This section sets forth procedures for closing out contracts awarded using other than simplified acquisition procedures by contracting activities and requirements offices. It is the Department's policy to close out contracts in the time frames prescribed by FAR Part 4.

        (b) Contracting activities are responsible for initiating each contract closeout. Contracting activities and requirements offices are jointly responsible for timely compliance with required contract closeout procedures.

        (c) The contract closeout process shall begin as soon as possible after the contract is physically completed, which means that the contractor has delivered the required supplies and the Government has inspected and accepted them, or the contractor has performed and the Government has accepted all services required by the contract, and the base period and any option periods exercised have expired.

        (d)  The normal steps for closing out a physically completed contract shall be as follows. These steps are summarized in the Contract Closeout Checklist, which shall be completed by the contracting officer and included in the contract file. The contracting officer shall indicate any items that are not applicable (e.g., patent reports, royalty reports, etc.).

        (1) The contracting officer shall verify that all work under the contract has been completed; obtain the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and conduct an initial funds status review,  determine if the contract has excess funds that should be deobligated by contract modification. Contracting officers shall send a cover memo to the COR, to which should be attached the COR Completion Certificate, the applicable performance evaluation form (depending on whether the contract is for construction (SF-1420), architect-engineering services (SF-1421), or other supplies or services (DS-1771, )); and, a final payment and closeout memorandum. Contracting officers may require CORs to input past performance data directly into the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) as opposed to completing a paper evaluation form (see 642.1503-70).

        (2) After receipt of the COR's response, and the contractor's release, the contracting officer shall send a final payment memo to the office responsible for payment of invoices/vouchers.

        (3) An audit is required for cost-reimbursement contracts over $550,000, unless available data are considered adequate for a reasonableness determination, in which case the contract file shall be documented with the appropriate rationale. Requests for audits, normally by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in accordance with the agreement DOS has with DCAA to conduct incurred cost audits, shall be submitted through the A/LM/AQM/BOD/QA Audit Team (see 642.101(b)). Cost-reimbursement contracts may be closed after receipt of the audit report and resolution of any issues raised. Quick closeout procedures may be followed, as prescribed in FAR 42.708. The contracting officer may request an audit of any contract, if warranted; however, audits should not be requested if the cost of the audit is likely to exceed potential cost recovery, except where fraud or misrepresentation is suspected.

        (4) The contracting officer shall send a letter to the contractor requesting release of claims, using the appropriate format. In addition, a Contractor Assignment Letter is required for certain contracts. To determine which format is applicable, contracting officers shall refer to the Payments clause in the contract.

        (5) The contracting officer shall reconcile the contract obligations and contractor payments, and then deobligate any excess funds remaining in the contract by issuing a contract modification on a SF-30. Close coordination with the finance office is necessary in order to receive the required information to perform a funds status review.

        (6) The contracting officer shall verify that all relevant documentation is included in the contract file (see 604.803-70).

        (7) Upon completion of 8(a) contracts, the contracting officer shall complete the Small Business Administration's Contract Completion Form within ten (10) days of contract completion. One copy shall be forwarded to SBA, one copy shall be retained in the contract file, and one copy shall be sent to OSDBU.

        (8) For classified contracts, the contractor is required to return to the Department all classified material received or generated under the contract, or to destroy all classified material, unless retention is requested and authorized by the Department. The contracting officer shall notify DS/PRD/IN of contract completion, final delivery of goods or services or the termination of the classified contract. The contracting officer shall ensure that any classified material contained in the contract file is properly marked and accounted for.

        (9) Closeout documents are available on the Intranet at the A/OPE Web site.

        (e) Contract files that have been closed out shall be retained in accordance with the schedule in FAR 4.805.

        (f) Contract files for contracts using simplified acquisition procedures are considered closed when the contracting officer receives evidence of property/services and final payment. Disposal of such files shall be as prescribed in FAR 4.805.

        604.1601   Policy.

#### § 604.1601

        (c)(1)  Uniform numbers shall be assigned to all DOS procurement instruments, domestic and overseas. The numbering system applies to all contracts, purchase orders, and other related instruments, including solicitation documents and delivery orders. This includes instruments executed by DOS contracting officers on behalf of other federal agencies. It does not include requisitions submitted to a contracting activity, or to instruments awarded under Federal assistance arrangements, e.g., grants, cooperative agreements, and loans. Numbers shall be placed in appropriate spaces on government forms and appear on all documentation intended to support official contract files.

        (2)  Heads of contracting activities are responsible for enforcing compliance with the uniform numbering system. Heads of contracting activities shall develop and maintain a system for assigning and recording contract numbers that conforms to this section.

        (3)  A 13-character “alpha-numeric” designator shall be assigned to all DOS procurement instruments. Positions (beginning at the left) one through six shall identify the purchasing office; positions seven and eight, the fiscal year in which the number is assigned; position nine, a symbol designating a type of procurement instrument; and positions ten through thirteen, a four-position serial number.

        (i) The first six positions shall commence with “S” to designate a DOS-issued contract. The remaining five characters shall identify the activity preparing the instrument. Domestic and overseas contracting activities shall assign the character codes using the five-digit designator from the listing at  DOS organizations not listed shall contact A/OPE for assignment of an office code.

        (ii) The seventh and eighth positions shall be the last two digits of the fiscal year in which the number is assigned.

        (iii) The ninth position shall be a capital letter assigned to indicate the type of instrument, as follows:

        (iv)(A) The tenth through thirteenth positions shall be the serial number for the instrument. A separate set of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Each series of numbers for the same activity shall begin with the number 0001 at the start of each fiscal year.

        (v)(A) The following illustrates a properly configured contract number for the first number assigned to a fiscal year 2015 contract awarded by the Department of State, Embassy Ottawa: SCA525-15-C-0001

        (B) Use of the dashes to separate the individual elements of the series is optional; however, when reporting individual contract actions to the Federal Procurement Data System (see FAR subpart 6.4), dashes shall not be used.

        (C) Contracting activities are authorized to use the first digit of the serial number (position 10) to establish discrete series of numbers. For example, the “1000” series may be reserved for Bureau of Consular Affairs requirements (domestic), or the “1000” series may be reserved for Economic section requirements (overseas). Use of discrete series is appropriate generally for activities handling large numbers of transactions and can provide useful management information.

        (4)  Solicitation amendments are to be numbered sequentially, beginning with the alpha designator “A,” e.g., A001. Contract modifications shall also be numbered sequentially, beginning with the alpha designator “M,” e.g., M001.

        (b) Reviews should be limited in time to prevent unnecessary procurement lead-time, but thorough in scope, considering all documents in the contract file and all relevant contracting issues. Checklists may be used to facilitate a thorough review, as appropriate.

        604.7102-3   Approval.

#### § 604.7102-3

        The solicitation, contract, or contract modification being reviewed shall not be issued until all review comments requiring corrective action are satisfactorily resolved.

        (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing competition.

Such procurements shall be supported by an approved Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements of FAR 6.303-2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, and administrative and management support. Areas of consideration for potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as attachments to the justification. Justifications shall specify an effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life of the technical equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine whether the standardization should be continued, revised or canceled.

        (iii) Copies of supporting documentary evidence and a list of all necessary or probable witnesses, including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and the subject matter of their testimony;

        (iv) A list of all contractors involved, either as principals or as affiliates, including current or last known home and business addresses and ZIP codes;

        (v) A statement of the acquisition history with such contractors;

        (vi) A statement concerning any known pertinent active or potential criminal investigation, criminal or civil court proceedings, or administrative claim before Boards of Contract Appeals; and

        (vii) A statement from each DOS organizational element affected by the debarment action as to the impact of a debarment on DOS programs.

        (3) As deemed appropriate, the debarring official may conduct investigations to supplement the information provided in the referral, or may request investigations by the Office of the Inspector General or other Department office.

        (b)  (1) If the contractor does not respond to a debarment notice within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the debarring official may put the debarment into effect.

        (2) In response to the debarment notice, if the contractor or its representative notifies the debarring official within 30 days after receipt of the notice that it wants to present information and arguments in person to the debarring official, that official, or a designee, shall chair such a meeting. The oral presentation shall be conducted informally and a transcript need not be made. However, the contractor may supplement its oral presentation with written information and arguments for inclusion in the administrative record.

        (3) Pursuant to FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the contractor may request a fact-finding proceeding.

        (4) The debarring official shall designate a fact-finding official and shall provide the fact-finding official with a copy of all documentary evidence considered in proposing debarment.

        (5) In addition to the purposes provided in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the hearing is intended to provide the debarring official with findings of fact based on a preponderance of evidence submitted to the fact-finding official and to provide the debarring official with a determination as to whether a cause for debarment exists, based on the facts as found.

        (6) The fact-finding proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with procedures determined by the fact-finding official. The rules shall be as informal as is practicable, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b). The fact-finding official is responsible for making the transcribed record of the hearing, unless the contractor and the fact-finding official agree to waive the requirement for a transcript.

        (7) The fact-finding official shall deliver written findings and the transcribed record, if made, to the debarring official. The findings shall resolve any facts in dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and recommend whether a cause for debarment exists.

        (c)  (1) Upon receipt of a complete referral and after consulting with the Office of the Legal Adviser, the debarring official shall decide whether to initiate debarment action.

        (2) When a determination is made to initiate action, the debarring official shall provide to the contractor and any specifically named affiliates written notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c).

        (3) When a determination is made not to initiate action, the debarring official shall so advise the DOS officer who made the referral.

        (d)  In addition to complying with FAR 9.406-3(d) and (e), the debarring official shall provide single copies of the decision to each DOS organizational element affected by the decision.

**Source:** Source: 69 FR 19332, Apr. 13, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

        611.600   Scope of subpart.

#### § 611.600

        On September 18, 2001, the Department of Commerce (DOC) authorized the Department of State to use the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS). This authority expires on October 1, 2006. The Department of Defense has approved the Department's Embassy Security Protection Program (DOSESPP) as a national defense program eligible for the priorities support under the DPAS.

        611.602   General.

#### § 611.602

        (c)(1) Authority to use the DPAS is limited to the following circumstances:

        (i) The contract or order must be placed with a U.S. firm; and,

        (ii) The contract or order must be in support of the DOSESPP, which consists of work involving the security of overseas posts. The DOSESPP includes a wide range of elements of both physical and technical security, such as:

        (A) New Embassy/Consulate Compound (NEC/NCC) Program. This program involves the construction of new secure Embassies, Consulates, and related facilities, as well as renovations of newly acquired buildings when used as alternatives to the construction of new secure buildings.

        (B) Physical security upgrade. This includes installation of forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) windows and doors, walls/fences, active anti-ram barriers, bollards (concrete and steel barriers), and related items.

        (C) Forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) components. This includes doors, windows, and related facilities and items that can provide the necessary time to protect Government personnel from attack.

        (D) Armored vehicles. This includes passenger vehicles with appropriate armoring.

        (E) Entry control and building surveillance equipment. This includes walk-through metal detectors, X-ray equipment, surveillance cameras, explosive detection equipment, and other features to enhance the protection of Government personnel and facilities.

        (2) DOC has assigned the following priority rating to DOSESPP contracts or orders: DO-H8.

        611.603   Procedures.

#### § 611.603

        (f) Department of State contracting officers are authorized to sign DO-H8 rated contracts or orders. It is the responsibility of the requirements office to determine which contracts or orders should be rated. All contracts with U.S. firms under the DOSESPP will not necessarily need to be assigned a priority rating.

        (g) The contracting officer should place a DO-H8 rating on any contract or order if there is any doubt as to whether a contractor doing work for Embassy security protection will be able to deliver on time. If an unrated contract or order is not completed on time, the contracting officer may modify the contract or order to add the rating; however, the rating shall only be effective for the newly established delivery date, not the original delivery date.

        (1) DOC can provide special assistance to implement the DPAS program in specific cases. For example, the Department may request a higher priority rating, or request that DOC issue a written directive to a contractor that is not complying with the DPAS regulations. In addition, although the DPAS program normally applies only to U.S. firms, if the Department has a prime contract with a foreign firm that will be awarding subcontracts with U.S. firms, the Department may request from DOC authorization to place a rating on the prime contract.

        (2) Contracting officers or requirements offices who wish to request special assistance from DOC must complete DOC Form BXA-999,  and submit it to A/OPE, which will arrange for submission of the request to DOC.

      611.002   Policy.

#### § 611.002

      611.002-70   Metric system implementation.

#### § 611.002-70

      (a)  The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 205a, ), requires Federal agencies to establish implementing guidelines pursuant to metric policy to adopt the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measurements for United States trade and commerce. This section establishes the Department of State's metric conversion guidelines.

      (b)  This section applies to all DOS acquisitions, except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.

      (c)

      means the use of both traditional and metric systems. For example, an item is designated, produced and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison.

      means the use of only standard metric (SI) measurements in specifications, standards, supplies and services.

      means the use of both traditional and hard metric values in specifications, standards, supplies and services.

      means any item having an application or meaning depending substantially on some measured quantity. For example, measurement sensitive items include product or performance criteria and standards binding on others, such as emission levels, size and weight limitations, etc.

      means the International System of Units (Le System International d'Unites (SI)) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

      means any act that increases metric system use, including metric training and initiation or conversion of measurement sensitive processes and systems to the metric system.

      means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents. The physical dimensions, however, are not changed.

      means the predominant weight and measurement system currently used in the United States, also referred to as the “inch-pound system.” The traditional system includes such commonly used units as inch, foot, yard, mile, pint, quart, gallon, bushel, ounce (fluid and avoirdupois), pound, degree Fahrenheit, ampere, candela, and second.

      (d)  (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the metric system in a manner consistent with 15 U.S.C. 205a,

      (2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in acquisition consistent with security, operations, economic, technical, logistical, training and safety requirements.

      (3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric system by acquiring commercially available metric products and services that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, solicitations for DOS acquisitions shall:

      (i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric are soft, dual and hybrid metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the selection of proper metric units and symbols is available from the National Technical Information Service; and

      (ii) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000 contracting officers shall return to the requirements office all specifications and statements of work that are not expressed in some form of metric terms unless the requirements office has prepared a justification, for the approval of the contracting officer, for the use of non-metric specifications or statements of work. The justification shall be in a format as prescribed by the head of the contracting activity. Option year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.

      (4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply Schedules.

      (5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications or statements of work include, but are not limited to:

      (i) Existing specifications or standards are in inch-pound units, unless conversion of the existing specifications or standards is necessary or advantageous to the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of existing systems with new metric components should be avoided if the total cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $50,000;

      (ii) Metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a business-related activity; however, soft, hybrid, or dual systems may be used during the transition to hard metric;

      (iii) The use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.

      (6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve the waiver prior to the release of the solicitation. The waiver shall be placed in the contract file. If the waiver is not approved, the contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an explanation for the disapproval.

      (7) The in-house operating metric costs shall be identified. Identification includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop metric specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices shall maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by metric conversion.

      (8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and purchased in metric or dual units.

      (9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be purchased in metric or dual units.

      (10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.

        (b)(2) It is the Department's policy to use the structured approach for profit/fee analysis contained in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) FAR Supplement (see 48 CFR chapter 3), for acquisitions awarded by domestic contracting activities and RPSOs. This document may be accessed from A/OPE's Acquisition Web site (see 601.105-3). Contracting officers shall follow these procedures. HHS Form 674,  or an equivalent form, may be used to document the profit/fee analysis. If more than one pre-negotiation cost objective is developed (e.g., high and low), a separate form should be completed for each. The contracting officer shall ensure that a written explanation is attached to the form justifying the weights chosen for each cost category or factor. This approach considers the factors outlined in FAR 15.404-4(d).

        (c)(4)(i)(B) In accordance with a delegation from OBO, overseas posts may request a waiver from A/OPE if post is unable to negotiate a price for architect-engineer services within the six percent price limitation. To obtain a waiver, the contracting officer must send the following information to A/OPE:

        () Description of project;

        () Estimated dollar amount, with cost breakdown; and,

        () Description of negotiation efforts.

      Subpart 615.6—Unsolicited Proposals

        615.604   Agency points of contact.

#### § 615.604

        (a)(4) The contact points for unsolicited proposals are the heads of the contracting activities.

#### § 619.202

        619.202-70   The Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program.

#### § 619.202-70

        (a)  The Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist small businesses with business development, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The program is also designed to improve the performance of DOS contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between small businesses and prime contractors, and increase the overall number of small businesses that receive DOS contract and subcontract awards. The program is limited to non-commercial item acquisitions.

        (b)  The definitions of small business (SB), HUBZone small business concern (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) are the same as found in FAR 2.101.

        means a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the protégé.

        means a small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business that is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a mentor-protégé program.

        (c)  For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm is not considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely because the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under the program.

        (d)  (1) Eligible business prime contractors not included on the “List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs” that are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible protégé.

        (2) A firm's status as a protégé under a DOS contract shall not have an effect on the firm's ability to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.

        (e)  (1) Under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E)), DOS is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated acquisitions.

        (2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance, if any, under an existing arrangement, may be considered by the contracting officer in:

        (i) Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under FAR 19.704-5; and,

        (ii) Assessing the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).

        (3) A non-monetary award may be presented annually (or as often as appropriate) to the mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Operations Director, OSDBU.

        (f)  The success of the DOS Mentor-Protégé Program will be measured by:

        (1) The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts awarded to protégé firms under DOS contracts from the date the protégé enters the program;

        (2) The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to the protégé under other Federal agencies and commercial contracts; and,

        (3) The developmental assistance provided by the mentor firm and the resulting increase in the technical, managerial, financial or other capabilities of the protégé firm, as reported by the protégé.

        (g)  A mentor firm:

        (1) May be either a large or small business;

        (2) Must be eligible for award of U.S. Government contracts;

        (3) Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of protégé to perform as subcontractors; and,

        (4) Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with protégé and firms with whom they have established business relationships.

        (h)  (1) A protégé firm must be:

        (i) A SB, HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, or SDVOSB as those terms are defined in FAR 2.101;

        (ii) Small in the NAICS code for the services or supplies to be provided by the protégé to the mentor; and,

        (iii) Eligible for award of U.S. Government contracts.

        (2) Except for SDB and HUBZone firms, a protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this subsection. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégé that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. SDB status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined by FAR 19.304. HUBZone status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined by FAR 19.1303.

        (3) Protégé may have multiple mentors. protégé participating in mentor-protégé programs in addition to DOS's program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each agency's program.

        (i)  (1) Mentor firms are solely responsible for selecting protégé firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and select a broad base of protégé firms whose core competencies support DOS's mission.

        (2) Mentors may have multiple protégé.

        (3) The selection of protégé firms by mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a mentor shall be handled in accordance with FAR and SBA regulations.

        (j)  (1) Firms interested in becoming a mentor firm shall apply in writing to OSDBU. The application (Form DS-4053, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program Application), shall be evaluated by the nature and extent of technical and managerial support proposed as well as the extent of financial assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture support, and traditional subcontracting support proposed.

        (2) A proposed mentor shall submit the application form and associated information to OSDBU.

        (k)  (1) OSDBU shall review the information to ensure the mentor and protégé are eligible and the information provided is complete. OSDBU shall consult with the contracting officer on the adequacy of the proposed mentor-protégé arrangement, and its review shall be complete no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the application by OSDBU.

        (2) Upon completion of the review, OSDBU will advise the mentor if its application is acceptable. The mentor may then implement the developmental assistance program in accordance with the approved agreement.

        (3) The agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and protégé firms only. The agreement itself does not create any privity of contract between the mentor or protégé and the DOS.

        (l)  The forms of developmental assistance a mentor can provide to a protégé include:

        (1) Management guidance relating to:

        (i) Financial management;

        (ii) Organizational management;

        (iii) Overall business management/planning;

        (6) Any other types of permissible, mutually beneficial assistance.

        (m)  (1) A mentor or protégé firm may voluntarily withdraw from the program. However, in no event shall such withdrawal impact the program mission and contractual requirements under the prime contract.

        (2) Mentor and protégé firms shall submit to OSDBU annual reports on program progress of the mentor-protégé agreements. Large business mentors may submit these reports as part of their SB, HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, and SDVOSB plan submission in accordance with the due date on the SF-295. DOS shall consider the following in evaluating these reports:

        (i) Specific actions taken by the contractor, during the evaluation period, to increase the participation of protégés as suppliers to the U.S. Government and to commercial entities;

        (ii) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of a protégé as defined in the agreement;

        (iii) To what extent the protégé has met the developmental objectives in the agreement; and,

        (iv) To what extent the mentor firm's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program resulted in the protégé receiving contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the DOS.

        (3) The DOS OSDBU shall submit the annual reports to the cognizant contracting officer regarding participating prime contractor(s) performance in the program.

        (4) Mentor and protégé firms shall submit an evaluation to the OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the program, whichever comes first.

        (n)  (1) OSDBU shall oversee the program and shall work with the cognizant contracting officer to achieve program objectives.

        (2) DOS may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé agreement if it determines that such an action is in the Department's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the mentor and protégé firms after approval by the OSDBU Operations Director. Rescission of an agreement does not change the terms of the subcontract between the mentor and the protégé or the prime contractor's obligations under its subcontracting plan.

        (o)  (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 652.219-72, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program, in all unrestricted solicitations exceeding $650,000 ($1,500,000 for construction) that offer subcontracting opportunities.

        (2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at DOSAR 652.219-73, Mentor Requirements and Evaluation, in all contracts where the prime contractor has signed a Mentor-Protégé Agreement with the Department of State.

        It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent Department solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. Incorporation of the goals does not require that large prime contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they plan to subcontract, specific goals be established for doing business with small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms. Where funds are available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, is encouraged.

#### § 628.305

        (b)(1) Acquisitions for services, including construction but excluding personal services contracts, requiring contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United States, shall include the contractual obligation for coverage under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651-1654, as amended), for covered contractor employees. For the purposes of this section, “covered contractor employees” includes the following individuals:

        (i) United States citizens or residents;

        (ii) Individuals hired in the United States or its possessions, regardless of citizenship; and,

        (iii) Local nationals and third country nationals where contract performance takes place in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws.

        (2) Individuals who are self-employed (, they have not incorporated) do not meet the definition of an employee. No Defense Base Act insurance is required when contracting with these individuals.

        (3) Exceptions are discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f) of this section.

        (d) The authority to recommend a waiver from the Defense Base Act, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d), is reserved to the Secretary of State.

        (e)(1) The Secretary of Labor has waived the applicability of the Defense Base Act to all DOS service contracts, including construction, for contractor employees who are local nationals or third country nationals. This waiver is conditioned on the requirement for the contractor to provide workers' compensation benefits against the risk of work injury or death and assume liability toward the employees and their beneficiaries for war-hazard injury, death, capture, or detention as prescribed by the local workers' compensation laws.

        (2) In cases where a contract is performed in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws, local and third country national contractor employees are considered to be “covered contractor employees”, and the contractor shall acquire Defense Base Act insurance for those employees pursuant to the contract between the Department of State and the Defense Base Act insurance broker.

        (f)(1) Section 16 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2680a), as amended, provides that the Defense Base Act shall not apply with respect to such contracts as the Secretary of State determines are contracts with persons employed to perform work for the Department of State on an intermittent basis for not more than 90 days in a calendar year. The Department of State has established that “persons” includes employees hired by companies under contract with the Department. The Procurement Executive has the authority to issue the waivers for employees who work on an intermittent or short-term basis. Waivers may be issued only for employees who are U.S. citizens and residents, and only where the contractor provides evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for those employees. Waivers may not be issued for local or third country nationals.

        (2) The contractor shall submit waiver requests to the contracting officer. The request shall contain the following information:

        (i) Contract number;

        (ii) Name of contractor;

        (iii) Brief description of the services to be provided under the contract and country of performance;

        (iv) Name and position title of individual(s);

        (v) Nationality of individual(s) (must be U.S. citizen or resident);

        (vi) Dates (or timeframe) of performance at the overseas location; and

        (vii) Evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for these employees (e.g., evidence that the State workers' compensation program covers workers on short-term foreign assignments).

        (3) The contracting officer shall review the request for completeness and accuracy. If the request is complete and accurate, the contracting officer shall forward the request to the Procurement Executive. If the contractor does not provide complete and accurate information, the contracting officer shall return the request to the contractor with an explanation as to what additional information is required.

        (4) The Procurement Executive shall review requests for waiver forwarded by the contracting officer and either approve or disapprove the request. The Procurement Executive shall return the request indicating his/her approval or disapproval to the contracting officer. Any request that is not approved shall describe the reason(s) why the request was not approved. The contracting officer shall provide the contractor with the original of the approved or disapproved document and maintain a copy in the contract file.

If the contracting officer is unsure as to whether offers will include covered contractor employees, the contracting officer shall insert the clause.

        633.214   Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

#### § 633.214

        633.214-70   DOS ADR program.

#### § 633.214-70

        (a)  The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the Disputes statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 71). Contracting officers shall consider all possible means of reaching a negotiated settlement, consistent with the Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 33.211.

        (b) —(1)  Contracting officers should consider using ADR in those cases where:

        (i) Only facts are in dispute;

        (ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;

        (iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the anticipated costs of litigation;

        (iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;

        (v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar situations;

        (vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,

        (vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.

        (2)  The following circumstances do not favor use of ADR:

        (i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, making compromise difficult;

        (ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending cases or on the future conduct of Department business;

        (iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;

        (iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;

        (v) A significant policy question is involved;

        (vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;

        (vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not parties to the contract;

        (viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) exceed the cost of litigation;

        (ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for delay or discovery; or,

        (x) The case involves criminal violations.

        (3)  Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the claim and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution shall be unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the disagreement among themselves. If this fails, before issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of the contracting activity, and contact the Office of the Legal Adviser and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible to resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional fact-finding or designating a neutral expert in the disputed issue to provide an advisory opinion.

        (c)  If the initial action to resolve the dispute fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is appealed, ADR may still be feasible. The CBCA issues a notice regarding ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract Disputes Act. This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting officers are urged to discuss with contractors at any time:

        (1)  A settlement judge is either an administrative judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute for the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based on the specifics of the individual dispute. By holding a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the settlement judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually, and the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the settlement judge's opinions, based on his or her experience in handling prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments have merit or not.

        (2)  A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party presents an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral advisor (who may be appointed by the CBCA) and to principals of the parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. The parties mutually decide on the form of presentation without regard to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance agreement by the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor. Upon conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. The neutral advisor may assist the parties in negotiating settlement, including making non-binding recommendations.

        (3)  A summary trial with binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling of an appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the trial and the time for presentation and decision are tailored to the needs of the particular case. Trial procedures and rules applicable to appeals are modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. The parties must agree, however, that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the judge(s) are final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. A summary “bench” decision is issued at the conclusion of the trial or a summary written decision will be issued within ten (10) days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt of a trial transcript.

        (4)  Mediation is a process in which a neutral and impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in conflict to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing parties to assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no decisionmaking authority and cannot impose a decision. Mediation assistance involves working with the parties to improve their communications, clarify or interpret data, identify key issues to be discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement options, or help to identify or formulate areas of agreement. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet:

        (5)  Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to an impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations toward a settlement. Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-552) allows agencies to use binding arbitration, the law provides that the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after it is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is preferable. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet:

        (6)  Partnering involves an agreement in principle to share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish and promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a contractual agreement and it does not create any legally enforceable rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative attitude in completing Government contracts. The three basic steps in partnering are:

        (i) Establish the new relationship through personal contact among the principals for the Government and the contractor before the work begins;

        (ii) Prepare a joint statement of goals establishing common objectives in specific detail for reaching the goals; and,

        (iii) Identify specific dispute prevention processes designed to head off problems, evaluate performance, and promote cooperation. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet:

        (d)  The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on the procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time allowed for each party to present its case. The parties may choose not to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might inhibit settlement. Also, the decision rendered, if any, should not be considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended that the parties and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government would then issue a simplified acquisition (if the dollar amount does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold) for 50% of the agreed price, and the advisor would submit separate invoices (each for 50% of the price) to the Government and the contractor.

        (b) For the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, section 5(a)(6) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2605);

        (c) For the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2396);

        (d) For the Foreign Service Institute, section 704(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4024);

        (e) For the Office of Foreign Missions, section 208(d) of Title II—Authorities Relating to the Regulation of Foreign Missions, of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4308);

        (f) For the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, section 5 of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 296);

        637.104-71   Personal services agreements.

#### § 637.104-71

        (a)  This section applies only to personal services agreements (PSAs) awarded under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c).

        (b)  “Personal Services Agreement (PSA)” is a method of employment using the statutory authority under 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). The Procurement Executive has delegated program management responsibility for PSAs awarded under the Department of State basic authority at 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). When applied to U.S. citizens hired under this authority, the term “PSA Plus” is normally used.

        (c)  DOS contracting officers at overseas posts should not award any personal services contracts that are subject to acquisition statutes and regulations.

        (d)  (1) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, amended section 2(c) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2669(c)) by revising the Department's authority. This language states: “and such contracts are authorized to be negotiated, the terms of the contracts to be prescribed, and the work to be performed, where necessary, without regard to such statutory provisions as relative to the negotiation, making, and performance of contracts and performance of work in the United States.”

        (2) This authority was further amended under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 which added subsection (n) to 22 U.S.C. 2669. This language states “exercise the authority provided in section (c), upon the request of the Secretary of Defense or the head of any other department or agency of the United States, to enter into personal services contracts with individuals to perform services in support of the Department of Defense or such other department or agency, as the case may be.” This authority allowed the use of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) by all other agencies, provided they meet certain criteria and agree to follow certain guidelines laid out in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). That MOA is not signed at the post level, but by a senior official at the Department of State and the other agency. Without the MOA in place, other agencies may not use this basic authority. HR/OE has responsibility for implementation of the authority that came with this legislative change. The HR/OE Web site includes the latest listing of agencies that have signed the MOA and can use this authority.

        (3) This statutory language has continuing effect and provides authority to the Department of State, and now other agencies, if they so agree, to obtain personal services without adherence to acquisition statutes. In furtherance of the authority provided by the statute, the Procurement Executive has waived the applicability of acquisition regulations when obtaining personal services under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). As a result, it is not necessary for the individual executing a PSA under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) to have a contracting officer's certificate of appointment required under FAR 1.603 and 601.603 (see 601.603-3(d)).

        (e)  Only direct hire U.S. citizens may sign PSAs. Provided the individual meets that criterion, individuals who may sign PSAs are limited to the following:

        (1) The Human Resources Officer;

        (2) The Human Resources/Financial Management Officer; or,

        (3) The Management Officer or American FSO designated to perform human resources functions (e.g., GSO, RSO, etc.).

        In addition to the safety/accident prevention requirements of FAR 52.236-13, Accident Prevention Alternate I, the contractor shall comply with the following additional safety measures.

        (a)  If the project contains any of the following high risk activities, the contractor shall follow the section in the latest edition, as of the date of the solicitation, of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health manual, EM 385-1-1, that corresponds to the high risk activity. Before work may proceed, the contractor must obtain approval from the COR of the written safety plan required by FAR 52.236-13, Accident Prevention Alternate I (see paragraph (f) of this clause), containing specific hazard mitigation and control techniques.

        (1) Scaffolding;

        (2) Work at heights above 1.8 meters;

        (3) Trenching or other excavation greater than one (1) meter in depth;

        (4) Earth-moving equipment and other large vehicles;

        (5) Cranes and rigging;

        (6) Welding or cutting and other hot work;

        (7) Partial or total demolition of a structure;

        (8) Temporary wiring, use of portable electric tools, or other recognized electrical hazards. Temporary wiring and portable electric tools require the use of a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) in the affected circuits; other electrical hazards may also require the use of a GFCI;

        (9) Work in confined spaces (limited exits, potential for oxygen less than 19.5 percent or combustible atmosphere, potential for solid or liquid engulfment, or other hazards considered to be immediately dangerous to life or health such as water tanks, transformer vaults, sewers, cisterns, etc.);

        (10) Hazardous materials—a material with a physical or health hazard including but not limited to, flammable, explosive, corrosive, toxic, reactive or unstable, or any operations, which creates any kind of contamination inside an occupied building such as dust from demolition activities, paints, solvents, etc.; or

        (11) Hazardous noise levels as required in EM 385-1 Section 5B or local standards if more restrictive.

        (b)  The contractor and all subcontractors shall comply with the latest edition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health manual EM 385-1-1, or OSHA 29 CFR part 1910 or 1926 if no EM 385-1-1 requirements are applicable, and the accepted contractor's written safety program.

        (c)  The contractor is required to report  all mishaps to the COR and the contracting officer. A “mishap” is any event causing injury, disease or illness, death, material loss or property damage, or incident causing environmental contamination. The mishap reporting requirement shall include fires, explosions, hazardous materials contamination, and other similar incidents that may threaten people, property, and equipment.

        (d)  The contractor shall maintain an accurate record on all mishaps incident to work performed under this contract resulting in death, traumatic injury, occupational disease, or damage to or theft of property, materials, supplies, or equipment. The contractor shall report this data in the manner prescribed by the contracting officer.

        (e)  The contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.

        (f)  The plan required by paragraph (f)(1) of the clause entitled “Accident Prevention Alternate I” shall be known as the Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) and shall address any activities listed in paragraph (a) of this clause, or as otherwise required by the contracting officer/COR.

        (1) The SSHP shall be submitted at least 10 working days prior to commencing any activity at the site.

        (2) The plan must address developing activity hazard analyses (AHAs) for specific tasks. The AHAs shall define the activities being performed and identify the work sequences, the specific anticipated hazards, site conditions, equipment, materials, and the control measures to be implemented to eliminate or reduce each hazard to an acceptable level of risk. Work shall not begin until the AHA for the work activity has been accepted by the COR and discussed with all engaged in the activity, including the Contractor, subcontractor(s), and Government on-site representatives.

        (3) The names of the Competent/Qualified Person(s) required for a particular activity (for example, excavations, scaffolding, fall protection, other activities as specified by EM 385-1-1) shall be identified and included in the AHA. Proof of their competency/qualification shall be submitted to the contracting officer or COR for acceptance prior to the start of that work activity. The AHA shall be reviewed and modified as necessary to address changing site conditions, operations, or change of competent/qualified person(s).
