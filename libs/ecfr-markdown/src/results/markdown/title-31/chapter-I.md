Where a violation is denied, the respondent shall specifically set forth the legal or factual basis upon which the allegation is denied. If the basis of the written response is that the respondent is not the person responsible for the alleged violation, the written response must set forth sufficient information to allow the examining and assessing officials to determine the truth of such an assertion. The written response should include any and all documents and other information that the respondent believes should be a part of the administrative record on the matter.

      (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any written response made under this section must be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment.

      (2) If a request for documents or other evidence is made pursuant to § 92.15(d)(4), the written response must be submitted not later than 20 days after the date of the United States Mint's response to the request.

      (3)(i) In computing the number of days allowed for filing a written response under this paragraph, the first day counted is the day after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment is issued. If the last date on which the response is required to be filed by this paragraph is a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, the response will be due on the next business day after that date.

      (ii) If a response is transmitted by United States mail, it will be deemed timely filed if postmarked on or before the due date.

      (4) The examining official may extend the period for making a written response under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for up to ten days for good cause shown. Requests for extensions beyond ten days must be approved by the assessing official and must be based on good cause shown. Generally, failure to obtain representation in a timely manner will not be considered good cause.

      (c)  The response may be sent by personal delivery, United States mail or commercial delivery. A written response transmitted by means other than United States mail will be considered filed on the date received at the address specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment.

      (d)  The examining official will fully consider the facts and arguments submitted by the respondent in the written response, any other documents filed by the respondent pursuant to this subpart, and the evidence in the United States Mint's record on the matter. If the respondent waives the right to submit a written response in accordance with § 92.15(d)(1), or declines to submit a written response by the end of the 30-day response period, the examining official will fully consider the evidence in the United States Mint's record on the matter.

      (1) In fully considering the matter, the examining official will not consider any evidence introduced into the record by the United States Mint after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment unless and until the respondent has been notified that such additional evidence will be considered, and has had an opportunity to request, review and comment on such evidence.

      (2) The examining official will prepare a concise report, addressed to the assessing official, which will contain the following:

      (i) The entire administrative record on the matter, including all information provided in or with a written response timely filed by the respondent and any additional information provided pursuant to § 92.15(e)(2), as well as all evidence upon which the Initial Notice of Assessment was based, and any additional evidence as provided for in § 92.16(d)(1).

      (ii) A finding, based on the preponderance of the evidence, as to each alleged violation specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment;

      (iii) For each violation that the examining official determines to have occurred, a recommendation as to the appropriate amount of a civil penalty to be imposed which, upon additional consideration of the evidence, may be the same as, more than, or less than the amount initially proposed by the examining official pursuant to § 92.15. In making this recommendation, the examining official will consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:

      (A) The scope of the misuse;

      (B) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;

      (C) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;

      (D) The circumstances of the misuse;

      (E) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and

      (v) Any additional information or considerations that the assessing officer should consider in a decision whether to issue a Final Notice of Assessment under § 92.17.

      § 92.17   Final action.

#### § § 92.17

      (a) In making a final determination whether to impose a penalty, the assessing official shall take into consideration the entire report prepared by the examining official. Although the assessing official should accord appropriate weight to the findings and recommendations of the examining official, the assessing official is not bound by them. The assessing official may approve, disapprove, modify, or substitute any or all of the examining official's findings and recommendations if, in his or her judgment, the evidence in the record supports such a decision. The assessing official will determine whether:

      (1) The facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred; or

      (2)(i) The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and

      (ii) The facts and violations found justify the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed.

      (b) If the assessing official determines that no violation has occurred, the official shall promptly send a letter indicating that determination to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.

      (c) If the assessing official determines that a violation has occurred:

      (1) The assessing official shall issue a Final Notice of Assessment to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.

      (2) The assessing official may, in his or her discretion:

      (i) Impose a civil penalty;

      (ii) Not impose a civil penalty; or

      (iii) Impose a civil penalty and suspend the payment of all or some of the civil penalty, conditioned on the violator's future compliance with 31 U.S.C. 333.

      (3) If a civil penalty is imposed under § 92.17(c)(2)(i) or (iii), the assessing official shall determine the appropriate amount of the penalty in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 333(c)(2). In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the assessing official will consider relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:

      (i) The scope of the misuse;

      (ii) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;

      (iii) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;

      (iv) The circumstances of the misuse;

      (v) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and

      (vi) The repeated nature of the misuse.

      (4) The Final Notice of Assessment shall:

      (i) Include the following:

      (A) A specific reference to each provision of § 92.13 found to have been violated;

      (B) A concise statement of the facts supporting a conclusion that each violation has occurred;

      (C) An analysis of how the facts and each violation justifies the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed; and

      (D) The amount of each civil penalty imposed and a statement as to how the amount of each penalty was determined; and

      (ii) Inform the person of the following:

      (A) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment must be made within 30 days of the date of the notice;

      (B) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment shall be paid by EFT in accordance with instructions provided in the notice, unless the assessing official has given written approval to have payment made by other means;

      (C) If payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment has been suspended on the condition that the person comply in the future with 31 U.S.C. 333 and this subpart, the failure by the person to so comply will make the civil penalty payable on demand;

      (D) If a civil penalty is not paid within 30 days of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment (or on demand under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), a civil action to collect the penalty or enforce compliance may be commenced at any time within two years of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment; and

      (E) Any civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment may be subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 701

      § 92.18   Judicial review.

    (ii) Otherwise prevent or prohibit the acceptance of the products or services of the designated payment system or participant in connection with restricted transactions; and

    (2) Such policies and procedures of the designated payment system comply with the requirements of this part.

    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) in this section, a participant in a designated payment system may rely on a written statement or notice by the operator of that designated payment system to its participants that states that the operator has designed or structured the system's policies and procedures for identifying and blocking or otherwise preventing or prohibiting restricted transactions to comply with the requirements of this part as conclusive evidence that the system's policies and procedures comply with the requirements of this part, unless the participant is notified otherwise by its Federal functional regulator or, in the case of participants that are not directly supervised by a Federal functional regulator, the Federal Trade Commission.

    (d) As provided in the Act, a person that identifies and blocks a transaction, prevents or prohibits the acceptance of its products or services in connection with a transaction, or otherwise refuses to honor a transaction, shall not be liable to any party for such action if—

In establishing and implementing written policies and procedures to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, a non-exempt participant in a designated payment system is permitted to design and implement policies and procedures tailored to its business that may be different than the examples provided in this section. In addition, non-exempt participants may use different policies and procedures with respect to different business lines or different parts of the organization.

    (b)  If a non-exempt participant in a designated payment system establishes and implements procedures for due diligence of its commercial customer accounts or commercial customer relationships in order to comply, in whole or in part, with the requirements of this regulation, those due diligence procedures will be deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if the procedures include the steps set out in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

    (1) At the establishment of the account or relationship, the participant conducts due diligence of a commercial customer and its activities commensurate with the participant's judgment of the risk of restricted transactions presented by the customer's business.

    (i) The participant determines that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business.

    (ii) The participant cannot determine that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business, in which case it obtains the documentation in either paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section—

    (A) Certification from the commercial customer that it does not engage in an Internet gambling business; or

    (B) If the commercial customer does engage in an Internet gambling business, each of the following—

    () Evidence of legal authority to engage in the Internet gambling business, such as—

    () A copy of the commerc_i_al customer's license that expressly authorizes the customer to engage in the Internet gambling business issued by the appropriate State or Tribal authority or, if the commercial customer does not have such a license, a reasoned legal opinion that demonstrates that the commercial customer's Internet gambling business does not involve restricted transactions; and

    () A written commitment by the commercial customer to notify the participant of any changes in its legal authority to engage in its Internet gambling business.

    () A third-party certification that the commercial customer's systems for engaging in the Internet gambling business are reasonably designed to ensure that the commercial customer's Internet gambling business will remain within the licensed or otherwise lawful limits, including with respect to age and location verification.

    (3) The participant notifies all of its commercial customers, through provisions in the account or commercial customer relationship agreement or otherwise, that restricted transactions are prohibited from being processed through the account or relationship.

    (4) With respect to the determination in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, participants may deem the following commercial customers to present a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business—

    (i) An entity that is directly supervised by a Federal functional regulator as set out in § 132.7(a); or

    (ii) An agency, department, or division of the Federal government or a State government.

    (c)  (1) The policies and procedures of the originating depository financial institution and any third party processor in an ACH debit transaction, and the receiving depository financial institution and any third party processor in an ACH credit transaction, are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they—

    (i) Address methods to conduct due diligence in establishing a commercial customer account or relationship as set out in § 132.6(b);

    (ii) Address methods to conduct due diligence as set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the participant has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer of the participant engages in an Internet gambling business; and

    (iii) Include procedures to be followed with respect to a commercial customer if the originating depository financial institution or third-party processor has actual knowledge that its commercial customer has originated restricted transactions as ACH debit transactions or if the receiving depository financial institution or third-party processor has actual knowledge that its commercial customer has received restricted transactions as ACH credit transactions, such as procedures that address—

    (A) The circumstances under which the commercial customer should not be allowed to originate ACH debit transactions or receive ACH credit transactions; and

    (B) The circumstances under which the account should be closed.

    (2) The policies and procedures of a receiving gateway operator and third-party processor that receives instructions to originate an ACH debit transaction directly from a foreign sender are deemed to be reasonably designed to prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they include procedures to be followed with respect to a foreign sender if the receiving gateway operator or third-party processor has actual knowledge, obtained through notification by a government entity, such as law enforcement or a regulatory agency, that such instructions included instructions for restricted transactions. Such procedures may address sending notification to the foreign sender, such as in the form of the notice contained in appendix A to this part.

    (d)  The policies and procedures of a card system operator, a merchant acquirer, third-party processor, or a card issuer, are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, if the policies and procedures—

    (A) The operational functionality to enable the card system operator or the card issuer to reasonably identify and deny authorization for a transaction that the coding procedure indicates may be a restricted transaction; and

    (B) Procedures for ongoing monitoring or testing by the card system operator to detect potential restricted transactions, including—

    () Conducting testing to ascertain whether transaction authorization requests are coded correctly; and

    () Monitoring and analyzing payment patterns to detect suspicious payment volumes from a merchant customer; and

    (2) For the card system operator, merchant acquirer, or third-party processor, include procedures to be followed when the participant has actual knowledge that a merchant has received restricted transactions through the card system, such as—

    (i) The circumstances under which the access to the card system for the merchant, merchant acquirer, or third-party processor should be denied; and

    (ii) The circumstances under which the merchant account should be closed.

    (e)  (1) The policies and procedures of a depositary bank are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, if they—

    (i) Address methods for the depositary bank to conduct due diligence in establishing a commercial customer account or relationship as set out in § 132.6(b);

    (ii) Address methods for the depositary bank to conduct due diligence as set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the depositary bank has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer engages in an Internet gambling business; and

Such procedures may address sending notification to the foreign banking office, such as in the form of the notice contained in the appendix to this part.

    (f)  The policies and procedures of an operator of a money transmitting business are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they—

    (1) Address methods for the operator to conduct due diligence in establishing a commercial customer relationship as set out in § 132.6(b);

    (2) Address methods for the operator to conduct due diligence as set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the operator has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer engages in an Internet gambling business;

    (i) The circumstances under which money transmitting services should be denied to that commercial customer; and

    (ii) The circumstances under which the commercial customer account should be closed.

    (c) Any company that the Department determines is an assessed company on a given determination date will be an assessed company for the entire assessment period related to such determination date, and will be subject to the full assessment fee for that assessment period, regardless of any changes in the company's assets or other attributes that occur after the determination date.

    (b) The Department will allocate the assessment basis to the assessed companies in the following manner:

    (2) States the total assessable assets that the Department has determined will be used for calculating the company's assessment.

    (b) If a company that is required to make an assessment payment for a given assessment period believes that the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section contains an error, the company may provide the Department with a written request for a revised statement. Such request must be received by the Department via email within 30 calendar days and must include all facts that the company requests the Department to consider. The Department will respond to all such requests within 21 calendar days of receipt thereof.

    (c) No later than the 14 calendar days prior to the payment date for a given assessment period, the Department will send an electronic billing notification to each assessed company, containing the final assessment that is required to be paid by such assessed company.

    (d) For the purpose of making the payments described in § 150.5, each assessed company shall designate a deposit account for direct debit by the Department through  or successor website. No later than the later of 30 days prior to the payment date for an assessment period, or April 17, 2020, each such company shall provide notice to the Department of the account designated, including all information and authorizations required by the Department for direct debit of the account. After the initial notice of the designated account, no further notice is required unless the company designates a different account for assessment debit by the Department, in which case the requirements of the preceding sentence apply.

    (e) Each assessed company shall take all actions necessary to allow the Department to debit assessments from such company's designated deposit account. Each such company shall, prior to each assessment payment date, ensure that funds in an amount at least equal to the amount on the relevant electronic billing notification are available in the designated deposit account for debit by the Department. Failure to take any such action or to provide such funding of the account shall be deemed to constitute nonpayment of the assessment. The Department will cause the amount stated in the applicable electronic billing notification to be directly debited on the appropriate payment date from the deposit account so designated.

    (f) In the event that, for a given assessment period, an assessed company materially misstates or misrepresents any information that is used by the Department in calculating that company's total assessable assets, the Department may at any time re-calculate the assessment payable by that company for that assessment period, and the assessed company shall take all actions necessary to allow the Department to immediately debit any additional payable amounts from such assessed company's designated deposit account.

    (g) If a due date under this section falls on a date that is not a business day, the applicable date shall be the next business day.
