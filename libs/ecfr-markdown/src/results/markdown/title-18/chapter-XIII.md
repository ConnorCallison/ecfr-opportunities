    In accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2), TVA has exempted the following financial interests of its employees from the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) upon the ground that such interests are too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of such employees' services. When any of the following exemptions applies only to a limited range of official actions, rather than all official acts, the range of actions will be specified within the language of the exemption.

    (a) An investment in a business enterprise in the form of ownership of bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtness which are not convertible into shares of preferred or common stock and have no warrants attached entitling the holder to purchase stock provided that the estimated market value of the interest does not exceed $5,000;

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552 and 552a; 16 U.S.C. 831-831dd.

**Source:** Source: 64 FR 4044, Jan. 27, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Freedom of Information Act

**Source:** Source: 82 FR 41511, Sept. 1, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1301.1   General provisions.

#### § § 1301.1

      (a) This subpart contains the rules that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with TVA's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this subpart.

      (a) [Reserved]

      § 1301.2   Proactive disclosures.

#### § § 1301.2

      Records that the FOIA requires agencies to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the TVA Web site. Each TVA organization is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each TVA organization shall ensure that its posted records and indices are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. TVA has a FOIA Requester Service Center and a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating TVA records. Contact information for the FOIA Requester Service Center and Public Liaison is available at .

      § 1301.3   Requirements for making requests.

#### § § 1301.3

      (a)  (1) TVA has a centralized system for responding to FOIA requests. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Tennessee Valley Authority, FOIA Officer, 400 W. Summit Hill Drive (WT 7D), Knoxville, TN 37902-1401. TVA's Guide to Information, which may be accessed on the TVA Web site at  may be helpful in making your request.

      (2) If you are making a request about yourself, see subpart B Privacy Act for additional requirements.

      (3) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased ( a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, TVA may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

      (b)  Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable TVA personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help TVA identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the TVA's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the agency determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency shall inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the agency's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.

      (c)  Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. TVA will accommodate your request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.

      (d)  Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the agency in communicating with them and providing released records.

      § 1301.4   Responsibility for responding to requests.

#### § § 1301.4

      (a)  TVA's FOIA Officer or the FOIA Officer's designee is responsible for responding to all FOIA requests. In determining which records are responsive to a request, TVA ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the agency will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.

      (b)  TVA's FOIA Officer or the FOIA Officer's designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by TVA.

      (c)  When reviewing records located by TVA in response to a request, TVA will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, TVA shall proceed in one of the following ways:

      (1)  When records originated with the agency processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the agency processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.

      (2)  (i) When the agency processing the request believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the agency typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the agency processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

      (ii) Whenever an agency refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

      (3)  The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the agency that received the request should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.

      (d)  On receipt of any request involving classified information, the agency must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving agency must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the agency must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.

      (e)  All consultations and referrals received by TVA will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.

      (f)  TVA may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

      § 1301.5   Timing of responses to requests.

#### § § 1301.5

      (a)  TVA ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt and placement in an appropriate processing track as follows.

      (b)  TVA has established three tracks for handling requests and the track to which a request is assigned will depend on the nature of the request and the estimated processing time. Among the factors TVA may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. TVA will also designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. TVA will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

      (1)  Requests that can be answered with readily available records or information. These are the fastest to process. These requests ordinarily will be responded to within 20 working days of receipt of a proper request by the FOIA Officer. The 20 working day time limit provided in this paragraph may be extended by TVA for unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, upon written notice to the person requesting the records.

      (2)  Requests where we need records or information from other offices throughout TVA, where we must consult with other Government agencies, or when we must process a submitter notice as described in § 1301.8(d), but we do not expect that the decision on disclosure will be as time consuming as for requests in Track 3.

      (3)  Requests which require a decision or input from another office or agency, extensive submitter notifications because of the presence of Business Information as defined in § 1301.8(b)(1), and a considerable amount of time will be needed for that, or the request is complicated or involves a large number of records. Usually, these requests will take the longest to process.

      (c)  Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” and TVA extends the time limit on that basis, TVA will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which TVA estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, TVA will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at . TVA will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonable necessary to the proper processing of the particular requests:

      (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

      (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

      (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

      (d)  To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, TVA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. TVA cannot aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

      (e)  (1) TVA will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

      (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

      (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;

      (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.

      (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. For a prompt determination, requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section should be submitted to the TVA FOIA Officer. Requests based on paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section should be submitted in accordance with the agency's requirements as described in § 1301.3. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the TVA Chief FOIA Officer and Appeals Official.

      (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, TVA may waive the formal certification requirement.

      (4) TVA will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the agency must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.

      § 1301.6   Responses to requests.

#### § § 1301.6

      (a)  TVA, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the Internet electronically, such as email.

      (b)  TVA will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. TVA will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

      (c)  Upon request, TVA will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, TVA may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.

      (d)  Once TVA determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. TVA will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1301.11 of this subpart and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.

      (e)  If TVA makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing. In the event of an adverse determination, TVA will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance to requesters.

      (f)  The denial must be signed by the head of the agency or their designee and must include:

      (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;

      (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying the request;

      (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and

      (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1301.9(a) of this subpart, and a description of the appeal requirements.

      (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.

      (g)  Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.

      (h)  (1) In the event that TVA identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), TVA will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy, to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.

      (2) If an exclusion is invoked, TVA will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.

      § 1301.7   Exempt records.

#### § § 1301.7

      (a) TVA's records will be disclosed to any person upon request as provided in this section, except records that are exempt and are not made available if they are:

      (1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and

      (ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

      (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

      (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute—

      (i)(A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or

      (B) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and

      (ii) If enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.

      (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

      (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

      (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information—

      (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,

      (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,

      (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

      (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source,

      (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or

      (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

      (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

      (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

      (b) The availability of certain classes of nonexempt records is deferred for such time as TVA may determine is reasonable necessary to avoid interference with the accomplishment of its statutory responsibilities. Such records include bids and information concerning the identity and number of bids received prior to bid opening and award; and all negotiations in progress involving contracts or agreements for the acquisition or disposal of real or personal property by TVA prior to the conclusion of such negotiations. Any reasonably segregable portion of an available record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this paragraph.

      § 1301.8   Confidential commercial information.

#### § § 1301.8

      (a) —(1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by TVA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

      (2)  means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

      (b)  A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

      (c)  (1) TVA will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if TVA determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

      (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (ii) TVA has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

      (2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the agency may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.

      (d)  The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

      (1) TVA determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

      (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

      (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, TVA will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

      (e)  (1) TVA will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide TVA a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.

      (3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. TVA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (f)  TVA will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

      (g)  Whenever TVA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, TVA will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

      (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as TVA intends to release them; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice.

      (h)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, TVA will promptly notify the submitter.

      (i)  TVA will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

      § 1301.9   Appeals.

#### § § 1301.9

      (a)  A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to TVA's office designated to receive FOIA appeals (FOIA Appeals Office). Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 1301.6(e) of this subpart. Requesters can submit appeals by mail to TVA FOIA Appeals Official, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 W. Summit Hill Drive (WT 7C), Knoxville, TN 37902-1401. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked within 90 calendar days after the date of the initial response. The appeal should clearly identify the agency determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

      (b)  (1) The TVA Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official or designee will act on all appeals under this section.

      (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

      (3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.

      (c)  TVA will provide its decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds TVA's determination in whole or in part must contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If TVA's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, TVA will notify the requester of that determination in writing. TVA will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.

      (d)  Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If TVA agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

      (e)  Before seeking review by a court of TVA's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

      § 1301.10   Preservation of records.

#### § § 1301.10

      TVA will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. TVA will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.

      § 1301.11   Fees.

#### § § 1301.11

      (a)  (1) TVA will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

      (i) Commercial use requesters;

      (ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

      (iii) All other requesters.

      (2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. TVA will consider requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, TVA may contact a requester for additional information. TVA will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. TVA ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Tennessee Valley Authority, or by another method as determined by TVA.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. TVA's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. TVA will notify requesters of their placement in this category.

      (2) Direct costs are those expenses that TVA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work ( the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

      (3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

      (4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. TVA may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (7) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

      (8) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1301.7 of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, TVA will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, agencies should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

      (1)  (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. TVA will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

      (ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: For time spent by clerical employees, the charge is $14.90 per hour. For time spent by supervisory and professional employees, the charge is $34.30 per hour.

      (iii) TVA will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. TVA must notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

      (iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by TVA at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), TVA will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

      (2)  TVA will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where TVA can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, TVA will provide one copy per request at the cost of 10 cents per page for sheets no larger than 8  by 14 inches. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, TVA will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, TVA will charge the direct costs.

      (3)  TVA will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by TVA to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with an agency's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (d)  (1) When TVA determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.

      (2)(i) If TVA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in responding to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

      (ii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

      (iii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, TVA may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. TVA must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and TVA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, TVA may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

      (iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

      (4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, TVA must provide without charge:

      (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

      (ii) The first two hours of search.

      (5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.

      (e)  (1) When TVA determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, TVA will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, TVA will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

      (2) If TVA notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. TVA is not required to accept payments in installments.

      (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but TVA estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, TVA will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. TVA will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

      (4) TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

      (f)  Although not required to provide special services, if TVA chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

      (g)  TVA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by TVA. TVA must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (h)  When TVA reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, TVA may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. TVA may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, TVA will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

      (i)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, TVA cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (2) When TVA determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. TVA may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

      (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, TVA may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and TVA may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before TVA begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where TVA has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

      (4) In cases in which TVA requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of TVA's fee determination, the request will be closed.

      (j)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, TVA will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

      (k)  (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) TVA will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

      (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

      (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. TVA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

      (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, TVA will consider the following criteria:

      (A) TVA must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

      (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, TVA must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. TVA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

      (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.

      (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to TVA and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

      § 1301.12   Other rights and services.

#### § § 1301.12

      Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.

They provide procedures by which an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Act to determine whether a TVA system contains a record pertaining to him; to gain access to such records; to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof; and to request administrative correction or amendment of such records. They prescribe fees to be charged for copying records; establish identification requirements; list penalties provided by statute for certain violations of the Act; and establish exemptions from certain requirements of the Act for certain TVA systems or components thereof.

      (b) Nothing in §§ 1301.21 to 1301.34 entitles an individual to any access to any information or record compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

      (c) Certain records of which TVA may have physical possession are the official records of another government agency which exercises dominion and control over the records, their content, and access thereto. In such cases, TVA's maintenance of the records is subject to the direction of the other government agency. Except for a request for a determination of the existence of the record, when TVA receives requests related to these records, TVA will immediately refer the request to the controlling agency for all decisions regarding the request, and will notify the individual making the request of the referral.

      § 1301.23   Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system.

#### § § 1301.23

      (a) An individual may, in accordance with this section (1) request a TVA determination whether a record retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier is maintained in a TVA system, and (2) request access to such a record. A request for determination may be combined with a request for access.

      (b) Requests under this section shall:

      (1) Be in writing and signed by the individual seeking the determination or access;

      (2) Include the individual's mailing address;

      (3) Name the TVA system as listed in the TVA system notice;

      (4) Include any additional identifying information specified in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the applicable TVA system notice;

      (5) Specify whether the request is for determination only or for both determination and access; and

      (6) Include such proof of identity as may be required by § 1301.24 and the applicable system notice. Requests may be presented in person or by mail. In-person requests shall be presented during normal TVA business hours, as set out in § 1301.24(g).

      (c) Requests for determination only shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Requests for both determination and access shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Access procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Certain TVA system notices designate officials at field locations of TVA systems. With respect to such TVA systems, an individual who believes his record is located at the field location may present a request to the designated official at the field location. If the record is not available at that field location, the request will be forwarded to the appropriate TVA office.

      (d) If a request is for determination only, the determination will normally be made within 10 days after receipt of the request. If the determination cannot be made within 10 days after receipt of a request, the designated official will acknowledge the request in writing and state when the determination will be made. Upon making a determination, the designated official will notify the individual making the request whether the record exists. The notice will include any additional information necessary to enable the individual to request access to the record.

      (e) A request which includes a request for access will be acknowledged within 10 days after receipt. If access can be granted as requested, the acknowledgment will provide a time and place for disclosure of the requested record. Disclosure will normally be made within 30 days of the date of the acknowledgement, but the designated official may extend the 30-day period for reasons found by him to be good cause. In case of an extension, TVA will notify the individual, in writing, that disclosure will be delayed, the reasons for delay, and the anticipated date on which the individual may expect the record to be disclosed. TVA will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests for disclosure at specified times and dates, as set forth in a request for access, so far as compatible with the conduct of TVA business.

      § 1301.24   Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

#### § § 1301.24

      (a) TVA will require proof of identity, in accordance with this section, before it will disclose a record under § 1301.25 of this part to an individual requesting access to the record, and before it will disclose the existence of a record to a requester under § 1301.23 of this part, if TVA determines that disclosure of the existence of such record would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

      (b) Identification normally required would be an identification card such as a valid state driver's license or TVA or other employee identification card. A comparison of the signature of the requester with either the signature on the card or a signature in the record may be used to confirm identity.

      (c) Because of the sensitivity of the subject matter in a TVA system, a TVA system notice may prescribe special identification requirements for the disclosure of the existence of or access to records in that TVA system. In such case, the special identification requirements prescribed in the TVA system notice shall apply in lieu of those prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) If TVA deems it warranted by the nature of identification presented, the subject matter of the material to be disclosed, or other reasons found by TVA to be sufficient, TVA may require the individual requesting access to sign a statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.

      (e) Where TVA is requested to provide access to records by mailing copies of records to the requester, the request shall contain or be accompanied by adequate identifying information to make it likely the requester is the person he purports to be and a notarized statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.

      (f) Where sensitivity of record information may warrant (i.e., unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual) or disclosure by mail to third persons is requested, TVA may require in-person confirmation of identity.

An appeal must be taken within 20 days of receipt of notice of TVA's initial refusal to amend the record and is taken by delivering a written notice of appeal to the Privacy Act Reviewing Official, Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902-1401. Such notice shall be signed by the appellant and shall state:

      (2) The reasons why the appellant believes the denial to have been erroneous;

      (3) The date on which the denial was issued; and

      (4) The date on which the denial was received by the appellant.

      (b) Appeals shall be determined by a reviewing official. Such determination may be based on information provided for the initial determination; any additional information which TVA or the appellant may desire to provide; and any other material the reviewing official deems relevant to the determination. The reviewing official, in his sole discretion, may request TVA or the appellant to provide additional information deemed relevant to the appeal. The appellant will be given an opportunity to respond to any information provided by TVA or independently procured by the reviewing official. If in the sole discretion of the reviewing official a hearing is deemed necessary for resolution of the appeal, the reviewing official may conduct a hearing upon notice to TVA and the appellant, at which both TVA and the appellant shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the appeal. The rules governing any hearing will be set forth in the notice of hearing.

      (c) The reviewing official shall make final determination on the appeal within 30 days after it is received unless such period is extended for good cause. If the reviewing official finds good cause for an extension, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of the reason for the delay and of the approximate date on which the reviewing official expects to complete his determination of the appeal.

      (d) If the reviewing official determines that a record should be amended in whole or in part in accordance with an appellant's request, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of its determination and correct or amend the record. If an accounting of disclosures has been made, TVA will, to the extent of the accounting, inform prior recipients of the record of the fact that the correction was made and of the substance of the correction.

      (e) If the reviewing official determines not to amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with a request, TVA will advise the individual:

      (1) Of its refusal to amend and the reasons therefor;

      (2) Of the appellant's right to file a concise statement of reasons for disagreement with the refusal as set out in paragraph (f) of this section;

      (3) Of the procedures for filing a statement of disagreement;

      (4) That any statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with any statement by TVA summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record;

      (5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained; and

      (6) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to amend a record.

      (f) If the reviewing official's final determination of an appeal is a refusal to correct or amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with the request, the appellant may file with TVA a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of TVA to amend the records. Such statements normally should not exceed 100 words. A statement of disagreement should be submitted within 30 days of receipt of notice of the reviewing official's decision on the appeal, and should be sent to system manager. In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement which occurs after the filing of the statement, TVA will clearly note any portion of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement with the disclosure. Copies of the statement will also be furnished to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was made. TVA may attach to the statement of disagreement a brief summary of TVA's reasons for refusing to amend the record. Such summaries will be disclosed to the individual, but are not subject to amendment.

      § 1301.34   Specific exemptions.

#### § § 1301.34

      (a) The TVA system Nuclear Access Authorization and Fitness for Duty Records is exempt from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); and (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 522a (section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974) to the extent that disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, and to the extent that disclosure of testing or examination material would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. This exemption is pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(5) and (6).

      (b)(1) The TVA systems “Apprentice Training Record System-TVA,” “Consultant and Contractor Records-TVA,” “Employment Applicant Files-TVA,” “Personnel Files-TVA,” and “Nuclear Quality Assurance Personnel Records-TVA” are exempted from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and corresponding sections of these rules to the extent that disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. These TVA systems are exempted pursuant to section (k)(5) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act).

      (2) Each of these TVA systems contain reference letters and information concerning employees and other individuals who perform services for TVA. TVA has received this information in the past under both express and implied promises of confidentiality and consistent with the Privacy Act these promises will be honored. Pledges of confidentiality will be necessary in the future to ensure that unqualified or unsuitable individuals are not selected for TVA positions. Without the ability to make these promises, a potential source of information may be unwilling to provide needed information, or may not be sufficiently frank to be of value in personnel screening.

      (c)(1) The TVA systems “Apprentice Training Record System-TVA,” “Consultant and Contractor Records-TVA,” “Employment Applicant Files-TVA,” and “Personnel Files-TVA,” are exempted from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and corresponding sections of these rules to the extent that disclosure of testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. These systems are exempted pursuant to section (k)(6) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act).

      (2) This material is exempted because its disclosure would reveal information about the testing process which would potentially give an individual an unfair competitive advantage in selection based on test performance.

      (d) The TVA system OIG Investigative Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act) and corresponding sections of these rules pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The TVA system OIG Investigative Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). This system is exempt because application of these provisions might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations, lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence, disclose investigative techniques or procedures, reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses, or otherwise impair investigations.

      (e) The TVA system TVA Police Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act) and corresponding sections of these rules pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The TVA system Police Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). This system is exempt because application of these provisions might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations, lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence, disclose investigative techniques or procedures, reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses, or otherwise impair investigations.

A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to § 1301.46 or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under § 1301.46. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.

      (b) Notwithstanding that the members may have already voted not to close a meeting, whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the agency close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraphs (e), (f), or (g) of § 1301.46, the Board, upon request of any one of its members made prior to the commencement of such portion, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such portion of the meeting.

      (a)  TVA's practice is to provide requested testimony of TVA employees by affidavit only. TVA will provide affidavit testimony in response to demands for such testimony, provided all requirements of this part are met and there is no compelling factor under paragraph (c) of this section that requires the testimony to be withheld. The General Counsel may waive this restriction when necessary.

      (c)  The General Counsel shall consider the following factors, among others, in deciding whether requested testimony or materials must be withheld:

      (1) Whether production is appropriate in light of any relevant privilege;

      (3) Whether the material requested is relevant to the matter at issue;

      (4) Whether allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

      (5) Whether disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order, or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a;

      (6) Whether disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights or national security interests;

      (7) Whether disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets or proprietary confidential information without the owner's consent;

      (8) Whether disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of TVA's functions;

      (9) Whether the records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;

      (10) Whether disclosure would result in TVA appearing to favor one litigant over another;

      (11) Whether the demand or request is within the authority of the party making it; and

      (12) Whether a substantial Government interest is implicated.

      (d)  When necessary or appropriate, the General Counsel may impose restrictions or conditions on the production of testimony or records or official information. These restrictions may include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Limiting the area of testimony;

      (2) Requiring that the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding agree to keep the testimony under seal;

The General Counsel will notify the requesting party and, when necessary, the court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the production of testimony or records or official information.

      § 1301.57   Waiver.

#### § § 1301.57

      The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of TVA or the United States, or for other good cause.

    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford that individual an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program.

    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.

    (4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of the financial assistance.

    (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies, the recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.

    § 1302.5   Assurances required.

#### § § 1302.5

    (a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with this part in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreements, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.

    (b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which is acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

    § 1302.6   Compliance information.

#### § § 1302.6

    (a)  TVA shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

    (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to TVA timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as TVA may determined to be necessary to enable it to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

    (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by TVA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

    (d)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner as TVA finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

    § 1302.7   Compliance reviews and conduct of investigations.

#### § § 1302.7

    (a)  (1) Prior to approval of financial assistance, TVA will make a determination as to whether the proposed recipient is in compliance with Title VI and the requirements of this part with respect to a program or activity for which it is seeking Federal financial assistance from TVA. The basis for such a determination shall be submission of an assurance of compliance and a review of the data and information submitted by the proposed recipient, any relevant compliance review reports on file with TVA, and any other information available to TVA. Where a determination cannot be made from this data, TVA will require the submission of necessary additional information and may take additional steps. Such additional steps may include, for example, communicating with local government officials, protected class organizations, and onsite reviews.

    (2) No proposed recipient shall be approved unless it is determined that the proposed recipient is in compliance with Title VI and this part or has agreed in writing to take necessary specified steps within a stated period of time to come into compliance with Title VI and this part. Such an agreement must be approved by TVA and made a part of the conditions of the agreement under which the financial assistance is provided.

    (3)(i) Where TVA finds that a proposed recipient may not be in compliance with Title VI and this part, TVA shall notify the proposed recipient and the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in writing of:

    (A) The preliminary findings setting forth the alleged noncompliance;

    (B) Suggested actions for correcting the alleged noncompliance; and

    (C) The fact that the proposed recipient has 10 days to correct the alleged noncompliance or to provide during this time a written submission responding to or rebutting the preliminary findings or suggested corrective actions set forth in the notice.

    (ii) If within this 10-day period the proposed recipient has not agreed to the suggested actions set forth or to other actions that would correct the alleged noncompliance under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, or the preliminary findings set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section have not been rebutted to TVA's satisfaction, or voluntary compliance has not been otherwise secured, TVA shall make a formal determination of compliance or noncompliance, notify the proposed recipient, and the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and institute proceedings (including provision of an opportunity for a hearing) under § 1302.8 of this part.

    (b)  (1) TVA may periodically conduct compliance reviews of selected recipients in their programs or activities receiving TVA financial assistance, including the request of data and information, and may conduct onsite reviews where it has reason to believe that discrimination may be occurring in such programs or activities.

    (2) Selection for review shall be made on the basis of the following criteria among others:

    (i) The number and nature of discrimination complaints filed against a recipient with TVA or other Federal agencies;

    (ii) The scope of the problem revealed by an investigation commenced on the basis of a complaint filed with TVA against a recipient; and

    (iii) The amount of assistance provided to the recipient.

    (3) Within 15 days after selection of a recipient for review, TVA shall inform the recipient that it has been selected for review. The review will ordinarily be initiated by a letter requesting data pertinent to the review and advising the recipient of:

    (i) The practices to be reviewed;

    (ii) The programs or activities affected by the review;

    (iii) The opportunity to make, at any time prior to receipt of the final TVA findings with respect to the review pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a documentary submission responding to TVA which explains, validates, or otherwise addresses the practices under review; and

    (iv) The schedule under which the review will be conducted and a determination of compliance or noncompliance made.

    (4) Within 180 days of initiation of a review, TVA shall advise the recipient, in writing of:

    (i) Its preliminary findings;

    (ii) Where appropriate, recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance;

    (iii) The opportunity to request TVA to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations prior to TVA's final determination of compliance or noncompliance. TVA shall notify the Assistant Attorney General at the time it notifies the recipient of any matter where recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance are made.

    (5) TVA's General Manager may extend the 180-day period set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for good cause shown.

    (6) If, within 50 days of the recipient's notification under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, TVA's recommendations for compliance are not met or voluntary compliance is not secured, and the preliminary findings have not been rebutted to TVA's satisfaction, TVA shall make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance. The determination is to be made no later than 14 days after the conclusion of the 50-day negotiation period. TVA's General Manager may extend the 14-day period for good cause shown.

    (7) Where TVA makes a formal determination of noncompliance on a postaward review, the recipient and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately notified in writing of the determination and of the fact that the recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10 days, TVA shall institute proceedings under § 1302.8 of this part.

    (8) All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by TVA and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.

    (c)  (1) TVA shall investigate complaints of discrimination in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA that allege a violation of Title VI or this part.

    (2) No complaint will be investigated if it is received by TVA more than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination unless the time for filing is extended by TVA for good cause shown. Where a complaint is accepted for investigation, TVA will initiate an investigation. The complainant shall be notified in writing as to whether the complaint has been accepted or rejected.

    (3) TVA shall conduct investigations of complaints as follows:

    (i) Within 10 days of receipt of a complaint, the Director of Equal Opportunity Compliance shall:

    (A) Determine whether TVA has jurisdiction under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section;

    (B) If jurisdiction is not found, wherever possible refer the complaint to the Federal agency with such jurisdiction and advise the complainant;

    (C) If jurisdiction is found, notify the recipient alleged to be in violation of the receipt and acceptance of the complaint; and

    (D) Initiate the investigation.

    (ii) The investigation will ordinarily be initiated by a letter to the recipient requesting data pertinent to the complaint and informing the recipient of:

    (A) The nature of the complaint, and with the written consent of the complainant, the identity of the complainant;

    (B) The programs or activities affected by the complaint;

    (C) The opportunity to make, at any time prior to receipt of TVA's final findings under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a documentary submission, responding to, rebutting, or denying the allegations made in the complaint; and

    (D) The schedule under which the complaint will be investigated and a determination of compliance or noncompliance made.

    (iii) Within 180 days of the initiation of a complaint investigation, TVA shall advise the recipient, in writing, of:

    (A) Preliminary findings;

    (B) Where appropriate, recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance; and

    (C) The opportunity to request TVA to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations prior to TVA's final determination of compliance or noncompliance. TVA shall notify the Assistant Attorney General at the time the recipient is notified of any matter where recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance are made.

    (4) If, within 50 days of the recipient's notification under paragraph (c) of this section, TVA's recommendations for compliance are not met, or voluntary compliance is not secured, and the preliminary findings have not been rebutted to TVA's satisfaction, TVA shall make a formal determination of compliance or noncompliance. The determination is to be made no later than 14 days after conclusion of a 50-day negotiation period. TVA's General Manager may extend the 14-day period for good cause shown.

    (5) Where TVA makes a formal determination of noncompliance, the complainant, the recipient, and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately notified in writing of the determination and of the fact that the recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10 days, TVA shall institute proceedings under § 1302.8 of this part. The complainant shall also be notified of any action taken including the closing of the complaint or the achievement of voluntary compliance. All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by TVA and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient and shall be made available to the complainant on request.

    (6) If the complainant or party other than TVA has filed suit in Federal or State court alleging the same discrimination as alleged in a complaint pending before TVA, and if during TVA's investigation the trial of that suit would be in progress, TVA will consult with the Assistant Attorney General and court records to determine the need to continue or suspend the investigation and will monitor the litigation through the court docket and contacts with the complainant. Upon receipt of notice that the court has made a finding of discrimination against a recipient that would constitute a violation of this part, TVA shall institute proceedings as specified in § 1302.8 of this part. All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by TVA and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.

    (7) The time limits listed in paragraphs (c) (3) through (5) of this section shall be appropriately adjusted where TVA requests another Federal agency to act on the complaint. TVA shall monitor the progress of the matter through liaison with the other agency. Where the request to act does not result in timely resolution of the matter, TVA shall institute appropriate proceedings as required by this part.

    (d)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of Title VI or this part, or because such individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this regulation, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

    (e)  TVA's Director of Equal Opportunity Compliance, or a successor as designated by TVA's Board of Directors, will be responsible for all decisions about initiating compliance reviews and complaint investigations. TVA's General Manager, or a successor as designated by TVA's Board of Directors, shall be responsible for all decisions about initiating compliance actions under § 1302.8(a) of this part.

    § 1302.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 1302.8

    (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this regulation may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to,

    (1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act),

    (2) Institution of appropriate proceedings by TVA to enforce the provisions of the agreement of financial assistance or of any deed or instrument relating thereto, and

    (3) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

    (b)  If anyone requesting financial assistance declines to furnish the assurance required under § 1302.5 of this part, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section and for such purposes, the term “recipient” shall be deemed to include one which has been denied financial assistance. TVA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that TVA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an agreement therefor entered into with TVA prior to the effective date of this part.

    (c)  No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue financial assistance shall become effective until (1) TVA has advised the recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, or a failure by the recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the TVA Board pursuant to § 1302.9, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the TVA Board has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

    (d)  No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) TVA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

    § 1302.9   Hearings.

#### § § 1302.9

    (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1302.7(b), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected recipient. This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1302.7(b) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

    (b)  Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the TVA Board, or a member thereof, or, at the discretion of the Board, before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.

    (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the recipient and TVA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

    (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with the procedures contained in 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act) and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

    (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the TVA Board may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1302.9.

    § 1302.10   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 1302.10

    (a)  A member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner who holds the hearing shall either make an initial decision or certify the entire record, including the Board member's or examiner's recommended findings and proposed decision, to the TVA Board for a final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner, the recipient may file exceptions to the initial decision, together with a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions and statement shall be filed with the TVA Board within 30 days of the date the notice of initial decision was mailed to the recipient. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that the TVA Board will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the TVA Board shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.

    (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the TVA Board for decision or it reviews the decision of a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the TVA Board conducts the hearing, the recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the Board briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Board shall be given in writing to the recipient and to the complainant, if any.

    (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1302.8(a) a decision shall be made by the TVA Board on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given to the recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

    (d)  Each decision shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the recipient has failed to comply.

    (e)  Any final decision (other than a decision by the TVA Board) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this regulation or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the TVA Board, which may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.

    (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part.

    (g)  (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.

    (2) Any recipient or proposed recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request TVA to restore fully the recipient's eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, TVA shall restore such eligibility.

    (3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a written request for a hearing specifying why it believes TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient will be restored to such eligibility if the recipient proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

    § 1302.12   Effect on other regulations; supervision and coordination.

#### § § 1302.12

    (a)  All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by TVA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin to which this regulation applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance to any recipient of such assistance under such program for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):

    (1) Executive Order 12250 and regulations issued thereunder, or

    (2) Any other regulations or instructions, insofar as they prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this regulation is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.

    (b)  TVA may from time to time assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 1302.9), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by TVA.

    Subpart A—Procedures for Approval of Construction

      § 1304.1   Scope and intent.

#### § § 1304.1

      The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 among other things confers on TVA broad authority related to the unified conservation and development of the Tennessee River Valley and surrounding area and directs that property in TVA's custody be used to promote the Act's purposes. In particular, section 26a of the Act requires that TVA's approval be obtained prior to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any dam, appurtenant works, or other obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations along or in the Tennessee River or any of its tributaries. By way of example only, such obstructions may include boat docks, piers, boathouses, buoys, floats, boat launching ramps, fills, water intakes, devices for discharging effluent, bridges, aerial cables, culverts, pipelines, fish attractors, shoreline stabilization projects, channel excavations, and floating cabins as described in § 1304.101. Any person considering constructing, operating, or maintaining any such obstruction on a stream in the Tennessee River Watershed should carefully review the regulations in this part and the 26a Applicant's Package before doing so. The regulations also apply to certain activities on TVA-owned land alongside TVA reservoirs and to land subject to TVA flowage easements. TVA uses and permits use of the lands and land rights in its custody alongside and subjacent to TVA reservoirs and exercises its land rights to carry out the purposes and policies of the Act. In addition, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321  and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1251  have declared it to be congressional policy that agencies should administer their statutory authorities so as to restore, preserve, and enhance the quality of the environment and should cooperate in the control of pollution. It is the intent of the regulations in this part 1304 to carry out the purposes of the Act and other statutes relating to these purposes, and this part shall be interpreted and applied to that end.

> [68 FR 46936, Aug. 7, 2003, as amended at 83 FR 44472, Aug. 31, 2018]

      § 1304.2   Application.

#### § § 1304.2

      (a) If the facility is to be built on TVA land, the applicant must, in addition to the other requirements of this part, own the fee interest in or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest of sufficient tenure to cover the normal useful life of the proposed facility in land immediately adjoining the TVA land. If the facility is to be built on private land, the applicant must own the fee interest in the land or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest in the property where the facility will be located. If the facility is an existing floating cabin, it must meet the requirements of subpart B. TVA recognizes, however, that in some cases private property has been subdivided in a way that left an intervening strip of land between the upland boundary of a TVA flowage easement and the waters of the reservoir, or did not convey to the adjoining landowner the land underlying the waters of the reservoir. In some of these situations, the owner of the intervening strip or underlying land cannot be identified or does not object to construction of water-use facilities by the adjacent landowner. In these situations, TVA may exercise its discretion to permit the facility, provided there is no objection from the fee owner of the intervening strip or underlying land. A TVA permit conveys no property interest. The applicant is responsible for locating the proposed facility on qualifying land and ensuring that there is no objection from any owner of such land. TVA may require the applicant to provide appropriate verification of ownership and lack of objection, but TVA is not responsible for resolving ownership questions. In case of a dispute, TVA may require private parties requesting TVA action to grant or revoke a TVA permit to obtain a court order declaring respective ownership and/or land rights. TVA may exercise its discretion to permit a facility on TVA land that is located up or downstream from the land which makes the applicant eligible for consideration to receive a permit.

      (b) Applications shall be addressed to Tennessee Valley Authority, at the appropriate Regional Watershed Office location as listed on the application and on TVA's website. To contact an office, call 1-800-882-5263 or email  Applications are available on TVA's website.

      (c)  Applicants must submit certain required information depending upon whether a proposed facility is a minor or major facility. Examples of the two categories are provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Most residential related facilities are minor facilities. Commercial or community facilities generally are major facilities. TVA shall determine whether a proposed facility is minor or major. An application shall not be complete until payment of the appropriate fee as determined in accordance with 18 CFR part 1310, and disclosed to the applicant in the materials provided with the application package or by such other means of disclosure as TVA shall from time to time adopt. For purposes of the information required to be submitted under this section and the determination of fees, a request for a variance to the size limitations for a residential-related facility (other than a waiver request under § 1304.212 or § 1304.300(a)) shall be regarded as an application for a major facility. In addition to the information required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, TVA may require the applicant to provide such other information as TVA deems necessary for adequate review of a particular application.

      (1)  By way of example only, minor facilities may include: boat docks, piers, rafts, boathouses, fences, steps, gazebos, and floating cabins. One copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions included in the section 26a Applicant's Package. The application shall include:

      (i)  One copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted. Application forms are available on TVA's website. The application shall include a project description which indicates what is to be built, removed, or modified, and the sequence of the work. Applications for floating cabins shall include written evidence that the floating cabin was located or moored on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, and detailed descriptions of mooring method, how electrical service is provided, and how wastewater is managed. An application to relocate a floating cabin to a marina shall include evidence of approval from the accepting marina operator.

      (ii)  The project plan/drawing shall:

      (A) Be prepared electronically or on paper suitable for reproduction (no larger than 11 by 17 inches).

      (B) Identify the kind of structure, purpose/intended use;

      (C) Show principal dimensions, size, and location in relation to shoreline;

      (D) Show the elevation of the structure above the full summer pool; and

      (E) Indicate the river or reservoir name, river mile, locator landmarks, and direction of water flow if known.

      (iii)  The photograph shall be at least 3 by 5 inches in size and show the location of the proposed structure or alteration and the adjacent shoreline area.

      (iv)  The location map shall clearly show the location of the proposed facility and the extent of any site disturbance for the proposed project. An 8  by 11-inch copy of one of the following is ideal: a TVA land map, a subdivision map, or a portion of a United States Geological Survey topographic map. The subdivision name and lot number and the map number or name shall be included, if available.

      (v)  To the fullest extent possible the applicant shall obtain or apply for other required environmental permits and approvals before or at the same time as applying for section 26a approvals. Consultations under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall take place, and permits from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and State agencies for water or air regulation shall be obtained or applied for at the same time as or before application for section 26a approval. The applicant shall provide TVA with copies of any such permits or approvals that are issued.

      (2)  One (1) copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted according to instructions included in the section 26a Applicant's Package. By way of example only, major projects and facilities may include: marinas, community docks, barge terminals, utility crossings, bridges, culverts, roads, wastewater discharges, water intakes, dredging, and placement of fill. The application shall include:

      (i)  Application forms are available on TVA's website. The application shall include a narrative project description which indicates what is to be built, removed, or modified, and the sequence of the work.

      (ii)  Adequate project plans or drawings shall accompany the application. They shall:

      (A) Be prepared electronically or on paper suitable for reproduction (no larger than 11 by 17 inches).

      (B) Contain the date; applicant name; stream; river or reservoir name; river mile; locator landmarks; and direction of water flow, if known;

      (C) Identify the kind of structure, purpose/intended use;

      (D) Include a plan and profile view of the structure;

      (E) Show principal dimensions, size, and location in relation to shoreline;

      (F) Show the elevations of the structure above full summer pool if located on a TVA reservoir or above the normal high water elevation if on a free-flowing stream or river; and

      (G) Show the north arrow.

      (iii)  The location map must clearly indicate the exact location and extent of site disturbance for the proposed project. An 8 - by 11-inch copy of the appropriate portion of a United States Geological Survey topographic map is recommended. The map number or name shall be included. In addition, recent photos of the location are helpful for TVA's review and may be included.

      (iv)  The location of any material laydown or assembly areas, staging areas, equipment storage areas, new access roads, and road/access closure required by the project or needed for construction; the location of borrow or spoil areas on or off TVA land; the extent of soil and vegetative disturbance; and information on any special reservoir operations needed for the project, such as drawdown or water discharge restrictions.

      (v)  Some projects, particularly larger ones, may require a separate site plan which details existing and proposed changes to surface topography and elevations (cut and fill, clearing, etc.), location of all proposed facilities, and erosion control plans.

      (vi)  To the fullest extent possible the applicant shall obtain or apply for other required environmental permits and approvals before or at the same time as applying for section 26a approvals. Consultations under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall take place, and permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and State agencies for water or air regulation shall be obtained or applied for at the same time as or before application for section 26a approval. The applicant shall provide TVA with copies of any such permits or approvals that are issued.

      (d) Discharges into navigable waters of the United States. If construction, maintenance, or operation of the proposed structure or any part thereof, or the conduct of the activity in connection with which approval is sought may result in any discharge into navigable waters of the United States, applicant shall also submit with the application, in addition to the material required by paragraph (c) of this section, a copy of the request for certification from the state in which such discharge would originate, or if appropriate, from the interstate water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over the navigable waters at the point where the discharge would originate, or from the Environmental Protection Agency, that such state or interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that the applicant's proposed activity will be conducted in a manner that will comply with applicable water quality standards. The applicant shall further submit such supplemental and additional information as TVA may deem necessary for the review of the application, including, without limitation, information concerning the amounts, chemical makeup, temperature differentials, type and quantity of suspended solids, and proposed treatment plans for any proposed discharges. No section 26a permit will be granted until required certification has been obtained or has been waived. If a certifying agency has not acted within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, of an applicant's request for certification from the respective agency and certification is waived, TVA will proceed with processing of the section 26a permit application.

#### § § 1304.11

      As regards structures on the Little Tennessee River, applications are deemed by TVA to be formally submitted within the meaning of section 26a of the Act, on that date upon which applicant has complied in good faith with all applicable provisions of § 1304.2.

    Subpart B—Regulation of Floating Cabins

      § 1304.100   Scope and intent.

#### § § 1304.100

      This subpart prescribes requirements for floating cabins on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins as applied to this subpart include existing nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA and other existing structures, whose design and use is primarily for human habitation or occupation and not for navigation or transportation on the water. Floating cabins that were not located or moored on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed new floating cabins. New floating cabins are prohibited and subject to the removal provisions of this part and Section 9b of the TVA Act. No new floating cabins shall be moored, anchored, or installed on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins that were located or moored in the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed existing floating cabins. Existing floating cabins may remain moored on the Tennessee River System provided they remain in compliance with the rules in this part and obtain a permit from TVA issued after October 12, 2021. All permits for nonnavigable houseboats or floating cabins that were not located on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, are terminated. Unless otherwise noted, the term floating cabin refers to the primary structure on the monolithic frame as well as all attached structures.

> [86 FR 50633, Sept. 10, 2021]

      § 1304.101   Floating cabins.

#### § § 1304.101

      (a)(1) Floating cabins include nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA as of December 16, 2016, and other floating structures moored on the Tennessee River System as of this date and determined by TVA in its sole discretion to be designed and used primarily for human habitation or occupation and not designed and used primarily for navigation or transportation on the water as of December 16, 2016. If, at any time, the floating cabin is modified such that it no longer meets the criteria to be deemed a floating cabin, the approval for that existing floating cabin will be terminated. TVA's judgment will be guided by, but not limited to, the following factors:

      (i) Whether the structure is usually kept at a fixed mooring point;

      (ii) Whether the structure is actually used on a regular basis for transportation or navigation;

      (iii) Whether the structure has a permanent or continuous connection to the shore for electrical, plumbing, water, or other utility service;

      (iv) Whether the structure has the performance characteristics of a vessel typically used for navigation or transportation on water;

      (v) Whether the structure can be readily removed from the water;

      (vi) Whether the structure is used for intermittent or extended human-habitation or occupancy;

      (vii) Whether the structure clearly has a means of propulsion, and appropriate power/size ratio;

      (viii) Whether the structure is safe to navigate or use for transportation purposes.

      (2) That a structure could occasionally move from place to place, or that it qualifies under another federal or state regulatory program as a vessel or boat, are factors that TVA also will consider but would not be determinative. Floating cabins are not recreational vessels to which § 1304.409 applies.

      (b) Owners of floating cabins are required to register the floating cabin with TVA by January 10, 2022. Floating cabin owners shall include the following information with their registration: Clear and current photographs of the structure; a drawing or drawings showing in reasonable detail the size and shape of the floating cabin (length, width, and height) and attached structures, such as decks or slips (length, width, and height); and a completed and signed TVA registration form. The completed TVA registration form shall include the mailing and contact information of the owner(s); the TVA permit or TVA-issued numbers (when applicable); the mooring location of the floating cabin; how the floating cabin is moored; how electrical service is provided; how wastewater and sewage are managed; and an owner's signature.

      (c) All floating cabins shall comply with the rules contained in this part and make application for a section 26a permit by October 1, 2024.

      (d) Existing floating cabins may remain on the Tennessee River System provided they stay in compliance with the rules contained in this part and pay any necessary and reasonable fees levied by TVA to ensure compliance with TVA's regulations, in accordance with section 9b of the TVA Act.

      (e) Existing floating cabins must be moored at one of the following locations:

      (1) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin is the owner or lessee (or the licensee of such owner or lessee) of the proposed mooring location provided the floating cabin was moored at such location as of December 16, 2016;

      (2) At locations described by § 1304.201(a)(1), (2), and (3) provided the floating cabin was moored at such location as of December 16, 2016;

      (3) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin obtained written approval from TVA pursuant to subpart A of this part authorizing mooring at such location as of December 16, 2016; or

      (4) Within the designated and approved harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. As provided in § 1304.404, TVA may adjust harbor limits and require relocation of an existing floating cabin within the harbor limits.

      (f) Applications for mooring of a floating cabin outside of designated harbor limits will be disapproved if TVA determines that the proposed mooring location would be contrary to the intent of this subpart.

      (g) A floating cabin moored at a location approved pursuant to this subpart shall not be relocated and moored at a different location without a permit from TVA, except for movement to a new location within the designated harbor limits of the same commercial marina. Existing floating cabins may only relocate to the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404 on the same reservoir where the floating cabin was moored as of December 16, 2016. Relocation of a floating cabin to another TVA reservoir is prohibited.

      (h)(1) Existing floating cabins shall be maintained in a good state of repair and may be maintained without additional approval from TVA. By way of example, these activities may include painting, changing the internal walls within the existing enclosed space, replacing the shingles, siding, electrical wiring, or plumbing, or adding new flotation in compliance with § 1304.400. Repair and maintenance activities shall not modify the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the floating cabin, any external walls, or the enclosed or open space.

      (2) Any alterations to the dimensions or approved plans for an existing floating cabin shall be deemed a structural modification and shall require prior written approval from TVA. All expansions in length, width, or height are prohibited, except under the following circumstances if approved in writing in advance by TVA:

      (i) TVA may allow alterations necessary to comply with health, safety, and environmental standards;

      (ii) TVA may allow changes in roof pitch or allow open portions of the monolithic frame to be covered, but no part of the floating cabin may exceed a total height of 14 feet above the lowest floor level; or

      (iii) TVA may allow enclosure of existing open space on the monolithic frame of the existing floating cabin if the enclosure will not result in expansion to the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the monolithic frame, subject to § 1304.101(i). At least 24 contiguous square feet of open space with a minimum width of four feet shall be maintained on the monolithic frame for unrestricted boarding.

      (3) Owners must submit an application to TVA 60 days in advance of proposed rebuilding of a floating cabin or a significant portion of a floating cabin. The owner shall not begin construction until prior written acknowledgment from TVA is received. Plans for removal of the existing floating cabin or portions to be rebuilt shall be acknowledged in writing by TVA before removal occurs, and the removal shall be at the owner's expense before construction of the rebuild may begin. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator to rebuild within the marina. TVA may require a new permit for the proposed rebuilding. Construction of the rebuilt floating cabin must be completed within 18 months. The rebuilt floating cabin shall match the exact configuration and dimensions (length, width, and height) of both the total floating cabin and the enclosed and open space as approved by TVA; attached structures are subject to § 1304.101(i).

      (4) TVA may allow the exchange of multiple existing floating cabins removed from the Tennessee River System for a single combined floating cabin under the following conditions:

      (i) Prior written approval from TVA shall be obtained before taking any actions. Evidence shall be provided to TVA that all existing floating cabins to be exchanged were located on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016.

      (ii) Plans for removal of the existing floating cabin(s) shall be approved in writing by TVA before removal occurs, and the floating cabin(s) shall be removed at the owner's expense before construction of the new combined floating cabin may begin. Approvals of the existing floating cabins to be exchanged will be terminated. Construction on the new combined floating cabin must be completed within 18 months.

      (iii) The combined floating cabin shall be moored within the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator to locate within the marina. The combined floating cabin must be located on the same reservoir as any of the existing floating cabins to be exchanged.

      (iv) The maximum total size of the monolithic frame of the combined floating cabin is 1,000 square feet or the sum of the square footage of the monolithic frames of the existing exchanged floating cabins, whichever is less. At least 24 contiguous square feet with a minimum width of four feet must remain open to allow for unrestricted boarding of the combined floating cabin. Any square footage of the existing exchanged floating cabins that exceeds the maximum allowable total size of the combined floating cabin is not transferrable to other projects or owners.

      (v) The maximum height of any part of the combined floating cabin is 14 feet above the lowest floor level.

      (vi) Floating attached structures, such as decks or platforms, are subject to § 1304.101(i).

      (i) With written approval from TVA, floating cabins may be accompanied by floating attached structures subject to the following:

      (1) A single floating cabin may have multiple floating attached structures. The footprint of each attached structure will be measured as a rectangular or square area. The total footprint of all attached structures for a single floating cabin cannot exceed 400 square feet or the total footprint of the existing attached structures that were part of the floating cabin as of December 16, 2016, whichever is greater.

      (2) The footprint of the attached structures shall not be incorporated into the footprint of the monolithic frame of the floating cabin.

      (3) Attached structures shall not exceed 14 feet in height from the lowest floor level, shall not be enclosed, and shall comply with § 1304.204(p).

      (4) All attached structures must be permitted to the floating cabin owner. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator for the attached structures.

      (5) Existing attached structures that were part of the floating cabin as of December 16, 2016, may remain with written approval from TVA. Any requests to rebuild or reconfigure attached structures must comply with § 1304.101(i)(1) through (4). Attached structures associated with a request for a structural modification as described in § 1304.101(h)(2)(iii) or a combined floating cabin as described in § 1304.101(h)(4) shall not exceed a total footprint of 400 square feet.

      (j) Any floating cabin not in compliance with this part is subject to the applicable removal provisions of § 1304.406 and section 9b of the TVA Act.

    Subpart C—TVA-Owned Residential Access Shoreland

      § 1304.200   Scope and intent.

#### § § 1304.200

      This subpart C applies to residential water-use facilities, specifically the construction of docks, piers, boathouses (fixed and floating), retaining walls, and other structures and alterations, including channel excavation and vegetation management, on or along TVA-owned residential access shoreland. TVA manages the TVA-owned residential access shoreland to conserve, protect, and enhance shoreland resources, while providing reasonable access to the water of the reservoir by qualifying adjacent residents.

      § 1304.201   Applicability.

#### § § 1304.201

      This subpart addresses residential-related (all private, noncommercial uses) construction activities along and across shoreland property owned by the United States and under the custody and control of TVA. Individual residential landowners wishing to construct facilities, clear vegetation and/or maintain an access corridor on adjacent TVA-owned lands are required to apply for and obtain a permit from TVA before conducting any such activities.

      (a) This subpart applies to the following TVA-reservoir shoreland classifications:

      (1) TVA-owned shorelands over which the adjacent residential landowner holds rights of ingress and egress to the water (except where a particular activity is specifically excluded by an applicable real estate document), including, at TVA's discretion, cases where the applicant owns access rights across adjoining private property that borders on and benefits from rights of ingress and egress across TVA-owned shoreland.

      (2) TVA-owned shorelands designated in current TVA Reservoir Land Management Plans as open for consideration of residential development; and

      (3) On reservoirs not having a current approved TVA Reservoir Land Management Plan at the time of application, TVA-owned shorelands designated in TVA's property forecast system as “reservoir operations property,” identified in a subdivision plat recorded prior to September 24, 1992, and containing at least one water-use facility developed prior to September 24, 1992.

      (b) Construction of structures, access corridors, and vegetation management activities by owners of adjacent upland residential property shall not be allowed on any TVA-owned lands other than those described in one or more of the classifications identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) Flowage easement shoreland. Except as otherwise specifically provided in subpart D of this part, this subpart C does not apply to shoreland where TVA's property interest is ownership of a flowage easement. The terms of the particular flowage easement and subparts A, B, D, and E of this part govern the use of such property.

      § 1304.202   General sediment and erosion control provisions.

#### § § 1304.202

      (a) During construction activities, TVA shall require that appropriate erosion and sediment control measures be utilized to prevent pollution of the waters of the reservoir.

      (b) All material which accumulates behind sediment control structures must be removed from TVA land and placed at an upland site above the 100-year floodplain elevation or the Flood Risk Profile Elevation (whichever is applicable).

      (c) Disturbed sites must be promptly stabilized with seeding, vegetative planting, erosion control netting, and/or mulch material.

      § 1304.203   Vegetation management.

#### § § 1304.203

      No vegetation management shall be approved on TVA-owned Residential Access Shoreland until a Vegetation Management Plan meeting the vegetation management standards contained in this section is submitted to and approved by TVA.

      (a) Except for the mowing of lawns established and existing before November 1, 1999, all vegetation management activities on TVA-owned property subject to this subpart (including all such activities described in paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section as “allowed” and all activities undertaken in connection with a section 26a permit obtained before September 8, 2003) require TVA's advance written permission. Special site circumstances such as the presence of wetlands may result in a requirement for mitigative measures or alternative vegetation management approaches.

      (b) Vegetation may be cleared to create and maintain an access corridor up to but not exceeding 20 feet wide. The corridor will extend from the common boundary between TVA and the adjacent landowner to the water-use facility.

      (c) The access corridor will be located to minimize removal of trees or other vegetation on the TVA land.

      (d) Grass may be planted and mowed within the access corridor, and stone, brick, concrete, mulch, or wooden paths, walkways and/or steps are allowed. Pruning of side limbs that extend into the access corridor from trees located outside the access corridor is allowed.

      (e) A 50-foot-deep shoreline management zone (SMZ) shall be designated by TVA on TVA property; provided, however, that where TVA ownership is insufficient to establish a 50-foot-deep SMZ, the SMZ shall consist only of all of the TVA land at the location (private land shall not be included within the SMZ). Within the SMZ, no trees may be cut or vegetation removed, except that which is preapproved by TVA within the access corridor.

      (f) Within the 50-foot SMZ and elsewhere on TVA land as defined in § 1304.201, clearing of specified understory plants (poison ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, kudzu, and other exotic plants on a list provided by TVA) is allowed.

      (g) On TVA land situated above the SMZ, selective thinning of trees or other vegetation under three inches in diameter at the ground level is allowed.

      (h) Removal of trees outside of the access corridor but within the SMZ may be approved to make the site suitable for approved shoreline erosion control projects.

      (i) Vegetation removed for erosion control projects must be replaced with native species of vegetation.

      (j) The forest floor must be left undisturbed, except as specified in this section. Mowing is allowed only within the access corridor.

      (k) Planting of trees, shrubs, wildflowers, native grasses, and ground covers within the SMZ is allowed to create, improve, or enhance the vegetative cover, provided native plants are used.

      (l) Fertilizers and herbicides shall not be applied within the SMZ or elsewhere on TVA land, except as specifically approved in the Vegetative Management Plan.

      (m) Restricted use herbicides and pesticides shall not be applied on TVA-owned shoreland except by a State certified applicator. All herbicides and pesticides shall be applied in accordance with label requirements.

      § 1304.204   Docks, piers, and boathouses.

#### § § 1304.204

      Applicants are responsible for submitting plans for proposed docks, piers, and boathouses that conform to the size standards specified in this section. Where and if site constraints at the proposed construction location preclude a structure of the maximum size, TVA shall determine the size of facility that may be approved. Applicants are required to submit accurate drawings with dimensions of all proposed facilities.

      (a) Docks, piers, boathouses, and all other residential water-use facilities shall not exceed a total footprint area of 1,000 square feet, unless the proposed water-use facility will be located in an area of preexisting development. For the purpose of this regulation, “preexisting development” means either: The water-use facility will be located in a subdivision recorded before November 1, 1999, and TVA permitted at least one water-use facility in the subdivision prior to November 1, 1999; or if there is no subdivision, where the water-use facility will be located within a quarter-mile radius of another water-use facility that TVA permitted prior to November 1, 1999. Water-use facilities located in an area of preexisting development shall not exceed a total footprint area of 1,800 square feet.

      (b) Docks, boatslips, piers, and fixed or floating boathouses are allowable. These and other water-use facilities associated with a lot must be sited within a 1,000- or 1,800-square-foot rectangular or square area as required by § 1304.204(a) at the lakeward end of the access walkway that extends from the shore to the structure. Access walkways to the water-use structure are not included in calculating the 1,000- or 1,800-square foot area.

      (c) Docks and walkway(s) shall not extend more than 150 feet from the shoreline, or more than one-third the distance to the opposite shoreline, whichever is less.

      (d) All fixed piers and docks on Pickwick, Wilson, Wheeler, Guntersville, and Nickajack Reservoirs shall have deck elevations at least 18 inches above full summer pool level; facilities on all other reservoirs, shall be a minimum of 24 inches above full summer pool.

      (e) All docks, piers, and other water-use facilities must be attached to the shore with a single walkway which must connect from land to the structure by the most direct route and must adjoin the access corridor.

      (f) Docks, piers, and boathouses may be fixed or floating or a combination of the two types.

      (g) Roofs are allowed on boatslips, except on Kentucky Reservoir where roofs are not allowed on fixed structures due to extreme water level fluctuations. Roofs over docks or piers to provide shade are allowed on all reservoirs.

      (h) Docks proposed in subdivisions recorded after November 1, 1999, must be placed at least 50 feet from the neighbors' docks. When this density requirement cannot be met, TVA may require group or community facilities.

      (i) Where the applicant owns or controls less than 50 feet of property adjoining TVA shoreland, the overall width of the facilities permitted along the shore shall be limited to ensure sufficient space to accommodate other property owners.

      (j) Covered boatslips may be open or enclosed with siding.

      (k) Access walkways constructed over water and internal walkways inside of boathouses shall not exceed six feet in width.

      (l) Enclosed space shall be used solely for storage of water-use equipment. The outside dimensions of any completely enclosed storage space shall not exceed 32 square feet and must be located on an approved dock, pier, or boathouse.

      (m) Docks, piers, and boathouses shall not contain living space or sleeping areas. Floor space shall not be considered enclosed if three of the four walls are constructed of wire or screen mesh from floor to ceiling, and the wire or screen mesh leaves the interior of the structure open to the weather.

      (n) Except for floating cabins approved in accordance with subpart B of this part, toilets and sinks are not permitted on water-use facilities.

      (o) Covered docks, boatslips, and boathouses shall not exceed one story in height.

      (p) Second stories on covered docks, piers, boatslips, or boathouses may be constructed as open decks with railing, but shall not be covered by a roof or enclosed with siding or screening.

      (q) In congested areas or in other circumstances deemed appropriate by TVA, TVA may require an applicant's dock, pier, or boathouse to be located on an area of TVA shoreline not directly fronting the applicant's property.

      (d) Electrical appliances such as stoves, refrigerators, freezers, and microwave ovens are not permitted on docks, piers, or boathouses.

      (e) Mooring buoys/posts may be permitted provided the following requirements are met.

      (1) Posts and buoys shall be placed in such a manner that in TVA's judgment they would not create a navigation hazard.

      (2) Mooring posts must be a minimum 48 inches in height above the full summer pool elevation of the reservoir or higher as required by TVA.

      (3) Buoys must conform to the Uniform State Waterway Marking system.

      (f) Structures shall not be wider than the width of the lot.

      (g) In congested areas, TVA may establish special permit conditions requiring dry-docking of floating structures when a reservoir reaches a specific drawdown elevation to prevent these structures from interfering with navigation traffic, recreational boating access, or adjacent structures during winter drawdown.

      (h) Closed loop heat exchanges for residential heat pump application may be approved provided they are installed five feet below minimum winter water elevation and they utilize propylene glycol or water. All land-based pipes must be buried within the access corridor.

      § 1304.206   Requirements for community docks, piers, boathouses, or other water-use facilities.

#### § § 1304.206

      (a) Community facilities where individual facilities are not allowed:

      (1) TVA may limit water-use facilities to community facilities where physical or environmental constraints preclude approval of individual docks, piers, or boathouses.

      (2) When individual water-use facilities are not allowed, no more than one slip for each qualified applicant will be approved for any community facility. TVA shall determine the location of the facility and the named permittees, taking into consideration the preferences of the qualified applicants and such other factors as TVA determines to be appropriate.

      (3) In narrow coves or other situations where shoreline frontage is limited, shoreline development may be limited to one landing dock for temporary moorage of boats not to exceed the 1000-square-foot footprint requirement, and/or a boat launching ramp, if the site, in TVA's judgment, will accommodate such development.

      (b) Private and community facilities at jointly-owned community outlots:

      (1) Applications for private or community facilities to be constructed at a jointly-owned community outlot must be submitted either with 100 percent concurrence of all co-owners of such lot, or with concurrence of the authorized representatives of a State-chartered homeowners association with the authority to manage the common lot on behalf of all persons having an interest in such lot. If the community facility will serve five or more other lots, the application must be submitted by the authorized representatives of such an association. TVA considers an association to have the necessary authority to manage the common lot if all co-owners are eligible for membership in the association and a majority are members. TVA may request the association to provide satisfactory evidence of its authority.

      (2) Size and number of slips at community water-use facilities lots shall be determined by TVA with consideration of the following:

      (i) Size of community outlot;

      (ii) Parking accommodations on the community outlot;

      (iii) Length of shoreline frontage associated with the community outlot;

      (iv) Number of property owners having the right to use the community outlot;

      (5) Site preparation must be limited to the work necessary to obtain adequate slope and stability of the riprap material.

      (c) Use of retaining walls for shoreline stabilization.

      (1) Retaining walls shall be allowed only where the erosion process is severe and TVA determines that a retaining wall is the most effective erosion control option or where the proposed wall would connect to an existing TVA-approved wall on the lot or to an adjacent owner's TVA-approved wall.

      (2) The retaining wall must be constructed of stone, concrete blocks, poured concrete, gabions, or other materials acceptable to TVA. Railroad ties, rubber tires, broken concrete (unless determined by TVA to be of adequate size and integrity), brick, creosote timbers, and asphalt are not allowed.

      (3) Reclamation of land that has been lost to erosion is not allowed.

      (4) The base of the retaining wall shall not be located more than an average of two horizontal feet lakeward of the existing full summer pool water. Riprap shall be placed at least two feet in depth along the footer of the retaining wall to deflect wave action and reduce undercutting that could eventually damage the retaining wall.

      § 1304.404   Commercial marina harbor limits.

#### § § 1304.404

      The landward limits of commercial marina harbor areas are determined by the extent of land rights held by the dock operator. The lakeward limits of harbors at commercial marinas will be designated by TVA on the basis of the size and extent of facilities at the dock, navigation and flood control requirements, optimum use of lands and land rights owned by the United States, carrying capacity of the reservoir area in the vicinity of the marina, and on the basis of the environmental effects associated with the use of the harbor. Mooring buoys, slips, breakwaters, and permanent anchoring are prohibited beyond the lakeward extent of harbor limits. TVA may, at its discretion, reconfigure harbor limits based on changes in circumstances, including but not limited to, changes in the ownership of the land base supporting the marina.

      § 1304.405   Fuel storage tanks and handling facilities.

#### § § 1304.405

      Fuel storage tanks and handling facilities are generally either underground (UST) or aboveground (AST) storage tank systems. An UST is any one or combination of tanks or tank systems defined in applicable Federal or State regulations as an UST. Typically (unless otherwise provided by applicable Federal or State rules), an UST is used to contain a regulated substance (such as a petroleum product) and has 10 percent or more of its total volume beneath the surface of the ground. The total volume includes any piping used in the system. An UST may be a buried tank, or an aboveground tank with buried piping if the piping holds 10 percent or more of the total system volume including the tank. For purposes of this part, an aboveground storage tank (AST) is any storage tank whose total volume (piping and tank) is less than 10 percent underground or any storage tank defined by applicable law or regulation as an AST.

      (a) TVA requires the following to be included in all applications submitted after September 8, 2003 to install an UST or any part of an UST system below the 500-year flood elevation on a TVA reservoir, or regulated tailwater:

      (1) A copy of the State approval for the UST along with a copy of the application sent to the State and any plans or drawings that were submitted for the State's review;

      (2) Evidence of secondary containment for all piping or other systems associated with the UST;

      (3) Evidence of secondary containment to contain leaks from gas pump(s);

      (4) Calculations certified by a licensed, professional engineer in the relevant State showing how the tank will be anchored so that it does not float during flooding; and

      (5) Evidence, where applicable, that the applicant has complied with all spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) requirements.

      (b) The applicant must accept and sign a document stating that the applicant shall at all times be the owner of the UST system, that TVA shall have the right (but no duty) to prevent or remedy pollution or violations of law, including removal of the UST system, with costs charged to the applicant, that the applicant shall at all times maintain and operate the UST system in full compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local UST regulations, and that the applicant shall maintain eligibility in any applicable State trust fund.

      (c) An application to install an AST or any part of an AST system below the 500-year elevation on a TVA reservoir or a regulated tailwater is subject to all of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section except that paragraph (a)(1) shall not apply in States that do not require application or approval for installation of an AST. Eligibility must be maintained for any applicable AST trust fund, and the system must be maintained and operated in accordance with any applicable AST regulations. The applicant must notify and obtain any required documents or permission from the State fire marshal's office prior to installation of the AST. The applicant must also follow the National Fire Protection Association Codes 30 and 30A for installation and maintenance of flammable and combustible liquids storage tanks at marine service stations.

      (d)  TVA will not approve the installation, operation, or maintenance of fuel handling facilities on any private, non-commercial dock or pier.

      (e)  TVA will not approve the installation of any floating fuel handling facility or fuel storage tank.

      (f)  Applicants for a fuel handling facility to be located in whole or in part on TVA land shall be required to provide TVA, in a form and amount acceptable to TVA, a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, pollution liability insurance, or other evidence of financial responsibility in the event of a release.

      § 1304.406   Removal of unauthorized, unsafe, and derelict structures or facilities.

#### § § 1304.406

      If, at any time, any dock, wharf, boathouse (fixed or floating), floating cabin, outfall, aerial cable or other fixed or floating structure or facility (including any navigable boat or vessel that has become deteriorated or is a potential navigation hazard or impediment to flood control) is anchored, installed, constructed or moored in a manner inconsistent with this part, or is not constructed in accordance with TVA's approval or plans approved by TVA, or is not maintained or operated so as to remain in accordance with this part and such approval or plans, or is not kept in a good state of repair and in good, safe and substantial condition, and the owner or operator thereof fails to repair or remove such structure (or operate or maintain it in accordance with such approval or plans) within ninety (90) days after written notice from TVA to do so, TVA may cancel any license, permit, or approval and remove such structure, and/or cause it to be removed, from the Tennessee River system and/or lands in the custody and control of TVA. Such written notice may be given by mailing a copy thereof to the owner's address as listed on the license, permit, or approval or by posting a copy on the structure or facility. TVA may remove or cause to be removed any such structure or facility anchored, installed, constructed, or moored without such license, permit, or approval, whether such license or approval has once been obtained and subsequently canceled, or whether it has never been obtained. TVA's removal costs shall be charged to the owner of the structure, and payment of such costs shall be a condition of approval for any future facility proposed to serve the tract of land at issue or any tract derived therefrom whether or not the current owner caused such charges to be incurred. In addition, any applicant with an outstanding removal charge payable to TVA shall, until such time as the charge be paid in full, be ineligible to receive a permit or approval from TVA for any facility located anywhere along or in the Tennessee River or its tributaries. TVA shall not be responsible for the loss of property associated with the removal of any such structure or facility including, without limitation, the loss of any navigable boat or vessel moored at such a facility. Any costs voluntarily incurred by TVA to protect and store such property shall be removal costs within the meaning of this section, and TVA may sell such property and apply the proceeds toward any and all of its removal costs. Small businesses seeking expedited consideration of the economic impact of actions under this section may contact TVA's Supplier and Diverse Business Relations staff, TVA Procurement, 1101 Market Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402-2801.

      § 1304.407   Development within flood control storage zones of TVA reservoirs.

#### § § 1304.407

      (a) Activities involving development within the flood control storage zone on TVA reservoirs will be reviewed to determine if the proposed activity qualifies as a repetitive action. Under TVA's implementation of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, repetitive actions are projects within a class of actions TVA has determined to be approvable without further review and documentation related to flood control storage, provided the loss of flood control storage caused by the project does not exceed one acre-foot. A partial list of repetitive actions includes:

      (1) Private and public water-use facilities;

      (2) Commercial recreation boat dock and water-use facilities;

      (3) Water intake structures;

      (4) Outfalls;

      (5) Mooring and loading facilities for barge terminals;

      (6) Minor grading and fills; and

      (7) Bridges and culverts for pedestrian, highway, and railroad crossings.

      (b) Projects resulting in flood storage loss in excess of one acre-foot will not be considered repetitive actions.

      (c) For projects not qualifying as repetitive actions, the applicant shall be required, as appropriate, to evaluate alternatives to the placement of fill or the construction of a project within the flood control storage zone that would result in lost flood control storage. The alternative evaluation would either identify a better option or support and document that there is no reasonable alternative to the loss of flood control storage. If this determination can be made, the applicant must then demonstrate how the loss of flood control storage will be minimized.

      (1) In addition, documentation shall be provided regarding:

      (i) The amount of anticipated flood control storage loss;

      (ii) The cost of compensation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from the flood control storage zone, haul it to an upland site and dispose of it);

      (iii) The cost of mitigation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from another site within the flood control storage zone, haul it to the project site and use as the fill material);

      (iv) The cost of the project; and

      (v) The nature and significance of any economic and/or natural resource benefits that would be realized as a result of the project.

      (2) TVA may, in its discretion, decline to permit any project that would result in the loss of flood control storage.

      (d) Recreational vehicles parked or placed within flood control storage zones of TVA reservoirs shall be deemed an obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations within the meaning of section 26a of the Act unless they:

      (1) Remain truly mobile and ready for highway use. The unit must be on its wheels or a jacking system and be attached to its site by only quick disconnect type utilities;

      (2) Have no permanently attached additions, connections, foundations, porches, or similar structures; and

      (3) Have an electrical cutoff switch that is located above the flood control zone and fully accessible during flood events.

      § 1304.408   Variances.

#### § § 1304.408

      The Vice President or the designee thereof is authorized, following consideration whether a proposed structure or other regulated activity would adversely impact navigation, flood control, public lands or reservations, power generation, the environment, or sensitive environmental resources, or would be incompatible with surrounding uses or inconsistent with an approved TVA reservoir land management plan, to approve a structure or activity that varies from the requirements of this part in minor aspects.

      § 1304.409   Indefinite or temporary moorage of recreational vessels.

#### § § 1304.409

      (a) Recreational vessels' moorage at unpermitted locations along the water's edge of any TVA reservoir may not exceed 14 consecutive days at any one place or at any place within one mile thereof.

      (b) Recreational vessels may not establish temporary moorage within the limits of primary or secondary navigation channels.

      (c) Moorage lines of recreational vessels may not be placed in such a way as to block or hinder boating access to any part of the reservoir.

      (d) Permanent or extended moorage of a recreational vessel along the shoreline of any TVA reservoir without approval under section 26a of the TVA Act is prohibited.

      § 1304.410   Navigation restrictions.

      (a) Except for the placement of riprap along the shoreline, structures, land based or water use, shall not be located within the limits of safety harbors and landings established for commercial navigation.

      (b) Structures shall not be located in such a way as to block the visibility of navigation aids. Examples of navigation aids are lights, dayboards, and directional signs.

      (c) The establishment of “no-wake” zones outside approved harbor limits is prohibited at marinas or community dock facilities that are adjacent to or near a commercial navigation channel. In such circumstances, facility owners may, upon approval from TVA, install a floating breakwater along the harbor limit to reduce wave and wash action.

      § 1304.411   Fish attractor, spawning, and habitat structures.

#### § § 1304.411

      Fish attractors constitute potential obstructions and require TVA approval.

      (a) Fish attractors may be constructed of anchored brush piles, log cribs, and/or spawning benches, stake beds, vegetation, or rock piles, provided they meet “TVA Guidelines for Fish Attractor Placement in TVA Reservoirs” (TVA 1997).

      (b) When established in connection with an approved dock, fish attractors shall not project more than 30 feet out from any portion of the dock.

      (c) Any floatable materials must be permanently anchored.

    § 1307.6   Accessibility.

#### § § 1307.6

    (a)  No qualified handicapped person shall, because facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity subject to this part.

    (b)  (1) Each program or activity subject to this part shall be operated so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make building alterations or structural changes if other methods are effective in achieving accessibility. Such compliance methods may include (subject to the provisions of §§ 1307.4 and 1307.5), reassigning aid, benefits, or services to accessible locations within a facility; providing assistance to handicapped persons into or through an otherwise inaccessible facility; delivering programs or activities at other alternative sites which are accessible and are operated or available for use by the recipient; or other methods which comply with the intent of this paragraph.

    (2) This paragraph governs the timing of development of transition plans and the completion of necessary building alterations and structural changes to existing facilities, including historic property covered by paragraph (c) of this section. If building alterations or structural changes will be necessary to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the recipient shall develop a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete the alterations or changes in accordance with such standards as TVA may specify in the contract or agreement, and shall have the plan approved by TVA. If the financial assistance from TVA is expected to last for less than three years, the contract or agreement shall specify the date by which the transition plan shall be developed and approved. If the financial assistance from TVA is expected to last for at least three years, the transition plan shall be developed and submitted to TVA within six months from the effective date of the contract or agreement, subject to extension by TVA for an additional six month period, for good cause shown to it. A transition plan shall:

    (i) Be developed with the assistance of interested persons or organizations representing handicapped persons;

    (ii) Be available for public inspection after approval by TVA (or at any earlier time required by state or local law applicable to the recipient);

    (iii) Identify the official responsible for implementation of the approved plan; and

    (iv) Specify the date by which the required alterations or changes shall be completed, which shall be as soon as practicable and in no event later than three years after the effective date that financial assistance is extended by TVA.

    (3) Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

    (c)  If a recipient's program or activity uses an existing facility which is an historic property, the recipient shall endeavor to assure compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section by compliance methods which do not alter the historic character or architectural integrity of the historic property. The recipient must determine that accessibility cannot be accomplished by such alternative methods before considering building alterations as a compliance method. To the maximum extent possible any building alterations determined to be necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy architecturally significant elements or features. A recipient may determine that structural changes are necessary to accomplish accessibility only if the recipient has determined that accessibility cannot feasibly be accomplished by any of the other foregoing methods. To the maximum extent possible, any structural changes determined to be necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy architecturally significant elements or features.

    (d)  (1) New facilities required under a program or activity subject to this part shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

    (2) Effective as of November 4, 1988, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with Sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6 app. A) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.

    (3) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of physically handicapped persons.

    (4) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

    § 1307.7   Assurances required.

#### § § 1307.7

    (a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with this part and compliance with such standards for construction and alteration of facilities as TVA may provide. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or the transferee in the case of a subsequent transfer, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient during the period for which ownership or possession of the property is retained. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreement, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.

    (b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired with TVA financial assistance, or in the case where financial assistance was provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a convenant running with the land assuring compliance with this part and the guidelines contained herein for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the TVA financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with of TVA financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

    § 1307.8   Compliance information.

#### § § 1307.8

    (a)  TVA shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

    (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to TVA timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as TVA may determine to be necessary to enable it to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case which a primary recipient extends financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

    (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by TVA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities, as TVA may require to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and set forth the efforts it has made to obtain the information.

    (d)  Each recipient shall make available to employees, participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program or activity for which the recipient receives financial assistance, and shall make such information available to them in such manner, as TVA finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by section 504 and this part.

    § 1307.9   Conduct of investigations.

#### § § 1307.9

    (a)  TVA shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.

    (b)  Any individual who claims (individually or on behalf of any specific class of individuals) to have been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may, personally or by a representative, file with TVA a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than ninety (90) days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by TVA.

    (c)  TVA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation shall include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.

    (d)  (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, TVA will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If TVA determines that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 1307.10.

    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d) (1) of this section, TVA will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

    (e)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 504 or this part, or because the individual had made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

    § 1307.10   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 1307.10

    (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not to be limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, (2) institution of appropriate proceedings by TVA to enforce the provisions of the agreement of financial assistance or of any deed or instrument relating thereto, and (3) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

    (b)  If any entity requesting financial assistance from TVA declines to furnish the assurance required under § 1307.7, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section; and for such purposes, the term “recipient” includes one who has been denied financial assistance. TVA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that TVA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance was due and payable pursuant to an agreement therefor entered into with TVA prior to the effective date of this part.

    (c)  No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue financial assistance shall become effective until (1) TVA has advised the recipient of the failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, including any act of discrimination on the basis of handicap in violation of this part, and (3) the action has been approved by the TVA Board pursuant to § 1307.12. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue financial assistance shall be limited to the particular recipient as to whom such a finding had been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program or activity, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance had been so found.

    (d)  No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) TVA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least ten (10) days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least ten (10) days additional efforts will be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

    § 1307.11   Hearings.

#### § § 1307.11

    (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1307.10, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected recipient. This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and shall either (1) fix a date not less than twenty (20) days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing and a consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

    (b)  Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the TVA Board or before a “hearing officer” who shall be either a member of the TVA Board or, at the discretion of the Board, a person designated by the Board who shall not be employed in or under the TVA division through or under which the financial assistance has been extended by TVA to the recipient involved in the hearing.

    (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the recipient and TVA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

    (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

    (2) Technical rules of evidence will not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. That officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

    (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal agencies issued under section 504, the TVA Board may, by agreement with such other agency, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1307.12.

    § 1307.12   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 1307.12

    (a)  If the hearing is held before a “hearing officer” as defined in § 1307.11(b), that hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the TVA Board for a final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a hearing officer, the recipient may file with the TVA Board exceptions to the initial decision, which shall include a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice of initial decision. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within forty-five (45) days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that it will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the TVA Board shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.

    (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the TVA Board for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the TVA Board conducts the hearing, the recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the Board briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Board shall be given in writing to the recipient and to the complainant, if any.

    (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived, a decision shall be made by the TVA Board on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given to the recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

    (d)  Each decision shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the recipient has failed to comply.

    (e)  Any final decision (other than a decision by the TVA Board) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or section 504 shall promptly be transmitted to the TVA Board which may approve such decision, vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.

    (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of section 504 and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part.

    (g)  (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial assistance upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions for such eligibility contained in that order, or if the recipient otherwise comes into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance of future full compliance with this part.

    (2) Any recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request that TVA fully restore the recipient's eligibility to receive financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, it shall restore such eligibility.

    (3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying its reasons for believing TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient, upon proving at such a hearing that the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section are satisfied, will be restored to such eligibility. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

    § 1307.13   Effect on other regulations; supervision and coordination.

#### § § 1307.13

    (a)  Nothing in this part shall be deemed to supersede or affect any of the following (including future amendments thereof): (1) Regulations by TVA and other Federal agencies issued with respect to section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or (2) any other regulations or instructions, insofar as they prohibit discrimination on the ground of handicap in any program or activity or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or which prohibit discrimination on any other ground.

    (b)  TVA may from time to time assign to officials of other Federal agencies, with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of section 504 and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 1307.12), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Executive Branch of the government in the application of section 504 and this part to similar programs or activities and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another federal agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this part shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by TVA.

      (2) Include sufficient supporting data to permit the Contracting Officer to decide the claim, or provide appropriate reference to previously submitted data;

      (3) If monetary relief totalling more than $50,000 is involved, include a signed certification by the Contractor that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, and that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes TVA is liable;

      (4) Be signed by the Contractor, or on its behalf if the Contractor is other than an individual.

If the disputes clause in the contract is not an “all disputes” clause ( v.  465 F.2d 1073 (5th Cir. 1972)), a Contractor's election under this section shall cause the provisions of the first two sentences of section 6(a) of the Act to apply to the contract, and such an election shall be irrevocable.

      (b) A Contractor makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section by giving written notice to the Contracting Officer stating that the Contractor elects to proceed with the dispute under the Act. For disputes pending on March 1, 1979, the notice shall be actually received by the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's decision. For disputes initiated thereafter, the notice shall be included in the document first requesting a decision by the Contracting Officer.

      § 1308.6   Fraudulent claims.

#### § § 1308.6

      (a) If a Contractor is unable to support any part of a claim and it is determined that such inability is attributable to the Contractor's misrepresentation of fact or fraud, the Contractor shall be liable to TVA, as set out in section 5 of the Act, for:

      (1) An amount equal to the unsupported part of the claim; plus

      (2) All TVA's costs attributable to reviewing that part of the claim.

      (b) The Contracting Officer shall issue a decision to the Contractor on a submitted claim in conformity with the contract's disputes clause. Specific findings of fact are not required, but may be made. Such findings are not binding in any subsequent proceeding except as provided in § 1308.15. The decision shall:

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) State the reasons for the decision reached;

      (3) Include information about the Contractor's rights of appeal under sections 7 and 10 of the Act (including time limits); and

      (4) Notify the Contractor, as appropriate, of the special procedures available under §§ 1308.35 and 1308.36 at the Contractor's election. A copy of the provisions of this part shall be furnished with the decision.

      § 1308.13   Time limits for decisions.

#### § § 1308.13

      (a) If a submitted claim involves $50,000 or less, the Contracting Officer shall issue the decision within 60 days from actual receipt of the claim. If a submitted claim involves more than $50,000, the Contracting Officer within 60 days from actual receipt shall either issue a decision or notify the Contractor of the date by which a decision shall be rendered, which shall be within a reasonable time.

      § 1308.14   Request for relief by TVA.

#### § § 1308.14

      When TVA believes it is due relief under a contract, the Contracting Officer shall make a request for relief against the Contractor, and shall attempt to resolve the request by agreement. If agreement cannot be reached within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer shall issue a decision which complies with the requirements of § 1308.12(b).

      § 1308.15   Finality of decisions.

#### § § 1308.15

      A decision by a Contracting Officer under the disputes clause of a contract subject to this part is final and conclusive and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or Government agency unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced under this part or section 10(a) (2) and (3) of the Act.

#### § § 1308.16

      If a Contracting Officer denies any part of a Contractor's claim for lack of support, and the Contracting Officer is of the opinion that the Contractor's inability to support that part of the claim is within § 1308.6 and section 5 of the Act, the Contracting Officer's decision shall not state that opinion, but, contemporaneously with the decision, the Contracting Officer shall separately notify TVA's General Counsel of that opinion and the reasons therefor.

      Any failure by Contracting Officer to issue a decision on a submitted claim within the period required or permitted by § 1308.13, will be deemed to be a decision by the Contracting Officer denying the claim and will authorize the commencement of an appeal on the claim under this part, or a suit on the claim as provided in section 10(a)(2) of the Act. If no appeal or suit pursuant to this section has been commenced at the time the Contracting Officer issues a decision, the right to sue or appeal and the time limits therefor shall be determined as otherwise provided in this part and the Act, and this section shall not authorize an appeal or suit from the decision.

      (b) The Board shall consist of an indeterminate number of members, who shall serve on a part-time basis. The members of the Board shall all be attorneys at law duly licensed by any state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia.

      (d) If a member to whom an appeal has been assigned cannot perform in a timely manner the duties of Hearing Officer, because of unavailability or incapacity which would in the Chairman's judgment affect the expeditious and timely resolution of the appeal, or for any other reason deemed sufficient by the Chairman, the Chairman may take any action deemed appropriate to effectuate the disposition of the appeal and the rights of the parties under this part. The kind of action taken, and the manner thereof, shall be within the discretion of the Chairman, and may include, but is not limited to, action on pending motions, discovery, issuance of or ruling on objections to subpoenas, and reassignment of an appeal in whole or in part.

      § 1308.22   Representation.

#### § § 1308.22

      (a) In any appeal to the Board, a Contractor may be represented by an attorney at law duly licensed by any state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. A Contractor not an individual and not wishing to appear by an attorney may be represented by any member, partner, or officer duly authorized to act on Contractor's behalf, or if an individual, may appear personally.

      § 1308.23   Finality of decisions.

#### § § 1308.23

Oral argument will not be heard on such a motion unless otherwise directed. The stay order will normally set a date certain by which the decision of the Contracting Officer will be rendered. Such date shall take into account the factors mentioned in § 1308.13(c), the length of time the matter has already been pending before the Contracting Officer, and the need for prompt and expeditious action on appeals.

> [46 FR 30811, June 11, 1981, as amended at 68 FR 51357, Aug. 26, 2003]

    § 1309.3   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 1309.3

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the Act in all programs or activities of recipients which receive financial assistance from TVA, and to inform the public and the recipients of financial assistance from TVA of the Act's requirements and how it will be enforced.

    (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving financial assistance from TVA.

#### § § 1309.6

    A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 1309.5, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity.

    (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

    (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

    (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

    (d) It is impractical to measure the other characteristic(s) directly on an individual basis.

    § 1309.7   Is the use of reasonable factors other than age an exception to the rules against age discrimination?

#### § § 1309.7

    A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1309.5 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

    § 1309.8   Who has the burden of proving that an action is excepted?

#### § § 1309.8

    The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in §§ 1309.6 and 1309.7 is on the recipient of financial assistance from TVA.

    § 1309.9   How does TVA provide financial assistance in conformity with the Act?

#### § § 1309.9

    (a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with the Act and this part. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or the transferee in the case of a subsequent transfer, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient during the period for which ownership or possession of the property is retained. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreement, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.

    (b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired through a program of TVA financial assistance, or in the case where TVA financial assistance was provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or an interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring compliance with this part and the guidelines contained herein for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the TVA financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with TVA financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the nature of (1) the statute under which the real property is obtained, (2) the recipient, and (3) the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

#### § § 1309.11

    (a)  TVA shall:

    (1) Provide written notice to each recipient of its obligations under the Act. The notice shall include a requirement that where the recipient initially receiving funds makes the funds available to a subrecipient, the recipient must notify the subrecipient of its obligations under the Act. The notice may be made a part of the contract under which financial assistance is provided by TVA.

    (2) Provide technical assistance to recipients, where necessary, to aid them in complying with the Act.

    (3) Make available educational materials setting forth the rights and obligations of beneficiaries and recipients under the Act.

    (b) [Reserved]

#### § § 1309.12

    (a)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to TVA timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times and in such form and containing such information, as TVA may determine to be necessary to enable it to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient passes through financial assistance from TVA to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

    (b)  Each recipient shall permit access by TVA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person, and such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

    (c)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program or activity for which the recipient receives financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner as TVA finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

    § 1309.13   What are the prohibitions against intimidation or retaliation?

#### § § 1309.13

    No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right secured by the Act or this part, or because such individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, mediation, hearing, or other proceeding under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, mediation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising under the Act or this part.

    § 1309.14   How will complaints against recipients be processed?

#### § § 1309.14

    (a)  Any individual who claims (individually or on behalf of any specific class of individuals) that he or she has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part (including § 1309.13) may file a written complaint with TVA. The written complaint must be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by TVA for good cause shown. A complaint shall be signed by the complainant, give the name and mailing address of the complainant and the recipient, identify the TVA financial assistance involved, and state the facts and occurrences (including dates) which led the complainant to believe that an act of prohibited discrimination has occurred. Anonymous complaints will not be accepted or filed under this section, but may be the basis for a compliance review. TVA will reject any complaint which does not fall within the coverage of the Act and this part, and may reject or require supplementation or clarification of any complaint which does not contain sufficient information for further processing as set forth in this paragraph. A complaint shall not be deemed filed until all such information has been provided to TVA.

    (b)  The complaint shall be resolved promptly. To this end, TVA shall proceed with the complaint without undue delay so that the complaint is resolved within 180 calendar days after it is filed with TVA. The recipient and complainant involved in each complaint are required to cooperate in this effort. Failure to cooperate on the part of the complainant may result in cancellation of the complaint, while such failure on the part of the recipient may result in enforcement action as described in § 1309.15.

    (c)  All complaints which fall within the coverage of the Act and this part will be referred to a mediation agency designated by the Secretary.

    (1) The participation of the recipient and the complainant in the mediation process is required, although both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

    (2) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the agreement to writing. The mediator shall send a copy of the settlement to TVA. No further action shall be taken based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient is failing to comply with the agreement.

    (3) Not more than 60 days after the complaint is filed, the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to TVA for initial investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before the end of the 60-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be resolved through mediation.

    (4) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency appointing the mediator.

    (d)  (1) TVA will make a prompt investigation whenever a complaint is unresolved within 60 days after it is filed with TVA or is reopened because of a violation of the mediation agreement. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with the Act and this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with the Act and this part.

    (2) As part of the initial investigation, TVA shall use informal fact finding methods including joint or individual discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, to resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. TVA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

    (3) If TVA cannot resolve the matter within 10 calendar days after the mediator returns the complaint, it shall complete the investigation, attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to TVA, if the investigation indicates a violation, and arrange for enforcement as described in § 1309.15, if necessary.

    § 1309.15   How will TVA enforce compliance with the Act and this part?

#### § § 1309.15

    (a) If a compliance report, self-evaluation, or preaward review indicates a violation or threatened violation of the Act or this part, TVA shall attempt to secure the recipient's voluntary compliance with the Act and this part. If the violation or threatened violation cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with the Act and this part may be effected by the following means:

    (1) Termination of a recipient's financial assistance under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this part. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an appropriate hearing officer.

    (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:

    (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or this part.

    (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency which will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.

    (iii) Commencement by TVA of proceedings to enforce any rights of TVA or obligations of the recipient created by the contract, the Act, or this part.

    (b) Any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be limited to the particular recipient and the particular program or activity (or portion thereof) receiving financial assistance from TVA which is found to be in violation of the Act or this part. No termination shall be based in whole or in part on a finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive financial assistance from TVA.

    (c) No assistance will be terminated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section until:

    (1) TVA has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

    (2) Thirty days have elapsed after TVA has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the termination of assistance to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. A report shall be filed in each case in which TVA has determined that assistance will be terminated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (d) TVA may defer granting new financial assistance to a recipient when termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are initiated.

    (1) New financial assistance includes all assistance administrated by or through TVA for which an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, is required during the deferral period. New financial assistance does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of termination proceedings.

    (2) A deferral may not begin until the recipient has received a notice of opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and TVA. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.

#### § § 1309.16

    When TVA withholds funds from a recipient under this part, TVA may contract to disburse the withheld funds directly to any public or nonprofit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the State. These alternate recipients must demonstrate the ability to comply with this part and to achieve the goals of the Federal financial assistance involved.

    § 1309.17   What is the procedure for hearings and issuance of TVA decisions required by this part?

#### § § 1309.17

    (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1309.15(a)(1), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected recipient. This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under the Act and § 1309.15(a)(1) and a consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

    (b)  Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer who shall be designated by TVA's General Manager, and who shall not be a TVA employee.

    (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the recipient and TVA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

    (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof by TVA's Board of Directors shall be conducted in conformity with this part and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters, as prescribed by the hearing officer. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing.

    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or received for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

    (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, of other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under the Act, the TVA Board may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of the rules of procedure applicable to such hearings by such other departments or agencies. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

    (f)  (1) After the hearing, or after the hearing is waived under paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing officer shall make an initial decision. The recipient may file exceptions to the decision with the TVA Board within 10 days of receipt of the decision. If exceptions are not filed within the specified time, the hearing officer's initial decision becomes the final TVA decision.

    (2) Based on the hearing record, investigation, and any written submission to the hearing officer or the TVA Board, the Board shall render its decision accepting the initial decision, or rejecting it, in whole or part.

    (3) The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulations applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part.

    (g)  (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial assistance from TVA if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.

    (2) Any recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request TVA to restore fully its eligibility to receive financial assistance from TVA. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, it shall restore such eligibility.

    (3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a written request for a hearing, specifying why it believes TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f)(3) of this section shall remain in effect.

    § 1309.18   Under what circumstances must recipients take remedial or affirmative action?

#### § § 1309.18

    (a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action which TVA may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination, if another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, both recipients may be required to take remedial action.

    (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.

    (c) If a recipient operating a program or activity which serves the elderly or children, in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from participation in the program or activity.

    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and TVA has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

    (2) TVA issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

    (b) If either of the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section is satisfied, TVA shall:

    (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and

    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right, under Section 305(e) of the Act, to bring a civil action for injunctive relief that will effect the purposes of the Act; and

    (3) Inform the complainant:

    (i) That a civil action can only be brought in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business;

    (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint;

    (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, TVA, and the recipient;

    (iv) That the notice shall state: the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the action will be brought; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

    (v) That no action shall be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

    § 1312.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1312.1

    (a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources. The regulations in this part also enable TVA's law enforcement agents to issue petty offense citations for violations of any provision of 16 U.S.C. 470ee or 16 U.S.C. 433.

    (b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple uses of the public lands.

    § 1312.2   Authority.

#### § § 1312.2

    (a) The regulations in this part are promulgated pursuant to section 10(a) of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470ii), which requires that the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture and Defense and the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority jointly develop uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Act.

    (b) In addition to the regulations in this part, section 10(b) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 470ii) provides that each Federal land manager shall promulgate such rules and regulations, consistent with the uniform rules and regulations in this part, as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Act.

    (c) Provisions pertaining to the issuance of petty offense citations are based on the duties and powers assigned to TVA's law enforcement agents under 16 U.S.C. 831-831ee.

    § 1312.5   Permit requirements and exceptions.

#### § § 1312.5

    (a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 1312.8(a) of this part.

    (b) Exceptions:

    (1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.

    (2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaelogical resource.

    (3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;

    (4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions until expiration.

    (5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit is issued under this part.

    (c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal land manager's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 1312.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure that provisions of §§ 1312.8 and 1312.9 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of consideration under § 1312.7.

    (d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 1312.5(b)(5), 1312.7, 1312.8(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 1312.9, 1312.10, 1312.12, and 1312.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land manager.

    (e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.

    § 1312.6   Application for permits and information collection.

#### § § 1312.6

    (a) Any person may apply to the appropriate Federal land manager for a permit to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal.

    (b) Each application for a permit shall include:

    (1) The nature and extent of the work proposed, including how and why it is proposed to be conducted, proposed time of performance, locational maps, and proposed outlet for public written dissemination of the results.

    (2) The name and address of the individual(s) proposed to be responsible for conducting the work, institutional affiliation, if any, and evidence of education, training, and experience in accord with the minimal qualifications listed in § 1312.8(a).

Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized official of the institution, or willingness tm assume curatorial responsibility for the collections, if applicable, and/or the records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work.

    (c) The Federal land manager may require additional information, pertinent to land management responsibilities, to be included in the application for permit and shall so inform the applicant.

    (d)  The information collection requirement contained in § 1312.6 of these regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  and assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that archaeological resources and associated records and data will be properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain a benefit.

    § 1312.7   Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.

#### § § 1312.7

    (a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.

    (1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.

    (2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.

    (3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the permit under § 1312.9.

    (4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.

    (b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).

    (2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.

    (3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.

    (4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 1312.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations.

    (i)  (1) The person assessed a civil penalty shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a U.S. District Court as provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.

    (2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal land manager may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the penalty in a U.S. District Court for any district in which the person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts business. Where the Federal land manager is not represented by the Attorney General, a civil action may be initiated directly by the Federal land manager.

    § 1313.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1313.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1313.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1313.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1313.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1313.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of the services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1313.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1313.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 1313.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1313.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1313.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    § 1314.4   Law governing the rights and obligations of TVA and Reserve Banks; law governing the rights of any Person against TVA and Reserve Banks; law governing other interests.

#### § § 1314.4

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part 1314, the Securities Documentation (but not including any choice of law provisions in such documentation), and Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:

    (i) A Book-entry TVA Power Security or Security Entitlement; and

    (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to TVA Power Securities; and

    (2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against TVA and Reserve Banks with respect to:

    (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1314.5(c) is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Security Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1314.5(c), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

    § 1314.5   Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.

#### § § 1314.5

    (a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry TVA Power Security has been credited to a Participant's Security Account.

    (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Reserve Bank, is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Reserve Bank is a party governing the security interest.

    (c) TVA and Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Reserve Bank or in a Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank or a Person may be created and perfected by a Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a security interest in favor of the United States, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.

    (d) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1314.4(b) or (d). The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.

    § 1314.6   Obligations of TVA.

#### § § 1314.6

    (a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1314.5(c), for the purposes of this part 1314, TVA and Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose securities account an interest in a Book-entry TVA Power Security has been credited as the Person exclusively entitled to issue a transfer message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither TVA nor the Reserve Banks are liable to a Person asserting or having an adverse claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry TVA Power Security in a Participant's Security Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry TVA Power Security by a Reserve Bank pursuant to a transfer message that the Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.

    (b) The obligation of TVA to make payments with respect to Book-entry TVA Power Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:

    (1) Interest or other payments on Book-entry TVA Power Securities are either credited by a Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.

    (2) Book-entry TVA Power Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Security Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest, where applicable, to a Funds Account at such bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest as directed by the Participant. No action by the Participant ordinarily is required in connection with the redemption of a Book-entry TVA Power Security.

    Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

      § 1315.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 1315.200

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1315.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

      (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

      (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 1315.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1315.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1315.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 1315.210   Reporting.

#### § § 1315.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 1315.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1315.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1315.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 1315.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 1315.400   Penalties.

#### § § 1315.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $12,000 and not more than $120,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $12,000 and not more than $120,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $12,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $12,000 and $120,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 1315.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 1315.405

      (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart F—Agency Reports

      § 1315.600   Semi-annual compilation.

      (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees.

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 1317.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

      (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

      (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

      § 1317.130   Effect of employment opportunities.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 1317.300 through 1317.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 1317.135, or to the designated agency official.

      A recipient to which §§ 1317.300 through 1317.310 apply shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1317.300 through 1317.310.

      § 1317.310   Recruitment.

#### § § 1317.310

      (b)  A recipient to which §§ 1317.300 through 1317.310 apply shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at educational institutions, schools, or entities that admit as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1317.300 through 1317.310.

      (7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.

      (c)  A recipient educational institution may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other awards established by foreign or domestic wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments and restricted to members of one sex, that are designed to provide opportunities to study abroad, and that are awarded to students who are already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient institution;  that a recipient educational institution that administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, fellowships, or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex provides, or otherwise makes available, reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other sex. Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.

      (d)  (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.

      (2) Such recipient:

      (i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such recipient from taking; and

      (ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such participation if such action occurs.

      § 1317.405   Housing.

#### § § 1317.405

      (A) Proportionate in quantity; and

      (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.

      (ii) A recipient may render such assistance to any agency, organization, or person that provides all or part of such housing to students of only one sex.

      § 1317.410   Comparable facilities.

#### § § 1317.410

      A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.

#### § § 1317.415

      (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.

      (b)(1) With respect to classes and activities in physical education at the elementary school level, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. With respect to physical education classes and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

      (2) This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex.

      (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (4) Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such effect.

      (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.

      (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.

      § 1317.425   Counseling and use of appraisal and counseling materials.

#### § § 1317.425

      (a)  A recipient shall not discriminate against any person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or applicants for admission.

      (b)  A recipient that uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

      (c)  Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.

      (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:

      (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;

      (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

#### § § 1317.440

      Subject to § 1317.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would violate §§ 1317.500 through 1317.550 if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services.

#### § § 1317.445

      (a)  A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.

      (b)  (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.

      (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

      (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

      (4) Subject to § 1317.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

      (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

      § 1317.450   Athletics.

#### § § 1317.450

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

      (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

      (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

      (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

      (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;

      (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

      (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

      (x) Publicity.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

      (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

      (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of these Title IX regulations.

      (b)  The provisions of §§ 1317.500 through 1317.550 apply to:

      (a) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 );

      (b) Other applicable guidelines, regulations and Executive orders implementing NEPA; and

      (c) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508).

      § 1318.20   Policy.

#### § § 1318.20

      It is the policy of TVA that:

      (a) TVA incorporates environmental considerations into its decision-making processes to the fullest extent possible. These procedures ensure that actions are viewed in a manner to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and the environment.

      (b) Commencing at the earliest possible point and continuing through implementation, appropriate and careful consideration of the environmental aspects of proposed actions is built into the decision-making process in order that adverse environmental effects may be avoided or minimized, consistent with the requirements of NEPA.

      (c) Environmental reviews under NEPA will assist decision makers in making better, more knowledgeable decisions that consider those reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that fulfill the purpose and need for the action, concisely present the environmental impacts and other information regarding the proposed action and its alternatives, are consistent with the environmental importance of the action, concentrate on truly significant environmental issues, and are practicable.

#### § § 1318.40

      The following definitions apply throughout this part. All other applicable terms should be given the same meaning as set forth in CEQ's currently effective regulations (40 CFR part 1508) unless such a reading would make the terms inconsistent with the context in which they appear.

      refers to scientifically supported commentary that casts substantial doubt on the agency's methodology or data, but does not mean commentary expressing mere opposition.

      refers to the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining flowing inland waters and reservoirs. _Floodplain_ generally refers to the base floodplain,  that area subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

      includes prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland of statewide importance as defined in 7 CFR part 657.

      refer to such attributes as the capability of floodplains and wetlands to provide natural moderation of floodwaters, water quality maintenance, fish and wildlife habitat, plant habitat, open space, natural beauty, scientific and educational study areas, and recreation.

      refers to the TVA official who manages the NEPA compliance staff and is responsible for overall review of TVA NEPA compliance.

      as used in subpart G of this part, refers to the capability of an action being performed within existing constraints. The test of what is practicable depends on the situation and includes an evaluation of all pertinent factors, such as environmental impact, economic costs, statutory authority, legality, technological achievability, and engineering constraints.

      refers to an area inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does or would support, a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. _Wetland_s do not include temporary human-made ponds associated with active construction projects.

    Subpart B—Initiating the NEPA Process

      § 1318.100   Action formulation.

#### § § 1318.100

      (a) Each office, group, or department (“entity”) within TVA is responsible for integrating environmental considerations into its planning and decision-making processes at the earliest possible time, to appropriately consider potential environmental effects, reduce the risk of delays, and minimize potential conflicts.

      (b) Environmental analyses should be included in or circulated with and reviewed at the same time as other planning documents. This responsibility is to be carried out in accordance with the environmental review procedures contained herein.

      (c) TVA's Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors are the agency's primary decision makers for programs and actions that are likely to be the most consequential from an environmental, financial, and policy standpoint. Other TVA officials and managers are responsible for and make decisions about other TVA actions.

      § 1318.101   NEPA determination.

#### § § 1318.101

      (a) NEPA applies to proposed actions with potential impacts on the human environment that would result in a non-trivial change to the environmental status quo.

      (b) At the earliest possible time, the TVA entity proposing an action shall consult with the staff responsible for NEPA compliance and TVA legal counsel, as appropriate, to determine whether the action requires an environmental review under NEPA and, if so, the level of environmental review.

      (c) The level of review will be in one of the following categories: Categorical Exclusions, Environmental Assessments, and Environmental Impact Statements.

      (d) The NEPA compliance staff shall determine whether the action is already covered under an existing NEPA review, including a programmatic or generic review. Before such an action proceeds, the NEPA compliance staff shall evaluate and adequately document whether the new action is essentially similar to the previously analyzed action, the alternatives previously analyzed are adequate for the new action, there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns that would substantially change the analysis in the existing NEPA review, and there are effects that would result from the new action that were not addressed in the previous analysis

      (e) NEPA and its implementing regulations (both CEQ's and TVA's) provide an established, well-recognized process for appropriately analyzing environmental issues and involving the public.

      (f) TVA may choose to conduct an environmental review when NEPA does not apply.

    Subpart C—Categorical Exclusions

      § 1318.200   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1318.200

      (a) Categories of actions addressed in this section are those that do not normally have, either individually or cumulatively, a significant impact on the human environment and therefore do not require the preparation of an EA or an EIS.

      (b) The TVA entity proposing to initiate an action must determine, in consultation with the NEPA compliance staff, whether the proposed action is categorically excluded.

      (c) In order to find that a proposal can be categorically excluded, TVA will ensure that a larger project is not impermissibly broken down into small parts such that the use of a categorical exclusion for any such small part would irreversibly and irretrievably commit TVA to a particular plan of action for the larger project.

      (d) The actions listed in appendix A of this part are classes of actions that TVA has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (categorical exclusions), subject to review for extraordinary circumstances.

      (e) The use of a categorical exclusion for an action does not relieve TVA from compliance with other statutes or consultations, including, for example, the Endangered Species Act or the National Historic Preservation Act.

      § 1318.201   Extraordinary circumstances.

#### § § 1318.201

      (a) An action that would normally qualify as a categorical exclusion must not be so classified if an extraordinary circumstance is present and cannot be mitigated, including through the application of other environmental regulatory processes. In order to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist, TVA shall consider whether:

      (1) The action has the potential to significantly impact environmental resources, including the following resources:

      (i) Species listed or proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act, or the proposed or designated Critical Habitat for these species,

      (ii) Wetlands or floodplains,

      (iii) Cultural or historical resources,

      (iv) Areas having special designation or recognition such as wild and scenic rivers, parklands, or wilderness areas, and

      (v) Important farmland; and

      (2) The significance of the environmental impacts associated with the proposed action is or may be highly controversial.

      (b) The mere presence of one or more of the resources under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not by itself preclude use of a categorical exclusion. Rather, the determination that extraordinary circumstances are present depends upon the finding of a causal relationship between a proposed action and the potential effect on these resource conditions, and, if such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions.

      § 1318.202   Public notice.

#### § § 1318.202

      TVA may consider providing public notice before a categorical exclusion is used if TVA determines that the public may have relevant and important information relating to the proposal that will assist TVA in its decisionmaking.

    Subpart D—Environmental Assessments

      § 1318.300   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1318.300

      (a) TVA shall prepare an EA for any proposed action not qualifying as a categorical exclusion to determine whether an EIS is necessary or a FONSI can be prepared. An EA need not be initiated (or completed) when TVA determines that it will prepare an EIS.

      (b) An EA shall concisely communicate information and analyses about issues that are potentially significant and reasonable alternatives.

      § 1318.301   Public and stakeholder participation in the EA process.

#### § § 1318.301

      (a) The NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity and other interested offices, may request public involvement in the preparation of an EA or a revision to or a supplement thereof. The type of and format for public involvement shall be selected as appropriate to best facilitate timely and meaningful public input to the EA process. In deciding the extent of public involvement, TVA will consider whether the public has already been provided a meaningful opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposal through other coordinated, regulatory processes.

      (b) TVA will also identify and involve Indian tribes and interested stakeholders including local, State and other Federal agencies.

      (c) A draft EA prepared for an action listed in § 1318.400(a), for which TVA would normally prepare an EIS, shall be circulated for public review and comment.

      (d) TVA will make draft (if applicable) and final EAs and FONSIs available on TVA's public website and by other means upon request to TVA.

      § 1318.302   EA preparation.

#### § § 1318.302

      (a) As soon as practicable after deciding to prepare an EA, the initiating TVA entity, in consultation with NEPA compliance staff, shall convene an internal coordination team to discuss:

      (1) Reasonable alternatives,

      (2) Permit requirements,

      (3) Coordination with other agencies (consistent with § 1318.401),

      (4) Environmental issues,

      (5) Public involvement, and

      (6) A schedule for EA preparation.

      (b) The EA will describe the proposed action and include brief discussions of the purpose and need for action, reasonable alternatives, the no-action alternative (consistent with § 1318.400(e)), the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, measures (if any) to mitigate such impacts, a listing of the agencies and persons consulted, and a list of permits that may be required for the proposed action.

      (c) As appropriate, EAs will identify alternatives that were considered, but not addressed in further detail in the EA.

      (d) The EA will address comments made during any public comment period.

      (e) The EA will briefly provide sufficient data and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI.

      (f) The EA will be reviewed by the NEPA compliance staff and other interested TVA entities, including TVA legal counsel.

      (g) After the EA is finalized and with the concurrence of TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make one of the following determinations:

      (1) A Finding of No Significant Impact,

      (2) The action requires the preparation of an EIS, or

      (3) The EA needs to be supplemented before the significance of potential impacts can be determined.

      § 1318.303   Finding of No Significant Impact.

#### § § 1318.303

      (a) If the NEPA compliance staff concludes, based on an EA, that a proposed action does not require the preparation of an EIS, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with TVA legal counsel and the initiating TVA entity, will prepare a FONSI. The official responsible for NEPA compliance will sign the FONSI.

      (b) A FONSI must concisely summarize the proposed action and the EA, which should be incorporated by reference, and identify any environmental mitigation measures to which TVA commits.

      (c) A FONSI must be made available to the public.

      (d) In the following circumstance, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with TVA legal counsel and the initiating TVA entity, will make a draft EA and draft FONSI available for public review and comment for 30 days before a final determination is made whether to prepare an EIS and before the proposed action may begin:

      (1) The proposed action is, or is closely similar to, an action listed in § 1318.400(a),

      (2) TVA has issued a Notice of Intent that the proposed action would be the subject of an EIS, or

      (3) The nature of the proposed action is one without precedent.

      § 1318.304   Supplements and adoptions.

#### § § 1318.304

      (a) If new information concerning action modifications, alternatives, or probable environmental effects becomes available and there are important components of the proposed action that remain to be implemented, the NEPA compliance staff and TVA legal counsel, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity, will consider whether an EA should be supplemented based on the significance of the new information. The NEPA compliance staff will be responsible for preparing supplements to EAs.

      (b) TVA may adopt an EA prepared by another agency if it determines that the environmental impacts of TVA's action are adequately assessed in the EA. Public involvement must be provided consistent with § 1318.301. The adopted EA and the FONSI issued by TVA must be provided on TVA's public website.

    Subpart E—Environmental Impact Statements

      § 1318.400   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1318.400

      (a) The following actions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) normally will require an EIS:

      (1) New large water resource development and water control projects such as construction and operation of new dams or navigation locks.

      (2) The construction and operation of new major power generating facilities at sites not previously used for industrial purposes.

      (3) The development of integrated resource plans for power generation.

      (4) The development of system-wide reservoir operations plans.

      (5) Any major action whose environmental impacts are expected to be highly controversial.

      (b) If TVA determines that an EIS will not be prepared for an action falling within one of these categories, the basis for the decision must be discussed in the environmental assessment or in a document that is made available to the public.

      (c) An EIS shall describe the proposed action and reasonable alternatives, including no action; analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, alternatives, and identify any mitigation measures; and include a list of the major preparers of the EIS.

      (d) The scope and detail of the EIS shall be reasonably related to the scope and the probable environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternative actions (see 40 CFR 1502.10 through 1502.18).

      (e) The no-action alternative in an EIS (or an EA) should represent the environmental status quo and should be formulated to provide the environmental baseline from which the proposed action and other alternatives can be assessed even when TVA is legally required to take action. For proposed changes to existing programs or plans, continuation of the existing program or plan and associated environmental impacts should be considered the no-action alternative.

      § 1318.401   Lead and cooperating agency determinations.

#### § § 1318.401

      (a) As soon as practicable after the decision is made to prepare an EIS (or EA), the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity and TVA legal counsel, shall determine whether inviting other Federal, State, or local agencies to participate in the preparation of the EIS as lead, joint lead (40 CFR 1501.5), or cooperating agencies (40 CFR 1501.6) is necessary.

      (b) If TVA is requested to participate in the preparation of an EIS (or EA) of another Federal agency, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other interested TVA entities, will determine if TVA should become a cooperating agency.

      § 1318.402   Scoping process.

#### § § 1318.402

      (a) As soon as practicable after the decision to prepare an EIS is made, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other TVA entities, will identify preliminary action alternatives, probable environmental issues, and necessary environmental permits, and a schedule for EIS preparation.

      (b) The scoping process may include interagency scoping sessions to coordinate an action with and obtain inputs from other interested agencies (including local, State, and other Federal agencies, as well as Indian tribes).

      (c) The NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other TVA entities, will determine whether public scoping meetings should be held in addition to seeking comments by other means. Meeting types and formats should be selected to facilitate timely and meaningful public input into the EIS process.

      (d) As soon as practicable in the scoping process, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity and TVA legal counsel, will prepare and publish in the  a notice of intent to prepare an EIS. This notice will briefly describe the proposed action, possible alternatives, and potentially affected environmental resources. In addition, the notice will identify issues that TVA has tentatively determined to be insignificant and which will not be discussed in detail in the EIS. The scoping process will be described and, if a scoping meeting will be held, the notice should state where and when the meeting is to occur if that has been determined. The notice will identify the person in TVA who can supply additional information about the action and describe how to submit comments.

      (e) There will be a minimum public comment period of 30 days from the date of publication of the notice of intent in the  to allow other interested agencies and the public an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed scope of the EIS.

      (f) On the basis of input received, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other TVA entities, will determine whether to modify the schedule or scope of the EIS.

      (g) At the close of the scoping process, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with the other TVA entities, will identify the following components in paragraphs (g)(1) through (8) for use in preparing the DEIS:

      (1) Purpose and need of the proposed action.

      (2) Reasonable action alternatives.

      (3) Environmental issues to be addressed in detail.

      (4) Environmental issues that should be mentioned but not addressed in detail.

      (5) Lead and cooperating agency roles and responsibilities.

      (6) Related environmental documents.

      (7) Other environmental review and consultation requirements.

      (8) Delegation of DEIS work assignments to TVA entities and other agencies.

      (h) If a scoping report summarizing the preceding EIS components is prepared, it must be made available to the public.

      § 1318.403   DEIS preparation, transmittal, and review.

#### § § 1318.403

      (a) Based on information obtained and decisions made during the scoping process, the NEPA compliance staff, in cooperation with the initiating TVA entity and other interested TVA entities, will prepare the preliminary DEIS using an appropriate format (see 40 CFR 1502.10).

      (b) During preparation of the DEIS, the NEPA compliance staff will involve any cooperating agencies to obtain their input. If a cooperating agency's analysis of an environmental issue or impact differs from TVA's, those differences should be resolved before the DEIS is released for public comment or the cooperating agency's position should be set forth and addressed in the DEIS.

      (c) After approval of the DEIS by the official responsible for NEPA compliance, the senior manager of the initiating TVA entity, and TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make the DEIS available to the public; other interested Federal, State, and local agencies; and other entities and individuals who have expressed an interest in the type of action or commented on the scope of the EIS. The NEPA compliance staff will then file the DEIS with EPA for publication of its notice of availability in the .

      (d) TVA will make the DEIS available on its public website and provide it by other means upon request.

      (e) A minimum of 45 days from the date of publication of the notice of availability in the  must be provided for public comment. TVA may extend the public comment period in its discretion.

      (f) Materials to be made available to the public should be provided to the public without charge to the extent practicable.

      § 1318.404   FEIS preparation and transmittal.

#### § § 1318.404

      (a) At the close of the DEIS public comment period, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity and other interested TVA entities, will determine what is needed for the preparation of an FEIS.

      (b) If changes to the DEIS in response to comments are minor and confined to factual corrections or explanations of why the comments do not warrant additional TVA response, TVA may issue errata sheets instead of rewriting the DEIS. In such cases, only the comments, the responses (including explanations why the comments do not warrant changes to the DEIS), and the changes need be circulated. The entire document with a new cover sheet shall be filed as the FEIS (40 CFR 1506.9). If other more extensive changes are required, the NEPA compliance staff, in cooperation with other interested TVA entities, will prepare an FEIS utilizing an appropriate format (see 40 CFR 1502.10).

      (c) The FEIS should address all substantive comments on the DEIS that TVA receives before the close of the public comment period by responding specifically to the comments and/or by revising the text of the DEIS. Comments that are substantively similar should be summarized and addressed together.

      (d) After approval of the FEIS by the official responsible for NEPA compliance, the senior manager of the initiating TVA entity, and TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make the FEIS available to the public; other interested Federal, State, and local agencies; and other entities and individuals who have expressed an interest in the type of action or commented on the DEIS. The NEPA compliance staff will then file the FEIS with EPA for publication of its notice of availability in the .

      (e) TVA will make the FEIS available on its public website and provide it by other means upon request.

      § 1318.405   Agency decision.

#### § § 1318.405

      (a) TVA shall not make a decision regarding a proposed action for which an EIS has been issued until 30 days after a notice of availability of the FEIS has been published in the  or 90 days after a notice of availability of the DEIS has been published in the  whichever is later.

      (b) After release of the FEIS and after TVA makes a decision about the proposed action, a ROD must be prepared by the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with TVA legal counsel and the initiating TVA entity (see 40 CFR 1505.2). The ROD will normally include the items in the following paragraphs (b)(1) through (6):

      (1) The decision;

      (2) The basis for the decision and preferences among alternatives;

      (3) The alternative(s) considered to be environmentally preferable;

      (4) A summary of important environmental impacts;

      (5) The monitoring, reporting, and administrative arrangements that have been made; and

      (6) The measures that would mitigate or minimize adverse environmental impacts to which TVA commits to implement (see 40 CFR 1505.2(c)).

      (c) A ROD will be made available to the public.

      (d) Until a ROD is made available to the public, no action should be taken to implement an alternative that would have adverse environmental impacts or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.

      § 1318.406   Supplements.

#### § § 1318.406

      If TVA makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or there is significant new information relevant to environmental concerns, and important components of the proposed action remain to be implemented, the NEPA compliance staff and TVA legal counsel, in consultation with the initiating TVA entity, will determine how the FEIS should be supplemented. The NEPA compliance staff will be responsible for preparing a supplement to an EIS.

      § 1318.407   EIS adoption.

#### § § 1318.407

      (a) TVA may adopt another agency's EIS, or a portion thereof, provided that the NEPA compliance staff determines that the EIS or portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate EIS.

      (b) If the NEPA compliance staff determines that the actions covered by the other agency's EIS and TVA's proposed action are substantially the same, TVA may adopt the other agency's EIS as TVA's FEIS (§ 1318.404). In making this determination, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other interested TVA entities, will consider whether the scope and analyses in the other agency's EIS adequately address the TVA action. TVA will also review to ensure the scientific accuracy of the analysis and conclusions drawn. TVA must make this determination and the adopted EIS available on its public website.

      (c) If the NEPA compliance staff determines that the actions covered by the other agency's EIS and TVA's proposed action are not substantially the same, TVA will supplement the other agency's EIS and treat it as TVA's DEIS, including circulating it for comment (§ 1318.403).

      (d) If TVA cooperated in the preparation of an EIS that TVA determines adequately addresses its proposed action, TVA may make a decision about its proposed action no sooner than 30 days after notice of availability of the FEIS was published in the  A record of that decision should be prepared consistent with § 1318.405.

      (e) If TVA did not cooperate in the preparation of an EIS that TVA determines adequately addresses its proposed action and that it proposes to adopt, NEPA compliance staff will transmit notice of its adoption to EPA for publication of a notice of availability and circulate the FEIS for public comment as to its assessment of impacts as they relate to TVA's proposed action. TVA may make a decision about its proposed action no sooner than 30 days after notice of availability of the FEIS is published in the  A record of decision will be prepared consistent with § 1318.405.

      (f) TVA will provide notice of its adoption to other interested Federal, State, and local agencies, other entities, and individuals.

    Subpart F—Miscellaneous Procedures

      § 1318.500   Public participation.

#### § § 1318.500

      (a) TVA's policy is to encourage meaningful public participation in and awareness of its proposed actions and decisions. This policy is implemented through various mechanisms.

      (b) The type of and format for public participation will be selected as appropriate to best facilitate timely and meaningful public input.

      (c) TVA will maintain a public website at which it posts information about TVA activities and programs, including ongoing and recently completed EAs and EISs.

      (d) When opportunities for public participation are provided, TVA will notify the public that comments submitted to TVA on the NEPA document and the names and addresses of those commenting may be made available for public inspection.

      § 1318.501   Mitigation commitment identification, auditing, and reporting.

#### § § 1318.501

      (a) All appropriate measures to mitigate expected significant adverse environmental impacts (“mitigation measures”) must be identified in an EA or EIS. Those mitigation measures to which TVA commits must be identified in the associated FONSI or ROD (or the documentation, if any, prepared for a categorical exclusion).

      (b) Each mitigation commitment that is not required under regulations will be assigned by the NEPA compliance staff to the TVA entity responsible for implementing the commitment. The NEPA compliance staff should consult with the responsible entities to resolve assignment conflicts, identify supporting offices, and determine implementation schedules.

      (c) The responsible entity shall report to the NEPA compliance staff the status of mitigation commitments periodically or whenever a specific request is made.

      (d) The NEPA compliance staff must ensure that commitments are met and will verify commitment progress.

      (e) Circumstances may arise that warrant modifying or cancelling previously made commitments. The decision to modify or cancel a commitment will be made by the NEPA compliance staff in consultation with TVA legal counsel, after considering the environmental significance of such a change.

      § 1318.502   Tiering.

#### § § 1318.502

      TVA may rely on tiering for the environmental review of proposed actions. Tiering involves coverage of general matters in broader EISs or EAs on programs, plans, and policies, and subsequent narrower analyses of implementing actions that incorporate by reference the broader analyses ( 40 CFR 1508.28).

      § 1318.503   Programmatic and generic NEPA documents.

#### § § 1318.503

      (a) A programmatic or generic EA or EIS may be prepared to address a proposed program, policy, or plan, or a proposed action that has a wide geographic scope.

      (b) A programmatic EA or EIS can support high-level or broad decisionmaking, and can provide the foundation for the efficient review of specific tiered implementing actions.

      (c) Ongoing or previously planned and approved actions that are within the scope of a programmatic review may continue during the programmatic review period, so long as the criteria at 40 CFR 1506.1(c) are met.

      (d) The identification of significant impacts in a programmatic EIS does not preclude the review of specific implementing actions in an EA that tiers from the programmatic EIS if the implementing actions would not result in new or different significant impacts.

      § 1318.504   Private applicants.

#### § § 1318.504

      (a) When a private applicant, individual, or other non-Federal entity (“private entity”) proposes to undertake an action that will require TVA's approval or involvement, the contacted TVA entity will notify the NEPA compliance staff. That staff must determine, in consultation with TVA legal counsel, whether NEPA is triggered and the scope of the review of TVA's proposed action.

      (b) TVA compliance staff will provide the private entity information on its responsibilities for assisting TVA in conducting the necessary NEPA review. At TVA's discretion, this can include providing TVA detailed information about the scope and nature of the proposed action, environmental analyses and studies, and copies of associated environmental permit applications submitted to other Federal, State, or local agencies.

      (c) In identifying reasonable alternatives, TVA should consider the applicant's purpose and need, in addition to TVA's purpose and need.

      (d) A private entity may be allowed to prepare draft and final EAs for TVA's review and approval, but TVA remains responsible for the adequacy of the documents and the conduct of associated EA process.

      (e) A private entity normally will be required to reimburse TVA for its costs in reviewing the private entity's proposed action.

      (f) Participation of a private entity in a TVA NEPA review, including reimbursement of TVA's costs, does not commit TVA to favorable action on a request.

      § 1318.505   Non-TVA EISs.

#### § § 1318.505

      (a) The NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other interested TVA entities, will coordinate the review of any EIS provided by another Federal agency to TVA for comment.

      (b) The NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with TVA legal counsel as appropriate, will prepare comments on any such EIS and transmit them to the initiating agency (see 40 CFR 1503.2 and 1503.3).

      § 1318.506   Documents.

#### § § 1318.506

      The NEPA compliance staff must keep on file all final and approved environmental documents either in paper form or electronically, in accordance with TVA's records retention policy.

      § 1318.507   Reducing paperwork and delay.

#### § § 1318.507

      (a) These procedures are to be interpreted and applied with the aim of reducing paperwork and the delay of both the assessment and implementation of a proposed action.

      (b) Data and analyses should be commensurate with the importance of associated impacts. Less important material should be summarized, consolidated, or referenced.

      (c) An environmental document may be combined with any other document to reduce duplication and paperwork.

      (d) Review of a proposed action under these procedures may be consolidated with other reviews where such consolidation would reduce duplication or increase efficiency.

      § 1318.508   Supplemental guidance.

#### § § 1318.508

      The NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with interested TVA entities and with concurrence of TVA legal counsel, may issue supplemental or explanatory guidance to these procedures.

      § 1318.509   Substantial compliance.

#### § § 1318.509

      Substantial compliance with these procedures must be achieved. Minor deviations approved by the official responsible for NEPA compliance do not give rise to any independent cause of action.

      § 1318.510   Emergency actions.

#### § § 1318.510

      (a) The NEPA compliance staff may consolidate, modify, or omit provisions of these procedures for actions necessary in an emergency.

      (b) Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations, TVA will consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements for those actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other actions remain subject to NEPA review (see 40 CFR 1506.11).

      (c) The NEPA compliance staff, with the concurrence of TVA legal counsel, must determine whether such changes would substantially comply with the intent of these procedures.

      (d) The official responsible for NEPA compliance shall document the determination that an emergency exists and describe the responsive action(s) taken at the time the emergency exists. The form of that documentation is within the discretion of that official.

      § 1318.511   Modification of assignments.

#### § § 1318.511

      The assignments and responsibilities identified for TVA entities in these procedures can be modified by agreement of the entities involved or by the direction of TVA's Chief Executive Officer.

      § 1318.512   Status reports.

#### § § 1318.512

      Information on the status of EISs and EAs under development shall be published on TVA's public website.

    Subpart G—Floodplains and Wetlands

      § 1318.600   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1318.600

      (a) The review of a proposed action undertaken in accordance with §§ 1318.200, 1318.300, and 1318.400 that potentially affects floodplains or wetlands must include a floodplain or wetlands evaluation that is consistent with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) and Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) pertaining to floodplains or wetlands, respectively, as required by this section.

      (b) Floodplain evaluations must apply any existing Federal flood risk management standard to federally-funded projects.

      (c) A wetland evaluation under Executive Order 11990 is not required for the issuance of permits, licenses, or allocations to private parties for activities involving wetlands on non-Federal lands.

      § 1318.601   Area of impact.

#### § § 1318.601

      (a) If a proposed action will potentially occur in or affect wetlands or floodplains, the initiating TVA entity, as soon as practicable in the planning process, will request the appropriate TVA staff with expertise in floodplain or wetland impact evaluations (“TVA staff”) to determine whether the proposed action will occur in or affect a wetland or floodplain and the level of impact, if any, on the wetland or floodplain.

      (b) Further floodplain or wetland evaluation is unnecessary if the TVA staff determines that the proposed action:

      (1) Is outside the floodplain or wetland,

      (2) Has no identifiable impacts on a floodplain or wetland, and

      (3) Does not directly or indirectly support floodplain development or wetland alteration.

      § 1318.602   Actions that will affect floodplains or wetlands.

#### § § 1318.602

      (a) When a proposed action can otherwise be categorically excluded under § 1318.200, no additional floodplain or wetland evaluation is required if:

      (1) The initiating TVA entity determines that there is no practicable alternative that will avoid affecting floodplains or wetlands and that all practicable measures to minimize impacts of the proposed action to floodplains or wetlands are incorporated and

      (2) The TVA staff determines that impacts on the floodplain or wetland would be minor.

      (b) If the action requires an EA or an EIS, the evaluation must consider:

      (1) The effect of the proposed action on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values and

      (2) Alternatives to the proposed action that would eliminate or minimize such effects.

      (c) The initiating TVA entity must determine if there is no practicable alternative to siting in a floodplain or constructing in a wetland. Upon concurrence by the NEPA compliance staff in consultation with TVA legal counsel and TVA staff with expertise in floodplain or wetland impact evaluations, this determination shall be final. If a determination of no practicable alternative is made, all practicable measures to minimize impacts of the proposed action on the floodplain or wetland must be implemented. If at any time prior to commencement of the action it is determined that there is a practicable alternative that will avoid affecting floodplains or wetlands, the proposed action must not proceed.

      § 1318.603   Public notice.

#### § § 1318.603

      (a) Once a determination of no practicable alternative is made in accordance with § 1318.602, the initiating office must notify the public of a proposed action's potential impact on floodplains or wetlands if the proposed action is subject to executive order and not already covered by class review. Public notice of actions affecting floodplains or wetlands may be combined with any notice published by TVA or another Federal agency if such a notice generally meets the minimum requirements set forth in this section. Issuance of a draft or final EA or EIS for public review and comment will satisfy this notice requirement.

      (b) Public notices must at a minimum:

      (1) Briefly describe the proposed action and the potential impact on the floodplain or wetland;

      (2) Briefly identify alternative actions considered and explain why a determination of no practicable alternative has been proposed;

      (3) Briefly discuss measures that would be taken to minimize or mitigate floodplain or wetland impacts;

      (4) State when appropriate whether the action conforms to applicable Federal, State or local floodplain protection standards;

      (5) Specify a reasonable period of time within which the public can comment on the proposal; and

      (6) Identify the TVA official who can provide additional information on the proposed action and to whom comments should be sent.

      (c) Such notices must be issued in a manner designed to bring the proposed action to the attention of those members of the public likely to be interested in or affected by the action's potential impact on the floodplain or wetland.

      (d) TVA must consider all relevant and timely comments received in response to a notice and reevaluate the action as appropriate to take such comments into consideration before the proposed action is implemented.

      § 1318.604   Disposition of real property.

#### § § 1318.604

      When TVA property in a floodplain or wetland is proposed for lease, easement, right-of-way, or disposal to non-federal public or private parties and the action will not result in disturbance of the floodplain or wetland, a floodplain or wetland evaluation is not required. The conveyance document, however, must:

      (a) Require the other party to comply with all applicable Federal, State or local floodplain and wetland regulations, and

      (b) Identify other appropriate restrictions to minimize destruction, loss, or degradation of floodplains and wetlands and to preserve and enhance their natural and beneficial values, except when prohibited by law or unenforceable by TVA, or otherwise, the property must be withheld from conveyance or use.

      § 1318.605   General and class reviews.

#### § § 1318.605

      In lieu of site-specific reviews, TVA may conduct general or class reviews of similar or repetitive activities that occur in floodplains.
