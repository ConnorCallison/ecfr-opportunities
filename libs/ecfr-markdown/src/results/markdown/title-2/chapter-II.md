#### § § 200.1

        The following is a list of definitions of key terms frequently used in 2 CFR part 200. Definitions found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply to particular programs take precedence over the following definitions.

For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

        means the (total) cost of the asset including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use. For example, acquisition cost for equipment means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired. _Acquisition cost_s for software include those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Ancillary charges such as taxes, duty, protective in transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in or excluded from the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.

        means a payment that a Federal agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism and payment method before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program purposes.

        means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objective(s), in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship. The process may entail assigning a cost(s) directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives.

The term auditor does not include internal auditors of nonprofit organizations.

        means the financial plan for the Federal award that the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves during the Federal award process or in subsequent amendments to the Federal award. It may include the Federal and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

When designating “other clusters,” a State must identify the Federal awards included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, consistent with § 200.332. A cluster of programs must be considered one program when determining major programs as described in § 200.518, and with the exception of R&D as described in § 200.501(d), whether a program-specific audit may be elected.

        means the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's written determination, provided to the auditee, of the adequacy of the auditee's proposed corrective actions to address the findings based on its evaluation of the audit findings and proposed corrective actions.

        means an individual procurement transaction for supplies or services, the aggregate amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold. _Micro-purchase_s comprise a subset of a recipient's or subrecipient's small purchases using informal procurement methods as set forth in § 200.320.

        means the dollar amount at or below which a recipient or subrecipient may purchase property, or services using micro-purchase procedures (see § 200.320). Generally, except as provided in § 200.320, the micro-purchase threshold for procurement activities administered under Federal awards is not to exceed the amount set by the FAR at 48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1, unless a higher threshold is requested by the recipient or subrecipient and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

        means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $50,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs, and the portion of each subaward in excess of $50,000. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

        means an award made by the Federal agency to specific recipients in accordance with statutory, eligibility, and compliance requirements, such that in keeping with specific statutory authority, the Federal agency cannot exercise judgment (“discretion”). A non-discretionary award amount could be specifically determined or by formula.

        means a State, local government, Indian Tribe, Institution of Higher Education (IHE), or nonprofit organization that carries out a Federal award as a recipient or subrecipient.

        means any organization that:

        (1) Is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest;

        (2) Is not organized primarily for profit;

        (3) Uses net proceeds to maintain, improve, or expand the organization's operations; and

        (4) Is not an IHE.

        means a formal announcement of the availability of Federal funding through a financial assistance program from a Federal agency. The notice of funding opportunity provides information on the award, such as who is eligible to apply, the evaluation criteria for selecting a recipient or subrecipient, the required components of an application, and how to submit the application. The notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or some other term.

        means the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget.

        means the Federal agency that provides the predominant amount of funding directly (direct funding) (as listed on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see § 200.510(b)) to a recipient or subrecipient unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total Federal expenditures (as direct and sub-awards) by the recipient or subrecipient, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated oversight agency for audit. When there is no direct funding, the Federal agency that is the predominant source of pass-through funding must assume the oversight responsibilities. The duties of the oversight agency for audit and the process for any reassignments are described in § 200.513(b).

        generally means an individual participating in or attending program activities under a Federal award, such as trainings or conferences, but who is not responsible for implementation of the Federal award. Individuals committing effort to the development or delivery of program activities under a Federal award (such as consultants, project personnel, or staff members of a recipient or subrecipient) are not participants. Examples of participants may include community members participating in a community outreach program, members of the public whose perspectives or input are sought as part of a program, students, or conference attendees.

        means direct costs that support participants (see definition for  in § 200.1) and their involvement in a Federal award, such as stipends, subsistence allowances, travel allowances, registration fees, temporary dependent care, and per diem paid directly to or on behalf of participants.

        means a recipient or subrecipient that provides a subaward to a subrecipient (including lower tier subrecipients) to carry out part of a Federal program. The authority of the pass-through entity under this part flows through the subaward agreement between the pass-through entity and subrecipient.

        means a measurable target level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable objective, against which actual achievement can be compared, including a goal expressed as a quantitative standard, value, or rate. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports (to be evaluated in accordance with agency policy).

        means the time interval between the start and end date of a Federal award, which may include one or more budget periods. Identification of the period of performance in the Federal award consistent with § 200.211(b)(5) does not commit the Federal agency to fund the award beyond the currently approved budget period.

        means property other than real property. It may be tangible or intangible.

        means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Some PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, websites, and university listings. The definition of PII is not attached to any single category of information or technology. Instead, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. Non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available, in any medium and from any source, that could be used to identify an individual when combined with other available information.

        means the written approval obtained in advance by an authorized official of a Federal agency or pass-through entity of certain costs or programmatic decisions.

        means gross income earned by the recipient or subrecipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in § 200.307(c). _Program income_ includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees, and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See § 200.407. See also 35 U.S.C. 200-212 “Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards,” which applies to inventions made under Federal awards.

        means total allowable costs incurred under a Federal award and all cost sharing, including third-party contributions.

        means _real property_ or _personal property._ See this section's definitions of  and

        means PII (see definition in this section), except for PII that must be disclosed by law. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, social security number; passport number; credit card numbers; clearances, bank numbers; biometrics; date and place of birth; mother's maiden name; criminal, medical and financial records; and educational transcripts.

        has the meaning given in paragraphs (1) through (3).

        (1)  means an amount, expended or received from a Federal award, that in the auditor's judgment:

        (i) Is noncompliant or suspected noncompliant with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award;

        (ii) At the time of the audit, lacked adequate documentation to support compliance; or

        (iii) Appeared unreasonable and did not reflect the actions a prudent person would take in the circumstances.

        (2) The questioned cost amount under (1)(ii) is calculated as if the portion of a transaction that lacked adequate documentation were confirmed noncompliant.

        (3) There is no questioned cost solely because of:

        (i) Deficiencies in internal control; or

        (ii) Noncompliance with the reporting type of compliance requirement (described in the compliance supplement) if this noncompliance does not affect the amount expended or received from the Federal award.

        (4)  means a questioned cost specifically identified by the auditor. _Known questioned cost_s are a subset of likely questioned costs.

        (5)  means the auditor's best estimate of total questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs. _Likely questioned cost_s are developed by extrapolating from audit evidence obtained, for example, by projecting known questioned costs identified in an audit sample to the entire population from which the sample was drawn. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the likely questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs.

        (6) Questioned costs are not improper payments until reviewed and confirmed to be improper payments as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C.

        means land, including land improvements, structures, and appurtenances thereto, and legal interests in land, including fee interest, licenses, rights of way, and easements. _Real property_ excludes moveable machinery and equipment.

        means an entity that receives a Federal award directly from a Federal agency to carry out an activity under a Federal program. The term recipient does not include subrecipients or individuals that are participants or beneficiaries of the award.

        means a Federal award for which the start date is contiguous with, or closely follows, the end of the expiring Federal award. The start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of performance.

        means all basic and applied research activities and all development activities performed by a recipient or subrecipient. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities use the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function. “Research” is the systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research to produce useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including designing and developing prototypes and processes.

        means the dollar amount below which a recipient or subrecipient may purchase property or services using small purchase methods (see § 200.320). Recipients and subrecipients adopt small purchase procedures to expedite the purchase of items at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The simplified acquisition threshold set in the FAR at 48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1 is used in this part as the simplified acquisition threshold for secondary procurement activities administered under Federal awards. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold, which is less than or equal to the dollar value established in the FAR, based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. Recipients and subrecipients should also determine if local government purchasing laws apply. This threshold must never exceed the dollar value established in the FAR.

        means _equipment_ that is used only for research, medical, scientific, or other similar technical activities. Examples of special purpose equipment include microscopes, x-ray machines, surgical instruments, spectrometers, and associated software. See also the definitions of  and  in this section.

        means any _State_ of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any agency or instrumentality thereof exclusive of local governments.

        means Federal awards under those programs of general student assistance, such as those authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1070-1099d), which the U.S. Department of Education administers, and similar programs provided by other Federal agencies. It does not include Federal awards under programs that provide fellowships or similar Federal awards to students on a competitive basis or for specified studies or research.

        means an award provided by a pass-through entity to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to contribute to the goals and objectives of the project by carrying out part of a Federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor, beneficiary, or participant. A subaward may be provided through any form of legal agreement consistent with criteria in with § 200.331, including an agreement the pass-through entity considers a contract.

        means an entity that receives a subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal award. The term subrecipient does not include a beneficiary or participant. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal agency.

        means an entity in which more than 50 percent of the entity is owned or controlled directly by a parent corporation or through another subsidiary of a parent corporation.

        means all tangible personal property other than those described in the  definition. A computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is below the lesser of the capitalization level established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes or $10,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. See this section's definitions of  and

        means the cost of using communication technologies such as mobile phones, landlines, and the internet.

        means the action a Federal agency or pass-through entity takes to discontinue a Federal award, in whole or in part, at any time before the planned end date of the period of performance. _Termination_ does not include discontinuing a Federal award due to a lack of available funds.

        means the value of non-cash contributions ( property or services) that:

        (1) Benefit a project or program funded by a Federal award; and

        (2) Are contributed by non-Federal third parties, without charge, to a recipient or subrecipient under a Federal award.

        means financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but not paid (liquidated) for financial reports prepared on a cash basis. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, these are financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but for which expenditures have not been recorded.

        means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the recipient or subrecipient has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the recipient's or subrecipient's unliquidated financial obligations and expenditures under the Federal award from the cumulative amount of funds the Federal agency or pass-through entity authorized the recipient or subrecipient to obligate.

        means cost sharing specifically pledged voluntarily in the proposal's budget on the part of the recipient or subrecipient, which becomes a binding requirement of the Federal award. See § 200.306.

    Subpart B—General Provisions

      § 200.100   Purpose.

#### § § 200.100

      (a)  (1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. Federal agencies must not impose additional requirements except as allowed in §§ 200.102, 200.211, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive order.

      (2) This part provides Federal agencies with the policy for collecting and submitting information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and communicating this information to the public. It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It also sets forth how the General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies implement the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106).

      (b)  Subparts B through D set forth the uniform administrative requirements for Federal financial assistance. This includes establishing requirements for Federal agencies management of Federal financial assistance programs before a Federal award is made, and requirements that Federal agencies may impose on recipients and subrecipients throughout the lifecycle of a Federal award.

      (c)  Subpart E establishes principles for determining allowable costs incurred by recipients and subrecipients under Federal awards. These principles are for the purpose of cost determination. They do not address the circumstances nor dictate the extent of Federal Government funding of a particular program or project.

      (d)  Subpart F is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Subpart F sets forth the standards for achieving consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. Subpart F also provides the policies and procedures for Federal agencies or pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.

      § 200.101   Applicability.

#### § § 200.101

      (a)  (1) Subparts A through F apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. As provided in paragraph (a)(2), subparts A through E may also apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to other entities.

      (2) Federal agencies must apply subparts A though F of this part to non-Federal entities unless a particular section of this part or Federal statute provides otherwise. Federal agencies may apply subparts A through E of this part to Federal agencies, for-profit organizations, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations as permitted in agency regulations or program statutes, except when a Federal agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international responsibilities of the United States or the laws of a foreign government. Subpart F only applies to non-Federal entities as defined in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Federal agencies should apply the requirements to all recipients in a consistent and equitable manner to the extent permitted within applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.

      (3) Throughout subparts A through F, the word “must” indicates a requirement. The words “should” or “may” indicate a recommended approach and permit discretion.

      (4) Throughout subparts A through E, when the word “or” is used between the terms “recipient” and “subrecipient,” any requirements or recommendations in the relevant provisions of this part apply to the recipient, the subrecipient, or both, as applicable. The use of “or” between recipient and subrecipient does not mean that applicable requirements or recommendations only apply to one of these entities unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

      (b)  (1) Paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of Federal financial assistance. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section explain additional exceptions related to governing provisions and Federal program applicability. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and any other sections of this part addressing pass-through entities.

      (2) Subpart A (Acronyms and Definitions) and subpart B (General Provisions) apply to all Federal financial assistance, except that §§ 200.111 (English language), 200.112 (Conflict of interest), and 200.113 (Mandatory disclosures) do not apply to agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance.

      (3) Subpart C (Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards) and subpart D (Post Federal Award Requirements) only apply to grants and cooperative agreements with the following exceptions:

      (i) Section 200.203 (Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs) also applies to agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance;

      (ii) Section 200.216 (Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment or services) applies to loans and grants (see Pub. L. 115-232, Div. A, Title VIII, § 889, as amended); and

      (iii) Sections 200.303 (Internal controls) and 200.331 through 200.333 (Subrecipient monitoring and management) also apply to all types of Federal financial assistance.

      (4) Subpart E (Cost Principles) applies to grants and cooperative agreements, but does not apply to the following:

      (i) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements;

      (ii) Fixed amount awards, except for §§ 200.400(g), 200.402 through 200.405, and 200.407(d), which do apply;

      (iii) Agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance; and

      (iv) Federal awards to hospitals (see Appendix IX—Hospital Cost Principles).

      (5) Subpart F (Audit Requirements) only applies to the following items when awarded to a non-Federal entity:

      (i) Grants and cooperative agreements (including fixed amount awards);

      (ii) Contracts and subcontracts awarded under the FAR (except for fixed price contracts and subcontracts);

      (iii) Agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance; and

      (iv) Any other form of Federal financial assistance as defined by the Single Audit Act Amendment of 1996 (codified at 31 U.S.C. 7501-7507).

      (c)  (1) Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity. See also paragraph (b)(5)(ii) on audit requirements. For both paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3):

      (i) In cases of conflict between the requirements of applicable portions of this part and the terms and conditions of the contract, the terms and conditions of the contract and the FAR prevail.

      (ii) When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract or subcontract, they also take precedence over this part.

      (iii) In addition, costs that are identified as unallowable under 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) and as stated in the FAR (48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603) are always unallowable.

      (2)  When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F are applicable.

      (3)  When a non-Federal entity is awarded a fixed-price contract or subcontract under the FAR, only subpart A, subpart B (except for §§ 200.111, 200.112, and 200.113), subpart D (only at § 200.303 and §§ 200.331 through 200.333), and subpart E are applicable to the contract, except that subpart E is not applicable to fixed-price contracts and subcontracts that are not negotiated.

      (d)  With the exception of subpart F, which is required by the Single Audit Act, Federal statutes or regulations govern in any circumstances where they conflict with the provisions of this part. For agreements with Indian Tribes, this includes the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended (see 25 U.S.C. 5301-5423).

      (e)  Except for §§ 200.203, 200.216, and 200.331 through 200.333, the requirements in subparts C, D, and E do not apply to the following programs:

      (1) The block grant awards authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (including Community Services), except to the extent that subpart E apply to subrecipients of Community Services Block Grant funds pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9916(a)(1)(B);

      § 200.102   Exceptions.

#### § § 200.102

      (a)  Except for subpart F, OMB may allow exceptions from requirements of this part for classes of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when the exceptions are not prohibited by statute. For example, Federal agencies may request exceptions in support of innovative program designs that apply a risk-based, data-driven framework to alleviate select compliance requirements and hold recipients accountable for good performance. See also § 200.206. Federal agencies may also request exceptions in emergency situations. When OMB allows an exception to requirements of this part, the Federal agency remains responsible for ensuring the exception is applied to Federal awards in a manner consistent with Federal statutes and regulations.

      (b)  A Federal agency may adjust requirements to a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when required by Federal statutes or regulations, except for the requirements in subpart F. Except for provisions in subpart F, when a Federal statute requires exceptions to requirements of this part for a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, a Federal agency does not need OMB approval to allow those exceptions. See also § 200.106.

      (c)  Federal agencies may allow exceptions to requirements of this part on a case-by-case basis for individual Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, except when the exceptions are prohibited by law or other approval is expressly required by this part. Only the cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize exceptions related to cost allocation plans or indirect cost rate proposals. A Federal agency may also apply less restrictive requirements when issuing fixed amount awards (see § 200.1), except for those requirements imposed by statute or in subpart F.

      § 200.103   Authorities.

#### § § 200.103

      This part is issued under the following authorities.

      (a) Subparts B through D are authorized under 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act, Functions of the Deputy Director for Management); the Federal Program Information Act (Pub, L. 95-220 and Pub. L. 98-169, as amended, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6101-6106); the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-224, as amended, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6301-6309); 41 U.S.C. 1101-1131 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 and Executive Order 11541 (“Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive Office of the President”); and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507).

      (b) Subpart E is authorized under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended; the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1101-1126); the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (31 U.S.C. 503-504); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970; and Executive Order 11541, “Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive Office of the President.” OMB also relies on authority under 31 U.S.C. 503 and 31 U.S.C. 6307.

      (c) Subpart F is authorized under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (codified at 31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). OMB also relies on authority under 31 U.S.C. 503 and 31 U.S.C. 6307.

      § 200.104   Supersession.

#### § § 200.104

      This part superseded previous OMB guidance issued under Title 2, subtitle A, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations and certain OMB circulars related to uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

      § 200.105   Effect on other issuances.

#### § § 200.105

      (a)  For Federal awards made subject to this part by a Federal agency, this part takes precedence over any administrative requirements, program manuals, handbooks, and other non-regulatory materials that are inconsistent with the requirements of this part upon implementation by the Federal agency, except to the extent that they are required by statute or authorized in accordance with § 200.102.

      (b)  Agencies may only impose legally binding requirements on recipients and subrecipients through:

      (1) Notice and public comment procedures through an approved agency process, including as authorized by this part, other statutes, or regulations; or

      (2) Incorporating requirements into the terms and conditions of a Federal award as permitted by Federal statute, regulation, or this part.

      § 200.106   Agency implementation.

#### § § 200.106

      The specific requirements and responsibilities of Federal agencies, non-Federal entities, recipients, and subrecipients are set forth in this part. Federal agencies making Federal awards to non-Federal entities must implement the language in subparts C through F of this part in codified regulations unless different provisions are required by Federal statute or are approved by OMB.

      § 200.107   OMB responsibilities.

#### § § 200.107

      OMB will review Federal agency regulations and implementation of this part. OMB will provide interpretations of policy requirements and assistance to ensure effective, efficient, and consistent implementation. Any exceptions will be subject to approval by OMB and only with adequate justification from the Federal agency.

      § 200.108   Inquiries.

#### § § 200.108

      Inquiries from Federal agencies concerning this part may be directed to OMB. Inquiries from recipients or subrecipients should be addressed to the Federal agency, the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the cognizant agency for audit, or the pass-through entity as appropriate.

      § 200.109   Review date.

#### § § 200.109

      OMB will review this part periodically.

      § 200.110   Effective date.

#### § § 200.110

      (a) The standards set forth in this part affecting the administration of Federal awards by Federal agencies become effective once implemented by Federal agencies or when any future amendment to this part becomes final.

      (b) Existing negotiated indirect cost rates will remain in place until they expire. The effective date of changes to indirect cost rates must be based upon the date a newly re-negotiated rate goes into effect for the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year. Therefore, for indirect cost rates and cost allocation plans, the revisions to this part (as of the publication date for revisions to this guidance) become effective in generating proposals and negotiating a new rate (when the rate is re-negotiated).

      § 200.111   English language.

#### § § 200.111

      (a) All Federal financial assistance announcements, applications, and Federal award information should be in the English language and must be in terms of U.S. dollars. However, Federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients may issue or translate a Federal award or other documents into another language. A Federal agency may translate formal or informal announcements of the availability of Federal funding through a financial assistance program, such as a notice of funding opportunity, when translations may serve to increase the pool of applicants or the participation of a specific community (for example, programs administered in foreign countries where the primary language is not English). Federal agencies must maintain an official controlling English version of the Federal financial assistance announcement and the Federal award, including the terms and conditions.(b) Applications, reports, and official correspondence may be submitted in languages other than English if specified in the notice of funding opportunity or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (c) In the event of inconsistency between English and another language, the English language meaning will control. When a significant portion of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees administering a Federal award are not fluent in English, the Federal award should be provided in English and the language(s) with which employees are more familiar.

      § 200.112   Conflict of interest.

#### § § 200.112

      Federal agencies must establish conflict of interest policies for Federal awards. A recipient or subrecipient must disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to the Federal agency or pass-through entity in accordance with the established Federal agency policies.

      § 200.113   Mandatory disclosures.

#### § § 200.113

      An applicant, recipient, or subrecipient of a Federal award must promptly disclose whenever, in connection with the Federal award (including any activities or subawards thereunder), it has credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733). The disclosure must be made in writing to the Federal agency, the agency's Office of Inspector General, and pass-through entity (if applicable). Recipients and subrecipients are also required to report matters related to recipient integrity and performance in accordance with Appendix XII of this part. Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in § 200.339. (See also 2 CFR part 180, 31 U.S.C. 3321, and 41 U.S.C. 2313.)

    Subpart C—Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards

      § 200.200   Purpose.

#### § § 200.200

      Sections 200.201 through 200.217 prescribe instructions and other pre-award matters to be used by Federal agencies in the program planning, announcement, application, and award processes.

      § 200.201   Use of grants, cooperative agreements, fixed amount awards, and contracts.

#### § § 200.201

      (a)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate type of agreement for a Federal award (for example, a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract) in accordance with this guidance. See the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-6309).

      (b)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity (see § 200.333) may use _fixed amount awards_ (see the definition of  in § 200.1) for which the following conditions apply:

      (1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. See § 200.101(b)(4)(ii) for further information on which provisions in subpart E (cost principles) apply to fixed amount awards. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope has measurable goals and objectives and if accurate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed budget based on a reasonable estimate of actual costs. Budgets for fixed amount awards are negotiated with the recipient or subrecipient and the total amount of Federal funding is determined in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's proposal, available pricing data, and subpart E. Accountability must be based on performance and results, which can be communicated in performance reports or through routine monitoring. There is no expected routine monitoring of the actual costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient under the Federal award. Therefore, no financial reporting is required. This does not absolve the recipient or subrecipient from the record retention requirements contained in §§ 200.334 through 200.338; nor does it absolve the recipient or subrecipient of the responsibilities of making records available for review during an audit. See § 200.101(b)(5)(i). Payments must be based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:

      (i) In several partial payments. The amount of each payment as well as the “milestone” or event triggering the payment, should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award;

      (ii) On a unit price basis. The defined unit(s) or price(s) should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award; or

      (iii) In one payment at the completion of the Federal award.

      (2) A fixed amount award must not be used in programs that require cost sharing.

      (3) A fixed amount award may generate and use program income in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; however, the requirements of § 200.307 do not apply.

      (4) At the end of a fixed amount award, the recipient or subrecipient must certify in writing to the Federal agency or pass-through entity that the project was completed as agreed to in the Federal award, or identify those activities that were not completed, and that all expenditures were incurred in accordance with § 200.403. When the required activities were not carried out, including fixed amount awards paid on a unit price basis under 200.201(b)(1)(ii), the amount of the Federal award must be reduced by the amount that reflects the activities that were not completed in accordance with the Federal award. When the required activities were completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to any unexpended funds.

      (5) Periodic reports may be established for fixed amount awards.

      (6) Prior approval requirements that apply to fixed amount awards are § 200.308(f) (paragraphs 1 through 3, 6 through 8, and 10) and § 200.333.

      § 200.202   Program planning and design.

#### § § 200.202

      (a) The Federal agency must design a program and create an Assistance Listing before announcing the Notice of Funding Opportunity. A program must be designed:

      (1) With clear goals and objectives that provide meaningful results and be consistent with the Federal authorizing legislation of the program;

      (2) To measure performance based on the goals and objectives developed during program planning and design. Performance measures may differ depending on the type of program. See § 200.301 for more information on performance measurement;

      (3) To align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and support the Federal agency's performance measurement, management, customer service initiatives, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11 (Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget);

      (4) To align with the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (Pub. L. 114-264) as well as the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Pub. L. 115-435), as applicable; and

      (5) To encourage applicants to engage, when practicable, during the design phase, members of the community that will benefit from or be impacted by a program.

      (b) Federal agencies should develop programs in consultation with communities benefiting from or impacted by the program. In addition, Federal agencies should consider available data, evidence, and evaluation results from past programs and make every effort to extend eligibility requirements to all potential applicants. Federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate with other agencies during program planning and design, particularly when the goals and objectives of a program or project align with those of other agencies.

      § 200.203   Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs.

#### § § 200.203

      (a) The Federal agency must maintain an accurate list of Federal programs in the Assistance Listings maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) at

      (1) The Assistance Listings is the comprehensive government-wide source of Federal financial assistance program information produced by the executive branch of the Federal Government.

      (2) The information that the Federal agency must submit to GSA for approval by OMB is listed in paragraph (b). GSA must prescribe the format for the submission in coordination with OMB.

      (3) The Federal agency must assign the appropriate Assistance Listing before making the Federal award unless exigent circumstances require otherwise (for example, timing requirements imposed by a Federal statute).

      (b) To the extent practicable, the Federal agency must create, update, and manage Assistance Listing entries based on the authorizing statute for the program and comply with additional guidance provided by GSA (in consultation with OMB) to ensure consistent and accurate information is available to prospective applicants. Assistance Listings should be communicated to the public in plain language. Accordingly, Federal agencies must submit the following information to GSA when creating an Assistance Listing:

      (1)  A brief summary of the statutory or regulatory requirements of the program and its intended outcome. Where appropriate, the program description, purpose, goals, and performance measurement should align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and should support the Federal agency's performance measurement, management, customer experience initiatives, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11;

      (2)  Identification of whether the program will issue Federal awards on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis;

      (3)  Estimates based on previous year funding are acceptable if current appropriations are not available at the time of the submission;

      (4)  The statutory authority for funding the program and the agency, sub-agency, or specific program unit that will issue the Federal awards (to the extent possible) and associated funding identifier (for example, Treasury Account Symbol(s));

      (5)  The statutory, regulatory, or other eligibility factors or considerations that determine the applicant's qualification for Federal awards under the program (for example, type of recipient); and

      (6)  Applicability of Single Audit Requirements as required by subpart F.

      § 200.204   Notices of funding opportunities.

#### § § 200.204

      The Federal agency must announce specific funding opportunities for Federal financial assistance that will be openly competed. The term openly competed means opportunities that are not directed to one or more specifically identified applicants. To the extent possible, the Federal agency should communicate opportunities to the public in plain language to ensure the announcement is accessible to diverse communities of eligible applicants, including underserved communities. The Federal agency should also make efforts to limit the length and complexity of the announcement and only include the information that is necessary for the effective communication of the program objectives. Federal agencies may offer pre-application technical assistance or provide clarifying information for funding opportunities. However, Federal agencies must ensure these resources are made accessible and widely available to all potential applicants (for example, by posting answers to questions and requests on ). The Federal agency should make every effort to identify in the NOFO all eligible applicants (for example, different types of nonprofit organizations such as labor unions and tribal organizations). The following information must be provided in a public notice:

      (a)  The Federal agency must display the following information on  in a location preceding the full text of the announcement:

      (1) Federal Agency Name;

      (2) Funding Opportunity Title;

      (3) Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement or a modification of a previously announced opportunity);

      (4) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if the Federal agency has assigned a number to the funding opportunity announcement);

      (5) Assistance Listing Number(s);

      (6) Funding Details. To the extent appropriate, the total amount of funding that the Federal agency expects to award, the anticipated number of awards, and the expected dollar values of individual awards, which may be a range or average;

      (7) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for submitting applications or Executive Order 12372 submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or preapplications. For any announcement issued before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency should provide an anticipated award date. If the NOFO states that applications will be evaluated on a “rolling” basis (that is, at different points during a specified period of time), the Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision;

      (8) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes the goals and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible applicants. The text of the executive summary should not exceed 500 words; and

      (9) Agency contact information.

      (b)  The Federal agency should make all funding opportunities available for application for at least 60 calendar days. However, the Federal agency may modify the availability period of an opportunity as needed. For example, extending the period may be necessary to provide technical assistance to an applicant pool that was not anticipated when the announcement was made or has less experience with applying for Federal financial assistance. The Federal agency may also determine that an availability period of less than 60 days is sufficient for a particular funding opportunity. However, no funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless the Federal agency determines that exigent circumstances justify this.

      (c)  (1) The Federal agency must include the information in Appendix I for every funding opportunity.

      (2) Federal agencies should ensure that funding opportunities are written using plain language. To the extent possible Federal agencies must streamline opportunities to make them accessible, particularly for funding opportunities that are new, targeted to underserved communities, or intended to reach inexperienced applicants.

      (3) To reduce application burden, Federal agencies should consider whether programmatic or administrative requirements specific to the agency, program, or funding opportunity must be met at the time of application or as a requirement of receiving a Federal award.

      § 200.205   Federal agency review of merit of proposals.

#### § § 200.205

      Unless prohibited by Federal statute, the Federal agency must design and execute a merit review process of applications for discretionary Federal awards. The objective of a merit review process is to select recipients most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives as outlined in section § 200.202. A merit review is an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with the written standards of the Federal agency. These standards should identify the number of people the agency requires to participate in the merit review process and provide opportunities for a diverse group of participants, including those representing underserved communities. The merit review process explained in this section must be described or incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity. See appendix I to this part. See also § 200.204. The Federal agency must also periodically review its merit review process.

      § 200.206   Federal agency review of risk posed by applicants.

#### § § 200.206

      (a)  (1) Prior to making a Federal award, the Federal agency is required to review eligibility information for applicants and financial integrity information for applicants available in OMB-designated databases per the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-117), the “Do Not Pay Initiative” (31 U.S.C. 3354), and 41 U.S.C. 2313.

      (2) The Federal agency is required to review the responsibility and qualification records available in the non-public segment of the System for Award Management () prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined at 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. See 41 U.S.C. 2313. The Federal agency must consider all of the information available in  with regard to the applicant and any immediate highest-level owner, predecessor (meaning, an organization that is replaced by a successor), or subsidiary, identified for that applicant in . See Public Law 112-239, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013; 41 U.S.C. 2313(d). The information in the system for a prior recipient of a Federal award must demonstrate a satisfactory record of administering programs or activities under Federal financial assistance or procurement awards, and integrity and business ethics. The Federal agency may make a Federal award to a recipient that does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the risk associated with the recipient in accordance with § 200.208.

      (b)  (1) The Federal agency must establish and maintain policies and procedures for conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risks posed by applicants before issuing Federal awards. This assessment helps identify risks that may affect the advancement toward or the achievement of a project's goals and objectives. Risk assessments assist Federal managers in determining appropriate resources and time to devote to project oversight and monitor recipient progress. This assessment may incorporate elements such as the quality of the application, award amount, risk associated with the program, cybersecurity risks, fraud risks, and impacts on local jobs and the community. If the Federal agency determines that the Federal award will be made, specific conditions that address the assessed risk may be implemented in the Federal award. The risk criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of the funding opportunity described in § 200.204.

      (2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal agency should consider the following items:

      (i)  The applicant's record of effectively managing financial risks, assets, and resources;

      (ii)  Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;

      (iii)  The applicant's record of managing previous and current Federal awards, including compliance with reporting requirements and conformance to the terms and conditions of Federal awards, if applicable;

      (iv)  Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F or the reports and findings of any other available audits, if applicable; and

      (v)  The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on recipients of Federal awards.

      (c)  The Federal agency may modify the risk assessment at any time during the period of performance, which may justify changes to the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.208.

      (d)  The Federal agency must comply with the government-wide suspension and debarment guidance in 2 CFR part 180 and individual Federal agency suspension and debarment requirements in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal agencies must also require recipients to comply with these requirements. These requirements restrict making Federal awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal awards or participating in Federal awards.

      § 200.207   Standard application requirements.

#### § § 200.207

      (a)  The Federal agency may only use application information collections approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 and in alignment with OMB-approved, government-wide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead. Examples of application information collections approved by OMB include the Standard Forms 424 (SF-424), which is available on , and the Biographical Sketch Common Form (OMB Control Number 3145-0279), which Federal agencies should use to collect biographical sketches and other disclosure information from award applicants. OMB will authorize additional information collections only on a limited basis and consistent with these requirements.

      (b)  The Federal agency may inform applicants that they do not need to provide certain information already being collected through other means.

      § 200.208   Specific conditions.

#### § § 200.208

      (a) Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award conditions and performance expectations are consistent with the program design (See § 200.202 and § 200.301).

      (b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific conditions in the Federal award based on an analysis of the following factors:

      (1) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data (for example, ) or review of its risk assessment (See § 200.206);

      (2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and conditions of Federal awards;

      (3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as described in § 200.211; or

      (4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate financial capability to perform the Federal award.

      (c) Specific conditions may include the following:

      (1) Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments;

      (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance;

      (3) Requiring additional or more detailed financial reports;

      (4) Requiring additional project monitoring;

      (5) Requiring the recipient or subrecipient to obtain technical or management assistance; or

      (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.

      (d) Prior to imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must notify the recipient or subrecipient as to:

      (1) The nature of the specific condition(s);

      (2) The reason why the specific condition(s) is being imposed;

      (3) The nature of the action needed to remove the specific condition(s);

      (4) The time allowed for completing the actions; and

      (5) The method for requesting the Federal agency or pass-through entity to reconsider imposing a specific condition.

      (e) Any specific conditions must be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been satisfied.

      § 200.209   Certifications and representations.

#### § § 200.209

      Unless prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, or regulations, a Federal agency or pass-through entity is authorized to require a recipient to submit annual certifications and representations. Submission may be required more frequently if a recipient or subrecipient fails to meet a requirement of a Federal award. When a recipient is provided an exception to the requirements of 2 CFR 25.110, the recipient must submit the appropriate assurance form (for example, SF-424B).

      § 200.210   Pre-award costs.

#### § § 200.210

      For requirements on costs incurred by the applicant prior to the start date of the period of performance of the Federal award, see § 200.458.

      § 200.211   Information contained in a Federal award.

#### § § 200.211

      The Federal award must include the following information:

      (a)  Where applicable, performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline data must be included in the Federal award. The Federal agency must also specify in the terms and conditions of the Federal award how performance will be assessed, including the timing and scope of expected performance. See §§ 200.202 and 200.301 for more information on _Federal award performance goals._

      (b)  The Federal agency must include the following information in each Federal award:

      (1) Recipient Name (which must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier as defined at 2 CFR 25.400);

      (2) Recipient's Unique Entity Identifier;

      (3) Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);

      (4) Federal Award Date (see Federal award date in § 200.1);

      (5) Period of Performance Start and End Date;

      (6) Budget Period Start and End Date;

      (7) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this Action;

      (8) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated;

      (9) Total Approved Cost Sharing, where applicable;

      (10) Total Amount of the Federal Award including approved Cost Sharing;

      (11) Budget Approved by the Federal Agency;

      (12) Federal Award Description (to comply with statutory requirements (for example, FFATA));

      (13) Name of the Federal agency (including contact information for the awarding official);

      (14) Assistance Listings Number and Title;

      (15) Identification of whether the Award is R&D; and

      (16) Indirect Cost Rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged per § 200.414).

      (c)  (1) Federal agencies must incorporate the following general terms and conditions either in the Federal award or by reference, as applicable:

      (i)  Administrative requirements implemented by the Federal agency as specified in this part.

      (ii)  These include statutory, executive order, other Presidential directive, or regulatory requirements that apply by specific reference and are not program-specific. See § 200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements.

      (iii)  When the total Federal share of the Federal award may include more than $500,000 over the period of performance, the Federal agency must include the terms and conditions available in Appendix XII. See also § 200.113.

      (iv)  When it is anticipated that the period of performance will include multiple budget periods, the Federal agency must indicate that subsequent budget periods are subject to the availability of funds, program authority, satisfactory performance, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (v)  Federal agencies must inform recipients of the termination provisions in § 200.340, including the applicable termination provisions in the Federal agency's regulations or terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (2) The Federal award must incorporate, by reference, all general terms and conditions of the Federal award, which must be maintained on the Federal agency's website.

      (3) The Federal agency must provide a copy of the full text of the general terms and conditions if a recipient requests it.

      (4) The Federal agency must maintain an archive of previous versions of the general terms and conditions, with effective dates, for use by a recipient, auditors, or others. The archive should be located on the Federal agency's website in the same place where current terms and conditions are available.

      (d)  The Federal agency must include in each Federal award any specific terms and conditions that are in addition to the general terms and conditions. See also § 200.208. For loan and loan guarantee programs, the Federal agency must specify whether or not the Federal award has continuing compliance requirements. Whenever practicable, these specific terms and conditions should also be available on the Federal agency's website and in notices of funding opportunities (as outlined in § 200.204).

      (e)  Any other information required by the Federal agency.

      § 200.212   Public access to Federal award information.

#### § § 200.212

      (a) Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the Federal agency must publish the required Federal award information on  in accordance with the guidance provided by OMB and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Government-wide Spending Data Model (GSDM).

      (b) All responsibility and qualification records posted in  will be publicly available after a waiting period of 14 calendar days, except for:

      (1) Past performance reviews required by Federal Government contractors (See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR part 42, subpart 42.15);

      (2) Information that was entered prior to April 15, 2011; or

      (3) Information that is withdrawn during the 14-calendar day waiting period by a Federal agency.

      (c) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring the publication of information otherwise exempt under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556.

      § 200.213   Reporting a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award.

#### § § 200.213

      (a) The Federal agency must report in  if it does not make a Federal award to an applicant because it determines that the applicant does not meet the minimum qualification standards as described in § 200.206(a)(2). The Federal agency must report that determination only if all of the following apply:

      (1) The only basis for the determination is the applicant's prior record of performance on administering Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in § 200.206(a)(2) (meaning, the applicant was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards); and

      (2) The total Federal share of the Federal award was expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.

      (b) The Federal agency is not required to report a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award if they issue the Federal award in accordance with the requirements of § 200.208.

      (c) If the Federal agency reports a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award, the Federal agency also must notify the applicant that:

      (1) The determination was made and reported in . The notification from the Federal agency to the applicant should also provide a brief explanation for the determination;

      (2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination and then archived (See section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended, codified at 41 U.S.C. 2313);

      (3) Each Federal agency that considers making a Federal award to the applicant during that five-year period will consider that information in determining the applicant's qualification to receive a Federal award when the total Federal share of a Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;

      (4) The applicant may review the responsibility and qualification records accessible in  and comment on any information the system contains about the applicant; and

      (5) Federal agencies must consider the applicant's comments in determining whether the applicant is qualified for a future Federal award.

      (d) If the Federal agency enters information into  about a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently:

      (1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the information in the system within three business days; and

      (2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the Federal agency should amend the information in the system within 30 days.

      (e) Federal agencies must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of the responsibility and qualification records that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If a recipient asserts within seven calendar days to a Federal agency that some or all of the publicly available information is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.

      § 200.214   Suspension and debarment.

#### § § 200.214

      Recipients and subrecipients are subject to the nonprocurement debarment and suspension regulations implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, as well as 2 CFR part 180. The regulations in 2 CFR part 180 restrict making Federal awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from receiving or participating in Federal awards.

      § 200.215   Never contract with the enemy.

#### § § 200.215

      Federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients are subject to the guidance implementing Never Contract with the Enemy in 2 CFR part 183. The guidance in 2 CFR part 183 affects covered contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that are expected to exceed $50,000 during the period of performance, are performed outside the United States and its territories, and are in support of a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities.

      § 200.216   Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment or services.

#### § § 200.216

      (a) Recipients and subrecipients are prohibited from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to:

      (1) Procure or obtain covered telecommunications equipment or services;

      (2) Extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain covered telecommunications equipment or services; or

      (3) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain covered telecommunications equipment or services.

      (b) As described in section 889 of Public Law 115-232, “covered telecommunications equipment or services” means any of the following:

      (1) Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities);

      (2) For the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities);

      (3) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or using such equipment;

      (4) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country;

      (c) For the purposes of this section, “covered telecommunications equipment or services” also include systems that use covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system.

      (d) In implementing the prohibition under section 889 of Public Law 115-232, heads of executive agencies administering loan, grant, or subsidy programs must prioritize available funding and technical support to assist affected businesses, institutions, and organizations as is reasonably necessary for those affected entities to transition from covered telecommunications equipment or services, to procure replacement equipment or services, and to ensure that communications service to users and customers is sustained.

      (e) When the recipient or subrecipient accepts a loan or grant, it is certifying that it will comply with the prohibition on covered telecommunications equipment and services in this section. The recipient or subrecipient is not required to certify that funds will not be expended on covered telecommunications equipment or services beyond the certification provided upon accepting the loan or grant and those provided upon submitting payment requests and financial reports.

      (f) For additional information, see section 889 of Public Law 115-232 and § 200.471.

      § 200.217   Whistleblower protections.

#### § § 200.217

      An employee of a recipient or subrecipient must not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described in paragraph (a)(2) of 41 U.S.C. 4712 information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant. The recipient and subrecipient must inform their employees in writing of employee whistleblower rights and protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712. See statutory requirements for whistleblower protections at 10 U.S.C. 4701, 41 U.S.C. 4712, 41 U.S.C. 4304, and 10 U.S.C. 4310.

    Subpart D—Post Federal Award Requirements

      Property Standards

        § 200.310   Insurance coverage.

#### § § 200.310

        The recipient or subrecipient must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with Federal funds as provided to property and equipment owned by the recipient or subrecipient. Insurance is not required for Federally owned property unless required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        § 200.311   Real property.

#### § § 200.311

        (a)  Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or improved under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient.

        (b)  Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or the Federal agency, real property must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as it is needed for that purpose. While the property is being used for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests except as provided by the Federal agency. Easements for utility, cable, and similar services that benefit the real property and are consistent with the authorized use are not considered an encumbrance.

        (c)  When an appraisal of real property is required and obtained by the recipient or subrecipient, it must be conducted by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”

        (d)  When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The instructions must specify one of the following disposition methods:

        (1)  When the recipient or subrecipient retains title to the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property. However, in situations where the recipient or subrecipient is disposing of real property acquired or improved with the Federal award and acquiring replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.

        (2)  When a recipient or subrecipient sells the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) by the proceeds of the sale after deducting any actual and reasonable expenses paid to sell or fix up the property for sale. When the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When directed to sell the property, the recipient or subrecipient must sell the property utilizing procedures that provide for competition to the extent practicable and that result in the highest possible return.

        (3)  When a recipient or subrecipient transfers title to the property to a Federal agency or third party designated or approved by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to be paid an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution towards the original purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property.

        § 200.312   Federally owned and exempt property.

#### § § 200.312

        (a) Title to Federally owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. The recipient or subrecipient must submit an inventory listing of Federally owned property in its custody to the Federal agency or pass-through entity on an annual basis. The recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity upon completion of the Federal award or when the property is no longer needed.

        (b) If the Federal agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority unless the Federal agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods ( the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)). The Federal agency or pass-through entity must issue appropriate instructions to the recipient or subrecipient.

        (c) Exempt property means property acquired under the Federal award where the Federal agency has chosen to vest title to the property to the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government. The Federal agency may only exercise this option when permitted by Federal statute and set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Absent statutory authority and specific terms and conditions of the Federal award, the title to exempt property acquired under the Federal award remains with the Federal Government.

        § 200.313   Equipment.

#### § § 200.313

        See also § 200.439.

        (a)  Title to equipment acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient subject to the conditions of this section. This title must be a conditional title unless a Federal statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government (and the Federal agency elects to do so). A conditional title means a clear title is withheld by the Federal agency until conditions and requirements specified in the terms and conditions of a Federal award have been fulfilled. Title for equipment vested in a recipient or subrecipient is subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.

        (2) While the equipment is being used for the originally-authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section.

        (b)  A State must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures. Indian Tribes must use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with tribal laws and procedures. If such laws and procedures do not exist, Indian Tribes must follow the guidance in this section. Other recipients and subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

        (c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must use equipment for the project or program for which it was acquired and for as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award. The recipient or subrecipient must not encumber the equipment without prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The Federal agency may require the submission of the applicable common forms for reporting on equipment. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the equipment may be used in other activities in the following order of priority:

        (i) Activities under other Federal awards from the Federal agency that funded the original program or project; then

        (ii) Activities under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. These activities include consolidated equipment for information technology systems.

        (2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient or subrecipient must also make the equipment available for use on other programs or projects supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use of the equipment must be given to other programs or projects supported by the Federal agency that financed the equipment. Second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. Use for non-federally-funded projects is also permissible, provided such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. The recipient or subrecipient should consider charging user fees as appropriate.

        (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 200.307 to earn program income, the recipient or subrecipient must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would charge for similar services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

        (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient or subrecipient may either trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement equipment.

        (d)  Regardless of whether equipment is acquired in part or its entirety under the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient must manage equipment (including replacement equipment) utilizing procedures that meet the following requirements:

        (1) Property records must include a description of the property, a serial number or another identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), the title holder, the acquisition date, the cost of the property, the percentage of the Federal agency contribution towards the original purchase, the location, use and condition of the property, and any disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property. The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for maintaining and updating property records when there is a change in the status of the property.

        (2) A physical inventory of the property must be conducted, and the results must be reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

        (3) A control system must be in place to ensure safeguards for preventing property loss, damage, or theft. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment must be investigated. The recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity of any loss, damage, or theft of equipment that will have an impact on the program.

        (4) Regular maintenance procedures must be in place to ensure the property is in proper working condition.

        (5) If the recipient or subrecipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be in place to ensure the highest possible return.

        (e)  When equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project, program, or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with Federal agency or pass-through entity disposition instructions:

        (1) Equipment with a current fair market value of $10,000 or less (per unit) may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (2) Except as provided in § 200.312(b), or if the Federal agency or pass-through entity fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current fair market value in excess of $10,000 (per-unit) may be retained or sold by the recipient or subrecipient. However, the Federal agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase by the current market value or proceeds from the sale. If the equipment is sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses associated with the selling and handling of the equipment.

        (3) The recipient or subrecipient may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that the recipient or subrecipient must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

        (4) In cases where a recipient or subrecipient fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may direct the recipient or subrecipient to take disposition actions.

        (f)  When included in the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency may permit the recipient to retain equipment, or authorize a pass-through entity to permit the subrecipient to retain equipment, with no further obligation to the Federal Government unless prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.

        § 200.314   Supplies.

#### § § 200.314

        See also § 200.453.

        (a) Title to supplies acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient. When there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $10,000 in aggregate value at the end of the period of performance, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may retain or sell the unused supplies. Unused supplies means supplies that are in new condition, not having been used or opened before. The aggregate value of unused supplies consists of all supply types, not just like-item supplies. The Federal agency or pass-through entity is entitled to compensation in an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's contribution towards the cost of the original purchase(s) by the current market value or proceeds from the sale. If the supplies are sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses associated with the selling and handling of the supplies.

        (b) Unless expressly authorized by Federal statute, the recipient or subrecipient must not use supplies acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would charge for similar services. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies or as authorized by Federal statute.

        § 200.315   Intangible property.

#### § § 200.315

        (a) Title to intangible property acquired under a Federal award vests upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient. The recipient or subrecipient must use that intangible property for the originally authorized purpose and must not encumber the property without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property must occur in accordance with the provisions in § 200.313(e).

        (b) To the extent permitted by law, the recipient or subrecipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The Federal agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so. This includes the right to require recipients and subrecipients to make such works available through agency-designated public access repositories.

        (c) The recipient or subrecipient is subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations in 37 CFR part 401.

        (d) The Federal Government has the right to:

        (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under a Federal award; and

        (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data for Federal purposes.

        (e)(1) The recipient or subrecipient must provide research data relating to published research findings produced under the Federal award and that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law if requested by the Federal agency in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. When the Federal agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the Federal agency may charge the requester a fee for the cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect the costs incurred by the Federal agency and the recipient or subrecipient. This fee is in addition to any fees the Federal agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).

        (2) Published research findings mean:

        (i) Research findings published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or

        (ii) Research findings publicly cited by a Federal agency in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law.

        (3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings. Research data does not include any of the following:

        (i) Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (for example, laboratory samples).

        (ii) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and

        (iii) Personnel, medical, and other personally identifiable information that, if disclosed, would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. Information that could identify a particular person in a research study is not considered research data.

        (f) Federal agencies should work with recipients to maximize public access to Federally funded research results and data in a manner that protects data providers' confidentiality, privacy, and security. Agencies should provide guidance to recipients to make restricted-access data available through a variety of mechanisms. FOIA may not be the most appropriate mechanism for providing access to intangible property, including Federally funded research results and data.

        § 200.316   Property trust relationship.

#### § § 200.316

        Real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved with the Federal award must be held in trust by the recipient or subrecipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with a Federal award and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

      Procurement Standards

        § 200.317   Procurements by States and Indian Tribes.

#### § § 200.317

        When conducting procurement transactions under a Federal award, a State or Indian Tribe must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements with non-Federal funds. If such policies and procedures do not exist, States and Indian Tribes must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.318 through 200.327. In addition to its own policies and procedures, a State or Indian Tribe must also comply with the following procurement standards: §§ 200.321, 200.322, 200.323, and 200.327. All other recipients and subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.318 through 200.327.

        § 200.318   General procurement standards.

#### § § 200.318

        (a)  The recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procedures for procurement transactions under a Federal award or subaward, including for acquisition of property or services. These documented procurement procedures must be consistent with State, local, and tribal laws and regulations and the standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.

        (b)  Recipients and subrecipients must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders. See also § 200.501(h).

        (c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, agent, or board member with a real or apparent conflict of interest may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by the Federal award. A conflict of interest includes when the employee, officer, agent, or board member, any member of their immediate family, their partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from an entity considered for a contract. An employee, officer, agent, and board member of the recipient or subrecipient may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors. However, the recipient or subrecipient may set standards for situations where the financial interest is not substantial or a gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The recipient's or subrecipient's standards of conduct must also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations by its employees, officers, agents, or board members.

        (2) If the recipient or subrecipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, local government, or Indian Tribe, the recipient or subrecipient must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest mean that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.

        (d)  The recipient's or subrecipient's procedures must avoid the acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. When appropriate, an analysis should be made between leasing and purchasing property or equipment to determine the most economical approach.

        (e)  When appropriate for the procurement or use of common or shared goods and services, recipients and subrecipients are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements for procurement transactions. These or similar procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing may foster greater economy and efficiency. Documented procurement actions of this type (using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements) will meet the competition requirements of this part.

        (f)  The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use excess and surplus Federal property instead of purchasing new equipment and property when it is feasible and reduces project costs.

        (g)  When practical, the recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering means analyzing each contract item or task to ensure its essential function is provided at the overall lowest cost.

        (h)  The recipient or subrecipient must award contracts only to responsible contractors that possess the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed contract. The recipient or subrecipient must consider contractor integrity, public policy compliance, proper classification of employees (see the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201, chapter 8), past performance record, and financial and technical resources when conducting a procurement transaction. See also § 200.214.

        (i)  The recipient or subrecipient must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of each procurement transaction. These records must include the rationale for the procurement method, contract type selection, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

        (j)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a recipient or subrecipient is the sum of:

        (i) The actual cost of materials; and

        (ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.

        (2) Because this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the recipient or subrecipient awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.

        (k)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of its procurement transactions. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the recipient or subrecipient of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Federal agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the recipient or subrecipient unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. The recipient or subrecipient must report violations of law to the Federal, State, or local authority with proper jurisdiction.

        (l)  (1) The procurement standards in this subpart do not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from:

        (i) Using Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) or similar forms of pre-hire collective bargaining agreements;

        (ii) Requiring construction contractors to use hiring preferences or goals for people residing in high-poverty areas, disadvantaged communities as defined by the Justice40 Initiative (see OMB Memorandum M-21-28), or high-unemployment census tracts within a region no smaller than the county where a federally funded construction project is located. The hiring preferences or goals should be consistent with the policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient, and must not prohibit interstate hiring;

        (iii) Requiring a contractor to use hiring preferences or goals for individuals with barriers to employment (as defined in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102(24)), including women and people from underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 14091;

        (iv) Using agreements intended to ensure uninterrupted delivery of services; using agreements intended to ensure community benefits; or

        (v) Offering employees of a predecessor contractor rights of first refusal under a new contract.

        (2) Recipients and subrecipients may use the practices listed in paragraph (1) if consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, the objectives and purposes of the applicable Federal financial assistance program, and other requirements of this part.

        § 200.319   Competition.

#### § § 200.319

        (a) All procurement transactions under the Federal award must be conducted in a manner that provides full and open competition and is consistent with the standards of this section and § 200.320.

        (b) To ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids must be excluded from competing on those procurements.

        (c) Examples of situations that may restrict competition include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms for them to qualify to do business;

        (2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;

        (3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;

        (4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;

        (5) Organizational conflicts of interest;

        (6) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and

        (7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.

        (d) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:

        (1) Are made in accordance with § 200.319(b);

        (2) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the property, equipment, or service being procured. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the property, equipment, or service to be procured. When necessary, the description must provide minimum essential characteristics and standards to which the property, equipment, or service must conform. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to clearly and accurately describe the technical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description of features may be used to provide procurement requirements. The specific features of the named brand must be clearly stated; and

        (3) Identify any additional requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors that will be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

        (e) The recipient or subrecipient must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products used in procurement transactions are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open competition. When establishing or amending prequalified lists, the recipient or subrecipient must consider objective factors that evaluate price and cost to maximize competition. The recipient or subrecipient must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.

        (f) To the extent consistent with established practices and legal requirements applicable to the recipient or subrecipient, this subpart does not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from developing written procedures for procurement transactions that incorporate a scoring mechanism that rewards bidders that commit to specific numbers and types of U.S. jobs, minimum compensation, benefits, on-the-job-training for employees making work products or providing services on a contract, and other worker protections. This subpart also does not prohibit recipients and subrecipients from making inquiries of bidders about these subjects and assessing the responses. Any scoring mechanism must be consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (g) Noncompetitive procurements can only be awarded in accordance with § 200.320(c).

        § 200.320   Procurement methods.

#### § § 200.320

        There are three types of procurement methods described in this section: informal procurement methods (for micro-purchases and simplified acquisitions); formal procurement methods (through sealed bids or proposals); and noncompetitive procurement methods. For any of these methods, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with the standards of this section and §§ 200.317, 200.318, and 200.319.

        (a)  These procurement methods expedite the completion of transactions, minimize administrative burdens, and reduce costs. Informal procurement methods may be used when the value of the procurement transaction under the Federal award does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in § 200.1. Recipients and subrecipients may also establish a lower threshold. Informal procurement methods include:

        (1) —(i)  The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold defined in § 200.1. To the extent practicable, the recipient or subrecipient should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.

        (ii)  Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the recipient or subrecipient considers the price reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history, or other information; and maintains documents to support its conclusion. Purchase cards may be used as a method of payment for micro-purchases.

        (iii)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold used by the recipient or subrecipient must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations. The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section.

        (iv)  The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to be made available to the Federal agency or pass-through entity and auditors in accordance with § 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following:

        (A) A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in § 200.520 for the most recent audit;

        (B) An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or,

        (C) For public institutions, a higher threshold is consistent with State law.

        (v)  Micro-purchase thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must submit a request that includes the requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. The increased threshold is valid until any factor that was relied on in the establishment and rationale of the threshold changes.

        (2) —(i)  The aggregate dollar amount of the procurement transaction is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If simplified acquisition procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate.

        (ii)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures, which may be lower than, but must not exceed, the threshold established in the FAR.

        (b)  Formal procurement methods are required when the value of the procurement transaction under a Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold of the recipient or subrecipient. Formal procurement methods are competitive and require public notice. The following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement transactions above the simplified acquisition threshold determined by the recipient or subrecipient in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section:

        (1)  This is a procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited through an invitation and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation and is the lowest in price. The sealed bids procurement method is preferred for procuring construction services.

        (i) For sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:

        (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; (B) Two or more responsible bidders have been identified as willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and

        (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm-fixed-price contract, and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally based on price.

        (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:

        (A) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them with sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate. For local governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised.

        (B) The invitation for bids must define the items or services with specific information, including any required specifications, for the bidder to properly respond;

        (C) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids. For local governments, the bids must be opened publicly.

        (D) A firm-fixed-price contract is awarded in writing to the lowest responsive bid and responsible bidder. When specified in the invitation for bids, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life-cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is the lowest. Payment discounts must only be used to determine the low bid when the recipient or subrecipient determines they are a valid factor based on prior experience.

        (E) The recipient or subrecipient must document and provide a justification for all bids it rejects.

        (2)  This is a procurement method used when conditions are not appropriate for using sealed bids. This procurement method may result in either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement contract. They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements:

        (i) Requests for proposals require public notice, and all evaluation factors and their relative importance must be identified. Proposals must be solicited from multiple qualified entities. To the maximum extent practicable, any proposals submitted in response to the public notice must be considered.

        (ii) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for conducting technical evaluations and making selections.

        (iii) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the recipient or subrecipient considering price and other factors; and

        (iv) The recipient or subrecipient may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby the offeror's qualifications are evaluated, and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where the price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used to procure architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services. The method may not be used to purchase other services provided by A/E firms that are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.

        (c)  There are specific circumstances in which the recipient or subrecipient may use a noncompetitive procurement method. The noncompetitive procurement method may only be used if one of the following circumstances applies:

        (1) The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);

        (2) The procurement transaction can only be fulfilled by a single source;

        (3) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from providing public notice of a competitive solicitation;

        (4) The recipient or subrecipient requests in writing to use a noncompetitive procurement method, and the Federal agency or pass-through entity provides written approval; or

        (5) After soliciting several sources, competition is determined inadequate.

        § 200.321   Contracting with small businesses, minority businesses, women's business enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms.

#### § § 200.321

        (a) When possible, the recipient or subrecipient should ensure that small businesses, minority businesses, women's business enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms (See U.S. Department of Labor's list) are considered as set forth below.

        (b) Such consideration means:

        (1) These business types are included on solicitation lists;

        (2) These business types are solicited whenever they are deemed eligible as potential sources;

        (3) Dividing procurement transactions into separate procurements to permit maximum participation by these business types;

        (4) Establishing delivery schedules (for example, the percentage of an order to be delivered by a given date of each month) that encourage participation by these business types;

        (5) Utilizing organizations such as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

        (6) Requiring a contractor under a Federal award to apply this section to subcontracts.

        § 200.322   Domestic preferences for procurements.

#### § § 200.322

        (a) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, provide a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States (including but not limited to iron, aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The requirements of this section must be included in all subawards, contracts, and purchase orders under Federal awards.

        (b) For purposes of this section:

        (1) “Produced in the United States” means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States.

        (2) “Manufactured products” means items and construction materials composed in whole or in part of non-ferrous metals such as aluminum; plastics and polymer-based products such as polyvinyl chloride pipe; aggregates such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber.

        (c) Federal agencies providing Federal financial assistance for infrastructure projects must implement the Buy America preferences set forth in 2 CFR part 184.

        § 200.323   Procurement of recovered materials.

#### § § 200.323

        (a) A recipient or subrecipient that is a State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State and its contractors must comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962. The requirements of Section 6002 include procuring only items designated in the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines.

        (b) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, purchase, acquire, or use products and services that can be reused, refurbished, or recycled; contain recycled content, are biobased, or are energy and water efficient; and are sustainable. This may include purchasing compostable items and other products and services that reduce the use of single-use plastic products. See Executive Order 14057, section 101, Policy.

        § 200.324   Contract cost and price.

#### § § 200.324

        (a) The recipient or subrecipient must perform a cost or price analysis for every procurement transaction, including contract modifications, in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. The method and degree of analysis conducted depend on the facts surrounding the particular procurement transaction. For example, the recipient or subrecipient should consider potential workforce impacts in their analysis if the procurement transaction will displace public sector employees. However, as a starting point, the recipient or subrecipient must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.

        (b) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the extent that the costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the recipient or subrecipient under subpart E of this part. The recipient or subrecipient may reference its own cost principles as long as they comply with subpart E of this part.

        (c) The recipient or subrecipient must not use the “cost plus a percentage of cost” and “percentage of construction costs” methods of contracting.

        § 200.325   Federal agency or pass-through entity review.

#### § § 200.325

        (a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may review the technical specifications of proposed procurements under the Federal award if the Federal agency or pass-through entity believes the review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. The recipient or subrecipient must submit the technical specifications of proposed procurements when requested by the Federal agency or pass-through entity. This review should take place prior to the time the specifications are incorporated into a solicitation document. When the recipient or subrecipient desires to accomplish the review after a solicitation has been developed, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications. In those cases, the review should be limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

        (b) When requested, the recipient or subrecipient must provide procurement documents (such as requests for proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) to the Federal agency or pass-through entity for pre-procurement review. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct a pre-procurement review when:

        (1) The recipient's or subrecipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;

        (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition, or only one bid is expected to be received in response to a solicitation;

        (3) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and specifies a “brand name” product;

        (4) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and a sealed bid procurement is to be awarded to an entity other than the apparent low bidder; or

        (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (c) The recipient or subrecipient is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.

        (1) The recipient or subrecipient may request that the Federal agency or pass-through entity review its procurement system to determine whether it meets these standards for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding and third-party contracts are awarded regularly.

        (2) The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify its procurement system. However, self-certification does not limit the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's right to review the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may rely on written assurances from the recipient or subrecipient that it is complying with the standards of this part. The recipient or subrecipient must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as complying with these requirements and have its system available for review.

        § 200.326   Bonding requirements.

#### § § 200.326

        The Federal agency or pass-through entity may accept the recipient's or subrecipient's bonding policy and requirements for construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Before doing so, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must determine that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:

        (a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The bid guarantee must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute any required contractual documents within the specified timeframe.

        (b) A performance bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A performance bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to secure the fulfillment of all the contractor's requirements under a contract.

        (c) A payment bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A payment bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by the law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for under a contract.

        § 200.327   Contract provisions.

#### § § 200.327

        The recipient's or subrecipient's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described in Appendix II of this part.

      Performance and Financial Monitoring and Reporting

        § 200.328   Financial reporting.

#### § § 200.328

        (a) The Federal agency must require only OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient financial reports. At the time of publication, this consists of the Federal Financial Report (SF-425); however, this also applies to any future OMB-approved government-wide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead.

        (b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must collect financial reports no less than annually. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect financial reports more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with § 200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should collect financial reports in coordination with performance reports.

        (c) The recipient or subrecipient must submit financial reports as required by the Federal award. Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period.

        (d) The final financial report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final financial report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also § 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any financial report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.

        § 200.329   Monitoring and reporting program performance.

#### § § 200.329

        (a)  The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the oversight of the Federal award. The recipient and subrecipient must monitor their activities under Federal awards to ensure they are compliant with all requirements and meeting performance expectations. Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient must cover each program, function, or activity. See also § 200.332.

        (b)  The Federal agency must use OMB-approved common information collections (for example, Research Performance Progress Reports) when requesting performance reporting information. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect performance reports more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with § 200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should align the due dates of performance reports and financial reports. When reporting program performance, the recipient or subrecipient must relate financial data and project or program accomplishments to the performance goals and objectives of the Federal award. Also, the recipient or subrecipient must provide cost information to demonstrate cost-effective practices (for example, through unit cost data) when required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports. Reporting requirements must clearly indicate a standard against which the recipient's or subrecipient's performance can be measured. Reporting requirements should not solicit information from the recipient or subrecipient that is not necessary for the effective monitoring or evaluation of the Federal award. Federal agencies should consult monitoring framework documents such as the agency's Evaluation Plan to make that determination. As noted in OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 280, measures of customer experience are of co-equal importance as traditional measures of financial and operational performance.

        (c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must submit performance reports as required by the Federal award. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except if specific conditions are applied (See § 200.208). Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year Federal awards. The final performance report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final performance report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also § 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any performance report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.

        (2) As applicable, performance reports should contain information on the following:

        (i) A comparison of accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the reporting period (for example, comparing costs to units of accomplishment). Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the Federal agency program, the Federal agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.

        (ii) Explanations on why established goals or objectives were not met; and

        (iii) Additional information, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or higher-than-expected unit costs.

        (d)  Federal agencies or pass-through entities rely on on-site technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under Federal awards for construction. Therefore, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require additional performance reports when necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of Federal awards are met.

        (e)  When a significant development that could impact the Federal award occurs between performance reporting due dates, the recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Significant developments include events that enable meeting milestones and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or that produce different beneficial results than originally planned. Significant developments also include problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will impact the recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet milestones or the objectives of the Federal award. When significant developments occur that negatively impact the Federal Award, the recipient or subrecipient must include information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

        (f)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct in-person or virtual site visits as warranted.

        (g)  The Federal agency may waive any performance report that is not necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of the Federal award are being achieved.

        § 200.330   Reporting on real property.

#### § § 200.330

        The Federal agency or pass-through entity must require the recipient or subrecipient to submit reports on the status of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest. Such reports must be submitted at least annually. In instances where the Federal Government's interest in the real property extends for 15 years or more, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to report at various multi-year frequencies. Reports submitted at multi-year frequencies may not exceed a five-year reporting period. The Federal agency must only require OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient real property reports.

      Subrecipient Monitoring and Management

        § 200.331   Subrecipient and contractor determinations.

#### § § 200.331

        An entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. The pass-through entity is responsible for making case-by-case determinations to determine whether the entity receiving Federal funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal agency may require the pass-through entity to comply with additional guidance to make these determinations, provided such guidance does not conflict with this section. The Federal agency does not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients or contractors of any tier; however, the Federal agency is responsible for monitoring the pass-through entity's oversight of first-tier subrecipients. All of the characteristics listed below may not be present in all cases, and some characteristics from both categories may be present at the same time. No single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. The pass-through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract. In making this determination, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement.

        (a)  A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the Federal award and creates a Federal financial assistance relationship with a subrecipient. See the definition of  in § 200.1. Characteristics that support the classification of the entity as a subrecipient include, but are not limited to, when the entity:

        (1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;

        (2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether the objectives of a Federal program were met;

        (3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision-making;

        (4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and

        (5) Implements a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.

        (b)  A _contract_ is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient's or subrecipient's use and creates a procurement relationship with a contractor. See the definition of  in § 200.1. Characteristics that support a procurement relationship between the recipient or subrecipient and a contractor include, but are not limited to, when the contractor:

        (1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;

        (2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;

        (3) Normally operates in a competitive environment;

        (4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the implementation of a Federal program; and

        (5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of a Federal program as a result of the agreement. However, similar requirements may apply for other reasons.

        § 200.332   Requirements for pass-through entities.

#### § § 200.332

        A pass-through entity must:

        (a) Verify that the subrecipient is not excluded or disqualified in accordance with § 180.300. Verification methods are provided in § 180.300, which include confirming in  that a potential subrecipient is not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal funds.

        (b) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the information provided below. A pass-through entity must provide the best available information when some of the information below is unavailable. A pass-through entity must provide the unavailable information when it is obtained. Required information includes:

        (1) Federal award identification.

        (i) Subrecipient's name (must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier);

        (ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier;

        (iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);

        (iv) Federal Award Date;

        (v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date;

        (vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date;

        (vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated in the subaward;

        (viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity, including the current financial obligation;

        (ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity;

        (x) Federal award project description, as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA);

        (xi) Name of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and contact information for awarding official of the pass-through entity;

        (xii) Assistance Listings title and number; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at the time of disbursement;

        (xiii) Identification of whether the Federal award is for research and development; and

        (xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is used in accordance with § 200.414).

        (2) All requirements of the subaward, including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;

        (3) Any additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient for the pass-through entity to meet its responsibilities under the Federal award. This includes information and certifications (see § 200.415) required for submitting financial and performance reports that the pass-through entity must provide to the Federal agency;

        (4) Indirect cost rate:

        (i) An approved indirect cost rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal Government. If no approved rate exists, a pass-through entity must determine the appropriate rate in collaboration with the subrecipient. The indirect cost rate may be either:

        (A) An indirect cost rate negotiated between the pass-through entity and the subrecipient. These rates may be based on a prior negotiated rate between a different pass-through entity and the subrecipient, in which case the pass-through entity is not required to collect information justifying the rate but may elect to do so; or

        (B) The de minimis indirect cost rate.

        (ii) The pass-through entity must not require the use of the de minimis indirect cost rate if the subrecipient has an approved indirect cost rate negotiated with the Federal Government. Subrecipients may elect to use the cost allocation method to account for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.405(d).

        (5) A requirement that the subrecipient permit the pass-through entity and auditors to access the subrecipient's records and financial statements for the pass-through entity to fulfill its monitoring requirements; and

        (6) Appropriate terms and conditions concerning the closeout of the subaward.

        (c) Evaluate each subrecipient's fraud risk and risk of noncompliance with a subaward to determine the appropriate subrecipient monitoring described in paragraph (f) of this section. When evaluating a subrecipient's risk, a pass-through entity should consider the following:

        (1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;

        (2) The results of previous audits. This includes considering whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in accordance with subpart F and the extent to which the same or similar subawards have been audited as a major program;

        (3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and

        (4) The extent and results of any Federal agency monitoring (for example, if the subrecipient also receives Federal awards directly from the Federal agency).

        (d) If appropriate, consider implementing specific conditions in a subaward as described in § 200.208 and notify the Federal agency of the specific conditions.

        (e) Monitor the activities of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. The pass-through entity is responsible for monitoring the overall performance of a subrecipient to ensure that the goals and objectives of the subaward are achieved. In monitoring a subrecipient, a pass-through entity must:

        (1) Review financial and performance reports.

        (2) Ensure that the subrecipient takes corrective action on all significant developments that negatively affect the subaward. Significant developments include Single Audit findings related to the subaward, other audit findings, site visits, and written notifications from a subrecipient of adverse conditions which will impact their ability to meet the milestones or the objectives of a subaward. When significant developments negatively impact the subaward, a subrecipient must provide the pass-through entity with information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

        (3) Issue a management decision for audit findings pertaining only to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by § 200.521.

        (4) Resolve audit findings specifically related to the subaward. However, the pass-through entity is not responsible for resolving cross-cutting audit findings that apply to the subaward and other Federal awards or subawards. If a subrecipient has a current Single Audit report and has not been excluded from receiving Federal funding (meaning, has not been debarred or suspended), the pass-through entity may rely on the subrecipient's cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit to perform audit follow-up and make management decisions related to cross-cutting audit findings in accordance with section § 200.513(a)(4)(viii). Such reliance does not eliminate the responsibility of the pass-through entity to issue subawards that conform to agency and award-specific requirements, to manage risk through ongoing subaward monitoring, and to monitor the status of the findings that are specifically related to the subaward.

        (f) Depending upon the pass-through entity's assessment of the risk posed by the subrecipient (as described in paragraph (c) of this section), the following monitoring tools may be useful for the pass-through entity to ensure proper accountability and compliance with program requirements and achievement of performance goals:

        (1) Providing subrecipients with training and technical assistance on program-related matters;

        (2) Performing site visits to review the subrecipient's program operations; and

        (3) Arranging for agreed-upon-procedures engagements as described in § 200.425.

        (g) Verify that a subrecipient is audited as required by subpart F of this part.

        (h) Consider whether the results of a subrecipient's audit, site visits, or other monitoring necessitate adjustments to the pass-through entity's records.

        (i) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in § 200.339 and in program regulations.

        § 200.333   Fixed amount subawards.

#### § § 200.333

        With prior written approval from the Federal agency, the recipient may provide subawards based on fixed amounts up to $500,000. Fixed amount subawards must meet the requirements of § 200.201.

      Record Retention and Access

        § 200.334   Record retention requirements.

#### § § 200.334

        The recipient and subrecipient must retain all Federal award records for three years from the date of submission of their final financial report. For awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, the recipient and subrecipient must retain records for three years from the date of submission of their quarterly or annual financial report, respectively. Records to be retained include but are not limited to, financial records, supporting documentation, and statistical records. Federal agencies or pass-through entities may not impose any other record retention requirements except for the following:

        (a) The records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken if any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the three-year period.

        (b) When the recipient or subrecipient is notified in writing by the Federal agency or pass-through entity, cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend the retention period.

        (c) The records for property and equipment acquired with the support of Federal funds must be retained for three years after final disposition.

        (d) The three-year retention requirement does not apply to the recipient or subrecipient when records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency.

        (e) The records for program income earned after the period of performance must be retained for three years from the end of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which the program income is earned. This only applies if the Federal agency or pass-through entity requires the recipient or subrecipient to report on program income earned after the period of performance in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (f) The records for indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates) must be retained according to the applicable option below:

        (1)  When a proposal, plan, or other computation must be submitted to the Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other standard rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of submission.

        (2)  When a proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other standard rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

        § 200.335   Requests for transfer of records.

#### § § 200.335

        The Federal agency must request the transfer of records to its custody from the recipient or subrecipient when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. However, the Federal agency may arrange for the recipient or subrecipient to retain the records that have long-term retention value so long as they are continuously available to the Federal Government.

        § 200.336   Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information.

#### § § 200.336

        When practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient must collect, transmit, and store Federal award information in open and machine-readable formats. A machine-readable format is a format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a computer system. Upon request, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must always provide or accept paper versions of Federal award information to and from the recipient or subrecipient. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require additional copies of Federal award information submitted in paper versions. The recipient or subrecipient does not need to create and retain paper copies when original records are electronic and cannot be altered. In addition, the recipient or subrecipient may substitute electronic versions of original paper records through duplication or other forms of electronic conversion, provided that the procedures are subject to periodic quality control reviews. Quality control reviews must ensure that electronic conversion procedures provide safeguards against the alteration of records and assurance that records remain in a format that is readable by a computer system.

        § 200.337   Access to records.

#### § § 200.337

        (a)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity, Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives must have the right of access to any records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to the Federal award to perform audits, execute site visits, or for any other official use. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to the recipient's or subrecipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents or the Federal award in general.

        (b)  The recipient or subrecipient and Federal agency or pass-through entity must take measures to protect the name of victims of a crime when access to the victim's name is necessary. Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include a review of the true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. Any such access, other than under a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head or delegate of the Federal agency.

        (c)  The Federal agency's or pass-through entity's rights of access are not limited to the required retention period of this part but last as long as the records are retained. Federal agencies or pass-through entities must not impose any other access requirements upon recipients and subrecipients.

        § 200.338   Restrictions on public access to records.

#### § § 200.338

        Federal agencies may not place restrictions on the recipient or subrecipient that limit public access to the records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to a Federal award, except for protected personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information when the Federal agency can demonstrate that such records will be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the Federal agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not apply to records that remain under the recipient's or subrecipient's control except as required by § 200.315. Unless required by Federal, State, local, or tribal law, recipients and subrecipients are not required to permit public access to their records. The recipient's or subrecipient's records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA and applicable exemptions.

      Remedies for Noncompliance

        § 200.339   Remedies for noncompliance.

#### § § 200.339

        The Federal agency or pass-through entity may implement specific conditions if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.208 for additional information on specific conditions. When the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may take one or more of the following actions:

        (a) Temporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective action.

        (b) Disallow costs for all or part of the activity associated with the noncompliance of the recipient or subrecipient.

        (c) Suspend or terminate the Federal award in part or in its entirety.

        (d) Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized in 2 CFR part 180 and the Federal agency's regulations, or for pass-through entities, recommend suspension or debarment proceedings be initiated by the Federal agency.

        (e) Withhold further Federal funds (new awards or continuation funding) for the project or program.

        (f) Pursue other legally available remedies.

        § 200.340   Termination.

#### § § 200.340

        (a) The Federal award may be terminated in part or its entirety as follows:

        (1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award;

        (2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the recipient or subrecipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions. These conditions include the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated;

        (3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal agency or pass-through entity a written notification of the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that the remaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for which the Federal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or

        (4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.

        (b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (c) When the Federal agency terminates the Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency must report the termination in . A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter information in .

        (1) The information required under paragraph (c) of this section is not to be reported in  until the recipient has either:

        (i) Exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision (see § 200.342); or

        (ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal agency that it intends to appeal the decision to terminate.

        (2) If a Federal agency, after entering information about a termination in , subsequently:

        (i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the information in the system within three business days;

        (ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the Federal agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.

        (3) The Federal agency must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of  that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). When the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal agency which posted the information that a disclosure exemption under FOIA covers some of the information made publicly available, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Before reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's FOIA procedures.

        (d) When the Federal award is terminated in part or its entirety, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and recipient or subrecipient remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in §§ 200.344 and 200.345.

        § 200.341   Notification of termination requirement.

#### § § 200.341

        (a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must provide written notice of termination to the recipient or subrecipient. The written notice of termination should include the reasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.

        (b) If the Federal award is terminated for the recipient's material failure to comply with a Federal award, the notification must state the following:

        (1) The termination decision will be reported in ;

        (2) The information will be available in  for five years from the date of the termination and then archived;

        (3) Federal agencies that consider making a Federal award to the recipient during the five year period must consider this information in judging whether the recipient is qualified to receive the Federal award when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;

        (4) The recipient may comment on any information in  about the recipient for future consideration by Federal agencies. The recipient may submit comments in .

        (5) Federal agencies should consider the recipient's comments when determining whether the recipient is qualified for a Federal award.

        (c) Upon termination of the Federal award, the Federal agency must provide the information required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) to  In addition, the Federal agency must update or notify any other relevant government-wide systems or entities of any indications of poor performance as required by 41 U.S.C. 2313 and 31 U.S.C. 3321.

        § 200.342   Opportunities to object, hearings, and appeals.

#### § § 200.342

        The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and appeals. Upon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or termination), the Federal agency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any requirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

        § 200.343   Effects of suspension and termination.

#### § § 200.343

        Costs to the recipient or subrecipient resulting from financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient during a suspension or after the termination of a Federal award are not allowable unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. However, costs during suspension or after termination are allowable if:

        (a) The costs result from financial obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient or subrecipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, and not in anticipation of it; and

        (b) The costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired normally at the end of the period of performance in which the termination takes effect.

      Closeout

        § 200.344   Closeout.

#### § § 200.344

        (a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must close out the Federal award when it determines that all administrative actions and required work of the Federal award have been completed. When the recipient or subrecipient fails to complete the necessary administrative actions or the required work for an award, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must proceed with closeout based on the information available. This section specifies the administrative actions required at the end of the period of performance.

        (b) A recipient must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by the Federal award) no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by a subaward) to the pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient. When the recipient does not have a final indirect cost rate covering the period of performance, a final financial report must still be submitted to fulfill the requirements of this section. The recipient must submit a revised final financial report when all applicable indirect cost rates have been finalized.

        (c) The recipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under the Federal award no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under a subaward no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient.

        (d) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not delay payments to the recipient or subrecipient for costs meeting the requirements of subpart E of this part.

        (e) The recipient or subrecipient must promptly refund any unobligated funds that the Federal agency or pass-through entity paid and that are not authorized to be retained. See OMB Circular A-129 and § 200.346.

        (f) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must make all necessary adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received (for example, to reflect the disallowance of any costs or the deobligation of an unliquidated balance).

        (g) The recipient or subrecipient must account for any property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.330.

        (h) The Federal agency must make every effort to complete all closeout actions no later than one year after the end of the period of performance. If the indirect cost rate has not been finalized and would delay closeout, the Federal agency is authorized to mutually agree with the recipient to close an award using the current or most recently negotiated rate. However, the recipient is not required to agree to a final rate for a Federal award for the purpose of prompt closeout.

        (i) If the recipient does not comply with the requirements of this section, including submitting all final reports, the Federal agency must report the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award in . A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter or amend information in . Federal agencies may also pursue other enforcement actions as appropriate. See § 200.339.

      Post-Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities

        § 200.345   Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

#### § § 200.345

        (a) The closeout of the Federal award does not affect any of the following:

        (1) The right of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or review. However, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make determinations to disallow costs and notify the recipient or subrecipient within the record retention period.

        (2) The recipient's or subrecipient's requirement to return funds or right to receive any remaining and available funds as a result of refunds, corrections, final indirect cost rate adjustments (unless the Federal award in closed in accordance with § 200.344(h)), or other transactions.

        (3) The ability of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to make financial adjustments to a previously closed Federal award, such as resolving indirect cost payments and making final payments.

        (4) Audit requirements in subpart F of this part.

        (5) Property management and disposition requirements in §§ 200.310 through 200.316.

        (6) Records retention as required in §§ 200.334 through 200.337.

        (b) After the closeout of the Federal award, a relationship created under the Federal award may be modified or ended in whole or in part. This may only be done with the consent of the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient or subrecipient referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions are made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient or subrecipient, as appropriate.

      Collection of Amounts Due

        § 200.346   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 200.346

        Any Federal funds paid to the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the amount that the recipient or subrecipient is determined to be entitled to under the Federal award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. The Federal agency must collect all debts arising out of its Federal awards in accordance with the Standards for the Administrative Collection of Claims (31 CFR part 901).

      § 200.300   Statutory and national policy requirements.

#### § § 200.300

      (a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations—including provisions protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, and the environment, and those prohibiting discrimination—and the requirements of this part. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must communicate to a recipient or subrecipient all relevant requirements, including those contained in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (b) In administering Federal awards that are subject to a Federal statute prohibiting discrimination based on sex, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must ensure that the award is administered in a way that does not unlawfully discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity if the statute's prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity consistent with the Supreme Court's reasoning in  v.  140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).

      (c) In administering awards in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, the Federal agency must take account of the heightened constitutional scrutiny that may apply under the Constitution's Equal Protection guarantee for government action that provides differential treatment based on protected characteristics.

      § 200.301   Performance measurement.

#### § § 200.301

      (a) The Federal agency must measure the recipient's performance to show achievement of program goals and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster the adoption of promising practices. The Federal agency should establish program goals and objectives during program planning and design (see § 200.202). The Federal agency should clearly communicate the specific program goals and objectives in the Federal award, including how the Federal agency will measure the achievement of the goals and objectives, the expected timeline, and information on how the recipient must report the achievement of program goals and objectives. The Federal agency should also clearly communicate in the Federal award any expected outcomes (such as outputs, service performance, or public impacts of any of these), indicators, targets, baseline data, or data collections that the recipient is responsible for measuring and reporting. The Federal agency must ensure all requirements for measuring performance align with the Federal agency's strategic goals, strategic objectives, or performance goals relevant to a program (see OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget Part 6).

      (b) When establishing performance reporting frequency and content, the Federal agency should consider what information will be necessary to measure the recipient's progress, to identify promising practices of recipients, and build the evidence upon which the Federal agency makes program and performance decisions. The Federal agency should not require additional information that is not necessary for measuring program performance and evaluation. See § 200.329 for more information on reporting program performance.

      (c) The Federal agency should also specify in the Federal award any requirements of the recipients' participation in federally funded evaluations.

      § 200.302   Financial management.

#### § § 200.302

      (a) Each State must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the State's funds. All recipient and subrecipient financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by the terms and conditions; and tracking expenditures to establish that funds have been used in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.450.

      (b) The recipient's and subrecipient's financial management system must provide for the following (see §§ 200.334, 200.335, 200.336, and 200.337):

      (1) Identification of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number, year the Federal award was issued, and name of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

      (2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements in §§ 200.328 and 200.329. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient or subrecipient that maintains its records other than on an accrual basis, the recipient or subrecipient must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient or subrecipient may develop accrual data for its reports based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.

      (3) Maintaining records that sufficiently identify the amount, source, and expenditure of Federal funds for Federal awards. These records must contain information necessary to identify Federal awards, authorizations, financial obligations, unobligated balances, as well as assets, expenditures, income, and interest. All records must be supported by source documentation.

      (4) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and assets. The recipient or subrecipient must safeguard all assets and ensure they are used solely for authorized purposes. See § 200.303.

      (5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award.

      (6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of § 200.305.

      (7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      § 200.303   Internal controls.

#### § § 200.303

      The recipient and subrecipient must:

      (a) Establish, document, and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the recipient or subrecipient is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls should align with the guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

      (b) Comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (c) Evaluate and monitor the recipient's or subrecipient's compliance with statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

      (d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified.

      (e) Take reasonable cybersecurity and other measures to safeguard information including protected personally identifiable information (PII) and other types of information. This also includes information the Federal agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or other information the recipient or subrecipient considers sensitive and is consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and responsibility over confidentiality.

      § 200.304   Bonds.

#### § § 200.304

      (a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal agency may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

      (b) The Federal agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks coverage to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

      (c) Where bonds, insurance, or both are required in the situations described above, the bonds and insurance must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury (see 31 CFR part 223).

      § 200.305   Federal payment.

#### § § 200.305

      (a)  Payments for States are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 4A-2000, “Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.”

      (b)  For recipients and subrecipients other than States, payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Federal agency or the pass-through entity and the disbursement of funds by the recipient or subrecipient regardless of whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer or by other means. See § 200.302(b)(6). Except as noted in this part, the Federal agency must require recipients to use only OMB-approved, government-wide information collections to request payment.

      (1) The recipient or subrecipient must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient or subrecipient, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a recipient or subrecipient must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed with actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient or subrecipient in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must make timely payments to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.

      (2) Whenever possible, advance payment requests by the recipient or subrecipient must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards received by the recipient from the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity.

      (i) Advance payment mechanisms must comply with 31 CFR part 208 and include, but are not limited to, Treasury checks and electronic funds transfers.

      (ii) Recipients and subrecipients must be authorized to submit payment requests as often as necessary when electronic fund transfers are used or at least monthly when electronic transfers are not used. See Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

      (3) Reimbursement is preferred when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the Federal agency or pass-through entity sets a specific condition per § 200.208, when requested by the recipient or subrecipient, when a Federal award is for construction, or when a significant portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.

      (4) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient or subrecipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the recipient or subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally aligned to the recipient's or subrecipient's disbursing cycle. After that, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the recipient or subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance payment method requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The pass-through entity must not use the working capital advance method of payment if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

      (5) If available, the recipient or subrecipient must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on Federal funds before requesting additional cash payments.

      (6) Payments for allowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or in one of the following instances:

      (i) The recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; or

      (ii) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.” Under such conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may, after providing reasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient or subrecipient for financial obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the debt is repaid to the Federal Government.

      (7) A payment withheld for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award must be released to the recipient or subrecipient upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments must be made in accordance with § 200.343.

      (8) A payment must not be made to a recipient or subrecipient for amounts that the recipient or subrecipient withholds from contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payment must be made when the recipient or subrecipient disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of work.

      (9) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to the recipient or subrecipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories. However, the recipient or subrecipient must be able to account for all Federal funds received, obligated, and expended.

      (10) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

      (11) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing accounts unless one of the following applies:

      (i) The recipient or subrecipient receives less than $250,000 in Federal funding per year;

      (ii) The best available interest-bearing account would not reasonably be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances;

      (iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible with the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources;

      (iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts; or

      (v) An interest-bearing account is not readily accessible (for example, due to public or political unrest in a foreign country).

      (12) The recipient or subrecipient may retain up to $500 per year of interest earned on Federal funds to use for administrative expenses of the recipient or subrecipient. Any additional interest earned on Federal funds must be returned annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. All interest in excess of $500 per year must be returned to PMS regardless of whether the recipient or subrecipient was paid through PMS. Instructions for returning interest can be found at

      (13) All other Federal funds must be returned to the payment system of the Federal agency. Returns should follow the instructions provided by the Federal agency. All returns to PMS should follow the instructions provided at

      § 200.306   Cost sharing.

#### § § 200.306

      (a) Voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected under Federal research grants. The Federal agency may not use voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals for Federal research grants unless authorized by Federal statutes or agency regulations and specified in the notice of funding opportunity. Federal agencies are also discouraged from using voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications for other Federal financial assistance programs. If voluntary committed cost sharing is used for this purpose for other programs, the notice of funding opportunity must specify how an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered. See §§ 200.414, 200.204, and Appendix I.

      (b) For all Federal awards, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must accept any cost sharing funds (including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, and also including funds committed by the recipient, subrecipient, or third parties) as part of the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to a program when the funds:

      (1) Are verifiable in the recipient's or subrecipient's records;

      (2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;

      (3) Are necessary and reasonable for achieving the objectives of the Federal award;

      (4) Are allowable under subpart E;

      (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the program's Federal authorizing statute specifically provides that Federal funds made available for the program can be applied to cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;

      (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal agency; and

      (7) Conform to other applicable provisions of this part.

      (c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing, may be included as part of cost sharing with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the recipient's or subrecipient's approved indirect cost rate.

      (d) Values for recipient or subrecipient contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity authorizes the recipient or subrecipient to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing must be the lesser of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) below.

      (1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting records at the time of donation.

      (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal agency or pass-through may approve using the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) at the time of donation.

      (e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other labor may be counted as cost sharing if the service is necessary for the program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the recipient or subrecipient. When the required skills are not found in the recipient's or subrecipient's workforce, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market where the recipient or subrecipient competes for the services involved. In either case, fringe benefits that are allowable, allocable, and reasonable may be included in the valuation.

      (f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 200.414(d) provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.

      (g) Donated property from third parties may include items such as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. The assessed value of donated property included as cost sharing must not exceed the property's fair market value at the time of the donation.

      (h) The method used for determining the value of donated equipment, buildings, and land for which title passes to the recipient or subrecipient may differ according to the following:

      (1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the recipient or subrecipient in acquiring equipment, buildings, or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing.

      (2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed if provided in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.420.

      (i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the accounting policies of the recipient or subrecipient with the following qualifications:

      (1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient or subrecipient as established by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”

      (2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value at the time of donation.

      (3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

      (4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.

      (j) The fair market value of third-party in-kind contributions must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used internally by the recipient or subrecipient.

      (k) For institutions of higher education (IHE), voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should be treated differently from mandatory or voluntary committed cost sharing. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should not be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing includes faculty-donated additional time above that agreed to as part of the award. See OMB memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, Clarification of OMB A-21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.

      § 200.307   Program income.

#### § § 200.307

      (a)  The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to earn income to defray program costs when appropriate. Program income must be used for the original purpose of the Federal award. Program income earned during the period of performance may only be used for costs incurred during the period of performance or allowable closeout costs. See § 200.472(b). Program income must be expended prior to requesting additional Federal funds. Program income exceeding amounts specified in the Federal award may be added to or deducted from the total allowable costs in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (b)  There are three methods of applying program income: deduction; addition; and cost-sharing. The Federal agency should specify what program income method(s) will be used in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The deduction method will be used if the Federal agency does not specify a method for applying program income. When no program income method is specified in the Federal award, prior approval is required to use the addition or cost sharing methods. However, the addition method will be used when no method is specified for awards made to institutions of higher education (IHE) and nonprofit research institutions. In specifying alternatives to the deduction and addition methods, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients as well as between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income.

      (1)  Program income is deducted from the total allowable costs, reducing the overall total amount of the Federal award.

      (2)  Program income is added to the total allowable costs, increasing the overall total amount of the Federal award.

      (3)  Program income is used to meet the Federal award's cost sharing requirement.

      (c)  There are no requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Federal award unless stipulated in the Federal agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the end of the period of performance as part of the closeout process. See § 200.344.

      (d)  If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to generating program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.

      (e)  The following are not considered program income unless specified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award:

      (1)  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues the recipient or subrecipient raised.

      (2)  Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies. The proceeds must be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards of §§ 200.311, 200.313, 200.314, or as explicitly identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

      (3)  License fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under the Federal award subject to 37 CFR part 401.

      § 200.308   Revision of budget and program plans.

#### § § 200.308

      (a)  The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include the Federal share and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

      (b)  The recipient or subrecipient must report deviations from the approved budget, project or program scope, or objective(s) in accordance with § 200.329. The recipient or subrecipient must request prior approvals from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for budget and program plan revisions in accordance with this section.

      (c)  When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient or subrecipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in their application, except if the Federal agency has approved an alternative format. Alternative formats may include the use of electronic systems, email, or other agency-approved mechanisms that document the request.

      (d)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the request for budget or program plan revision and should notify the recipient or subrecipient whether the revisions have been approved within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must inform the recipient or subrecipient in writing when a decision can be expected if more than 30 days is required for a review.

      (e)  Unless specified in this guidance, the Federal agency must not impose additional prior approval requirements without OMB approval. See also §§ 200.102 and 200.407.

      (f)  A recipient or subrecipient must request prior written approval from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for the following program and budget-related reasons:

      (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

      (2) Change in key personnel (including employees and contractors) that are identified by name or position in the Federal award.

      (3) The disengagement from a project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time and effort devoted to the Federal award over the course of the period of performance, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

      (4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E as applicable.

      (5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other budget categories.

      (6) Subaward activities not proposed in the application and approved in the Federal award. A change of subrecipient only requires prior approval if the Federal agency or pass-through entity includes the requirement in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In general, a Federal agency or pass-through entity should not require prior approval of a change of subrecipient unless the inclusion was a determining factor in the merit review or eligibility process. This requirement does not apply to procurement transactions for goods and services.

      (7) Changes in the total approved cost-sharing amount.

      (8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.

      (9) Transferring funds between the construction and non-construction work under a Federal award.

      (10) A no-cost extension (meaning, an extension of time that does not require the obligation of additional Federal funds) of the period of performance, other than any one-time extension authorized by the Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (g)(2). All requests for no-cost extensions should be submitted at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. The Federal agency may approve multiple no-cost extensions under a Federal award if not prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.

      (g)  Except for the requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10), the Federal agency is authorized to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approval requirements contained in subparts D and E. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do one or more of the following:

      (1)  Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal award date. Expenses incurred more than 90 calendar days before the Federal award date require prior approval of the Federal agency. All costs incurred before the Federal award date are at the recipient's own risk ( the Federal agency is not required to reimburse such costs if the recipient does not receive the Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). Pre-award costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. See also § 200.458.

      (2)  Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. Prior approval is not required if a recipient is authorized in the terms and conditions of the Federal award to initiate a one-time extension. However, the recipient must notify the Federal agency in writing with the supporting justification and a revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. A one-time extension may not be exercised for the sole purpose of using unobligated balances. This paragraph does not preclude the Federal agency from approving further no-cost extensions to the Federal award. One-time extensions require prior approval from the Federal agency when:

      (i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension;

      (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds; or

      (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved scope of the project.

      (3)  Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods.

      (h)  The prior approval requirements for the actions described in paragraph (g) of this section are automatically waived for Federal awards that support research unless stipulated in the Federal agency's regulations or terms and conditions of the Federal award. However, one-time extensions require the Federal agency's prior approval when one of the conditions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies.

      (i)  The Federal agency must not permit a transfer of funds that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation. The Federal agency may also, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories (for example, personnel, travel, and supplies) or programs, functions, and activities when:

      (1) The Federal share of the Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold; and

      (2) The cumulative amount of a transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget, including cost share, as last approved by the Federal agency.

      § 200.309   Modifications to Period of Performance.

#### § § 200.309

      When the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves an extension to a Federal award, or if a recipient extends under § 200.308(g)(2), the period of performance will be amended to end at the completion of the extension. If termination occurs, the period of performance will be amended to end upon the effective date of termination. The start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of performance.

    Subpart E—Cost Principles

      General Provisions

        § 200.400   Policy guide.

#### § § 200.400

        The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental premises that:

        (a) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Federal award through sound management practices.

        (b) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (c) The recipient and subrecipient, in recognition of their unique combination of staff, facilities, and experience, are responsible for employing organization and management techniques necessary to ensure the proper and efficient administration of the Federal award.

        (d) The accounting practices of the recipient and subrecipient must be consistent with these cost principles and support the accumulation of costs as required by these cost principles, including maintaining adequate documentation to support costs charged to the Federal award.

        (e) When reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for _indirect costs_ should ensure that the recipient consistently applies these cost principles. Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a given cost item by the recipient, the reasonableness and equity of such treatments should be fully considered. See the definition of  in § 200.1.

        (f) For recipients and subrecipients that educate and engage students in research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of these principles.

        (g) The recipient or subrecipient must not earn or keep any profit resulting from Federal financial assistance unless explicitly authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.307. When the required activities of a fixed amount award were completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award, the unexpended funds retained by the recipient or subrecipient are not considered profit.

        § 200.401   Application.

#### § § 200.401

        (a)  The recipient and subrecipient must apply these principles in determining allowable costs under Federal awards. The recipient and subrecipient must also use these principles as a guide in pricing fixed-price contracts and subcontracts when costs are used in determining the appropriate price. These cost principles do not apply to:

        (1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on items such as education allowance or published tuition rates and fees.

        (2) Capitation awards based on case counts or the number of beneficiaries.

        (3) Fixed amount awards, except as provided in § 200.101(b). See also § 200.201.

        (4) Federal awards to hospitals (see Appendix IX of this part).

        (5) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements.

        (6) Other awards under which the recipient or subrecipient is not required to account for actual costs incurred.

        (b)  A Federal contract awarded to a recipient is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). It must incorporate the applicable CAS requirements per 48 CFR Chapter 99 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30). With respect to the allocation of costs, the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 CFR parts 9904 or 9905 take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E. When a contract with a recipient is subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (for example, CAS 414—48 CFR 9904.414—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital, and CAS 417—48 CFR 9904.417—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction, apply instead of the allowability provisions of § 200.449). For example, the allowability of costs in CAS-covered contracts is determined first by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards rather than the allowability provisions in § 200.449 (unless the CAS does not address the specific costs). In complying with those requirements, the recipient's application of cost accounting practices for estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs for Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts must be consistent with 48 CFR. The recipient only needs to maintain one set of accounting records supporting the allocation of costs if the recipient administers both Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts.

        (c)  Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be considered to be similar to for-profit organizations in terms of the applicability of cost principles. These nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles that apply to for-profit organizations located at 48 CFR 31.2. Appendix VIII contains a list of these nonprofit organizations. Other organizations may be added to this list if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

      Basic Considerations

        § 200.402   Composition of costs.

#### § § 200.402

        The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs minus any applicable credits

        § 200.403   Factors affecting allowability of costs.

#### § § 200.403

        Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs must meet the following criteria to be allowable under Federal awards:

        (a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.

        (b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to types or amount of cost items.

        (c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally financed and other activities of the recipient or subrecipient.

        (d) Be accorded consistent treatment. For example, a cost must not be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost.

        (e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for State and local governments and Indian Tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part.

        (f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a prior period. See § 200.306(b).

        (g) Be adequately documented. See §§ 200.300 through 200.309.

        (h) Administrative closeout costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. All other costs must be incurred during the approved budget period. At its discretion, the Federal agency is authorized to waive prior written approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods. See § 200.308(g)(3).

        § 200.404   Reasonable costs.

#### § § 200.404

        A cost is reasonable if it does not exceed an amount that a prudent person would incur under the circumstances prevailing when the decision was made to incur the cost. In determining the reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to the following:

        (a) Whether the cost is generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the recipient's or subrecipient's operation or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award;

        (b) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound business practices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, State, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the Federal award;

        (c) Market prices for comparable costs for the geographic area;

        (d) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their responsibilities to the recipient or subrecipient, its employees, its students or membership (if applicable), the public at large, and the Federal Government; and

        (e) Whether the cost represents a deviation from the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies and procedures for incurring costs.

        § 200.405   Allocable costs.

#### § § 200.405

        (a)  A cost is allocable to a Federal award or other cost objective if the cost is assignable to that Federal award or other cost objective in accordance with the relative benefits received. This standard is met if the cost satisfies any of the following criteria:

        (1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;

        (2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; or

        (3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the recipient or subrecipient and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with these cost principles.

        (b)  All activities which benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the recipient or subrecipient or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs.

        (c)  A cost allocable to a particular Federal award may not be charged to other Federal awards (for example, to overcome fund deficiencies or to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards). However, this prohibition would not preclude the recipient or subrecipient from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.

        (d)  If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit However, when those proportions cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c), the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved, when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.439.

        (e)  If a contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to that contract according to the Cost Accounting Standards, which take precedence over the allocation provisions in this part.

        § 200.406   Applicable credits.

#### § § 200.406

        (a) Applicable credits refer to transactions that offset or reduce direct or indirect costs allocable to a Federal award. Examples of such transactions are purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate.

        (b) In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance activities or service operations of the recipient or subrecipient should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items (including any amounts used to meet cost sharing requirements) must be recognized in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to the Federal award. See §§ 200.436 and 200.468 for potential application areas.

        § 200.407   Prior written approval (prior approval).

#### § § 200.407

        The reasonableness and allocability of certain costs under Federal awards may be difficult to determine. To avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, the recipient may seek the prior written approval of the Federal agency (or, for indirect costs, the cognizant agency for indirect costs) before incurring the cost. The absence of prior written approval on any element of cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness or allocability of that cost unless prior approval is specifically required for allowability as described under certain circumstances in the following sections:

        (a) Section 200.306 Cost sharing;

        (b) Section 200.307 Program income;

        (c) Section 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans;

        (d) Section 200.333 Fixed amount subawards;

        (e) Section 200.430 Compensation—personal services, paragraph (h);

        (f) Section 200.431 Compensation—fringe benefits;

        (g) Section 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures;

        (h) Section 200.440 Exchange rates;

        (i) Section 200.441 Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements;

        (j) Section 200.442 Fund raising and investment management costs;

        (k) Section 200.445 Goods or services for personal use;

        (l) Section 200.447 Insurance and indemnification;

        (m) Section 200.455 Organization costs;

        (n) Section 200.458 Pre-award costs;

        (o) Section 200.462 Rearrangement and reconversion costs;

        (p) Section 200.475 Travel costs.

        § 200.408   Limitation on allowance of costs.

#### § § 200.408

        Statutory requirements may limit the allowability of costs. Any costs that exceed the maximum amount allowed by statute may not be charged to the Federal award. Only the amount allowable by statute may be charged to the Federal award.

        § 200.409   Special considerations.

#### § § 200.409

        Other sections in this part describe special considerations and requirements applicable to states, local governments, Indian Tribes, and IHEs. In addition, certain provisions among the items of cost in this subpart are only applicable to certain types of recipients and subrecipients, as specified in the following sections:

        (a) Direct and Indirect Costs (§§ 200.412-200.415);

        (b) Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes (§§ 200.416 and 200.417); and

        (c) Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education (§§ 200.418 and 200.419).

        § 200.410   Collection of unallowable costs.

#### § § 200.410

        Payments made for costs determined to be unallowable by either the awarding Federal agency, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity must be refunded with interest to the Federal Government. Unless directed by Federal statute or regulation, repayments must be made in accordance with the instructions provided by the Federal agency or pass-through entity that made the allowability determination. See §§ 200.300 through 200.309, and § 200.346.

        § 200.411   Adjustment of previously negotiated indirect cost rates containing unallowable costs.

#### § § 200.411

        (a) Negotiated indirect cost rates based on a proposal later found to have included costs that:

        (1) Are unallowable as specified by Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award; or

        (2) Are unallowable because they are not allocable to the Federal award(s), must be adjusted, or a refund must be made in accordance with the requirements of this section. These adjustments or refunds are intended to correct the proposals used to establish the rates and do not constitute a reopening of the rate negotiation. The adjustments or refunds must be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).

        (b) For rates covering a future fiscal year of the recipient or subrecipient, the unallowable costs must be removed from the indirect cost pools and the rates must be adjusted.

        (c) For rates covering a past period, the Federal share of the unallowable costs must be computed for each year involved, and a cash refund (including interest) must be made to the Federal Government in accordance with the directions provided by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. When cash refunds are made for past periods covered by provisional or fixed rates, appropriate adjustments must be made when the rates are finalized to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs.

        (d) For rates covering the current period, either a rate adjustment or a refund, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, must be required by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The choice of method must be at the discretion of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, based on its judgment as to which method would be most practical.

        (e) The amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in each year's rate will be assumed to be the same as the amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in the base year proposal used to establish the rate.

      Direct and Indirect Costs

        § 200.412   Classification of costs.

#### § § 200.412

        There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as direct or indirect costs. A cost may be direct for some specific service or function but indirect for the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, each cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect cost to avoid possible double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect costs charged to Federal awards are provided in this subpart.

        § 200.413   Direct costs.

#### § § 200.413

        (a)  Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as direct or indirect costs. See § 200.405.

        (b)  The association of costs with a Federal award determines whether costs are direct or indirect. Costs charged directly to a Federal award are typically incurred specifically for that Federal award (including, for example, supplies needed to achieve the award's objectives and the proportion of employee compensation and fringe benefits expended in relation to that specific award). Costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct costs if they are directly related to a specific award (including, for example, extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities, cybersecurity, integrated data systems, asset management systems, performance management costs, program evaluation costs, or other institutional service operations).

        (c)  Administrative and clerical staff salaries should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if they meet all of the following conditions:

        (1) The administrative or clerical services are integral to a Federal award;

        (2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with a Federal award; and

        (3) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.

        (d)  A direct cost of a minor amount may be treated as an indirect cost, for reasons of practicality, provided that it is treated consistently for all Federal and non-Federal purposes.

        (e)  The costs of certain activities are not allowable as charges to Federal awards. Even though these costs are unallowable, they must be treated as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs if they represent activities which:

        (1) Include the salaries of personnel;

        (2) Occupy space; and

        (3) Benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs.

        (f)  For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities performed by the nonprofit organization primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public when significant and necessary to the organization's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect costs. Some examples of these types of activities include:

        (1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See § 200.454.

        (2) Providing services and information to members, the government, or the public. See §§ 200.454 and 200.450.

        (3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See §§ 200.421 and 200.450.

        (4) Conferences (except those held to conduct the general administration of the recipient or subrecipient). See also § 200.432.

        (5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in the recipient's or subrecipient's operation. See also § 200.442.

        (6) Administration of group benefits on behalf of members or clients, including life and hospital insurance, annuity or retirement plans, and financial aid. See also § 200.431.

        § 200.414   Indirect costs.

#### § § 200.414

        (a)  For major Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and major nonprofit organizations, indirect costs must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration.” “Facilities” is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. “Administration” is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the director's office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of “Facilities” (including cross allocations from other pools, where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the “Administration” category; for IHEs, they are included in the “Facilities” category. Major IHEs are defined as those required to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in Appendix III. Major nonprofit organizations are those which receive more than $10 million in direct Federal funding.

        (b)  It is not always possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect costs for nonprofit organizations due to the diversity of their accounting practices. The association of a cost with a Federal award is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs. However, typical examples of indirect cost for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.

        (c)  (See § 200.306.)

        (1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies. A Federal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations. The recipient or subrecipient may notify OMB of any disputes with Federal agencies regarding the application of a federally negotiated indirect cost rate.

        (3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.

        (4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved under paragraph (e). As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants before posting a notice of funding opportunity. See § 200.204.

        (d)  Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in § 200.332(b)(4) and must accept all federally negotiated indirect costs rates for subrecipients.

        (e)  Requirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in the following Appendices:

        (1) Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);

        (2) Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;

        (3) Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;

        (4) Appendix VI to Part 200—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;

        (5) Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and

        (6) Appendix IX to Part 200—Hospital Cost Principles.

        (f)  Recipients and subrecipients that do not have a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate (including provisional rate) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of up to 15 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC). The recipient or subrecipient is authorized to determine the appropriate rate up to this limit. Federal agencies and pass-through entities may not require recipients and subrecipients to use a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate or the rate elected pursuant to this subsection unless required by Federal statute or regulation. The de minimis rate must not be applied to cost reimbursement contracts issued directly by the Federal Government in accordance with the FAR. Recipients and subrecipients are not required to use the de minimis rate. When applying the de minimis rate, costs must be consistently charged as either direct or indirect costs and may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. The de minimis rate does not require documentation to justify its use and may be used indefinitely. Once elected, the recipient or subrecipient must use the de minimis rate for all Federal awards until the recipient or subrecipient chooses to receive a negotiated rate.

        (g)  A recipient or subrecipient with a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of that agreement for up to four years. This extension will be subject to review and approval by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If this extension is granted, the recipient or subrecipient may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. The recipient or subrecipient must re-apply to negotiate a new rate when the extension ends. After a new rate has been negotiated, the recipient or subrecipient may again apply for a one-time extension of the new rate in accordance with this paragraph.

        § 200.415   Required certifications.

#### § § 200.415

        (a) Financial reports must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the recipient, which reads as follows: “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).”

        (b) Subrecipients under the Federal award must certify to the pass-through entity whenever applying for funds, requesting payment, and submitting financial reports: “I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information provided herein is true, complete, and accurate. I am aware that the provision of false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil, or administrative consequences including, but not limited to violations of U.S. Code Title 18, Sections 2, 1001, 1343 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812.” Each such certification must be maintained pursuant to the requirements of § 200.334. This paragraph applies to all tiers of subrecipients.

        (c) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal must comply with the following:

        (1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the recipient, must be certified by the recipient using the  or  as set forth in appendices III through VII, and IX of this part. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the recipient by an individual at a level no lower than the vice president or chief financial officer of the recipient that submits the proposal.

        (2) The Federal Government may either disallow all indirect costs or unilaterally establish an indirect cost rate when the recipient fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing a rate. This rate should be based upon audited historical data or other data furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. The rate established must ensure that potentially unallowable costs are not reimbursed. Alternatively, the recipient may use the de minimis indirect cost rate. See § 200.414(f).

        (d) Nonprofit organizations must certify that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization as defined in § 200.414(a), if applicable.

        (e) The recipient must certify that the requirements and standards for lobbying (see § 200.450) have been met when submitting its indirect cost rate proposal.

      Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes

        § 200.416   Cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals.

#### § § 200.416

        (a) Awards to states, local governments, and Indian Tribes are often implemented at the level of department within the State, local government, or Indian Tribe. A central service cost allocation plan is established to allow such department to claim a portion of centralized service costs that are incurred in proportion to the award's activities. Examples of centralized service costs may include motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, and accounting. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan establishes this process.

        (b) Individual departments typically charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate proposal for each operating department is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal awards. Indirect costs include:

        (1) The indirect costs originating in each operating department of the State, local government, or Indian Tribe carrying out Federal awards; and

        (2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.

        (c) The requirements for developing and submitting cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices V, VI, and VII of this part.

        § 200.417   Interagency service.

#### § § 200.417

        An operating department may provide services to another operating department of the same State, local government, or Indian Tribe. In these instances, the cost of services provided may include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro-rated share of indirect costs. A standard indirect cost rate equal to 15 percent of the direct salaries and wages for providing the service (excluding overtime, shift premiums, and fringe benefits) may be used instead of determining the actual indirect costs of the service. These services do not include centralized services that are included in central service cost allocation plans described in Appendix V of this part.

        § 200.418   Costs incurred by states and local governments.

#### § § 200.418

        Costs incurred or paid by a State or local government on behalf of and in direct benefit to its IHEs are allowable. These costs include but are not limited to fringe benefit programs such as pension costs and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) costs. These costs are allowable regardless of whether they are recorded in the accounting records of the institutions, subject to the following conditions:

        (a) The costs meet the requirements of § 200.402-200.411;

        (b) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with the applicable cost accounting principles of this part; and

        (c) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.

        § 200.419   Cost accounting standards.

#### § § 200.419

        An IHE that receive an aggregate total $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments subject to this subpart (as specified in § 200.101) in its most recently completed fiscal year must comply with the Cost Accounting Standards Board's cost accounting standards located at 48 CFR 9905.501, 9905.502, 9905.505, and 9905.506. CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts awarded to the IHEs are subject to the broader range of CAS requirements at 48 CFR 9900 through 9999 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30).

      General Provisions for Selected Items of Cost

        § 200.420   Considerations for selected items of cost.

#### § § 200.420

        (a) This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost, in addition to other requirements of this subpart. These principles apply whether or not a particular cost item is properly treated as a direct or indirect cost.

        (b) The following sections are not intended to be a comprehensive list of potential items of cost encountered under Federal awards. Failure to mention a particular item of cost, including as an example in certain sections, is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. When determining the allowability for an item of cost, each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related items of cost and based on the principles described in §§ 200.402 through 200.411. In case of a discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the Federal award governs. Criteria outlined in § 200.403 must be applied in determining allowability.

        § 200.421   Advertising and public relations.

#### § § 200.421

        (a) The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media includes, but is not limited to, magazines, newspapers, radio and television, direct mail, exhibits, and electronic or computer transmittals.

        (b) The only allowable advertising costs are those which are solely for:

        (1) The recruitment of personnel required by the recipient or subrecipient for the performance of a Federal award (See also § 200.463);

        (2) The procurement of goods and services for the performance of a Federal award;

        (3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of a Federal award except when the recipient or subrecipient is reimbursed for disposal costs at a predetermined amount; or

        (4) Program outreach (for example, recruiting project participants) and other specific purposes necessary to meet the Federal award requirements.

        (c) The term “public relations” includes community relations and means those activities dedicated to maintaining the recipient's or subrecipient's image or maintaining or promoting understanding and favorable relations with the community or public at large or any segment of the public.

        (d) The only allowable public relations costs are:

        (1) Costs specifically required by the Federal award;

        (2) Costs of communicating with the public and press about specific activities or accomplishments which result from the performance of the Federal award (these costs are considered necessary as part of the outreach effort for the Federal award); or

        (3) Costs of conducting general liaison with news media and government public relations officers, to the extent that such activities are limited to communication and liaison necessary to keep the public informed on matters of public concern, such as notices of funding opportunities or financial matters.

        (e) Unallowable advertising and public relations costs include the following:

        (1) All advertising and public relations costs other than as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section;

        (2) Costs of meetings, conventions, conferences, or other events related to other activities of the entity (see also § 200.432), including:

        (i) Costs of displays, demonstrations, and exhibits;

        (ii) Costs of meeting rooms, hospitality suites, and other special facilities used in conjunction with shows and other special events; and

        (iii) Salaries and wages of employees engaged in setting up and displaying exhibits, making demonstrations, and providing briefings;

        (3) Costs of promotional items and memorabilia;

        (4) Costs of advertising and public relations designed solely to promote the recipient or subrecipient.

        § 200.422   Advisory councils.

#### § § 200.422

        An advisory council or committee is a body that provides advice to the management of such entities as corporations, organizations, or foundations. Costs incurred by both internal and external advisory councils or committees are allowable if authorized by statute, the Federal agency, or as an indirect cost where allocable to Federal awards. See § 200.444, which applies to States, local governments, and Indian Tribes.

        § 200.423   Alcoholic beverages.

#### § § 200.423

        The cost of alcoholic beverages is unallowable.

        § 200.424   Alumni activities.

#### § § 200.424

        Costs incurred by IHEs for, or in support of, alumni activities are unallowable.

        § 200.425   Audit services.

#### § § 200.425

        (a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by and performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), and the requirements of this part are allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable:

        (1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part have not been conducted, or have been conducted but not in accordance with the requirements; and

        (2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $1,000,000 during its fiscal year.”

        (b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a recipient or subrecipient that does not currently have a Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal.

        (c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon procedures engagements to monitor subrecipients (in accordance with §§ 200.331-333) exempt from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and the This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon procedures engagements are:

        (1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS or applicable international attestation standards, as appropriate;

        (2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and

        (3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting.

        § 200.426   Bad debts.

#### § § 200.426

        Bad debts (debts determined to be uncollectable), including losses (whether actual or estimated) arising from uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable. Related collection costs, and related legal costs, arising from such debts are also unallowable. See § 200.428.

        § 200.427   Bonding costs.

#### § § 200.427

        (a) Bonding costs arise when the Federal agency requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others because of an act or default of the recipient or subrecipient. They also arise when the recipient or subrecipient requires similar assurance, including bonds as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds for employees and officials.

        (b) Costs of bonding required under the Federal award's terms and conditions are allowable.

        (c) Costs of bonding required by the recipient or subrecipient in the general conduct of its operations are allowable as an indirect cost to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.

        § 200.428   Collections of improper payments.

#### § § 200.428

        The costs incurred by a recipient or subrecipient to recover improper payments, including improper overpayments, are allowable as either direct or indirect costs, as appropriate. The recipient or subrecipient may use the amounts collected in accordance with cash management standards described in § 200.305.

        § 200.429   Commencement and convocation costs.

#### § § 200.429

        For IHEs, costs incurred for commencements and convocations are unallowable, except as activity costs provided for in Appendix III, (B)(9) Student Administration and Services.

        § 200.430   Compensation—personal services.

#### § § 200.430

        (a)  Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include fringe benefits addressed in § 200.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this part and that the total compensation for individual employees:

        (1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the recipient or subrecipient consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities;

        (2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's laws, rules, or written policies and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and

        (3) Is determined and supported as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, when applicable.

        (b)  Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the recipient or subrecipient. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient or subrecipient competes for the kind of employees involved.

        (c)  Unless the Federal agency expressly authorizes an arrangement, a recipient or subrecipient must follow its written policies and procedures concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the recipient or subrecipient for non-organizational compensation. Where the recipient or subrecipient does not have written policies or procedures, or they do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require the recipient or subrecipient to allocate the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards between:

        (1) Recipient or subrecipient activities, and

        (2) Non-organizational professional activities. Appropriate arrangements governing compensation must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis if the Federal agency considers the extent of non-organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (d)  (1) Costs unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section solely because they constitute personnel compensation.

        (2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with Federal statute. See 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(16), 41 U.S.C. 1127, and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(16) for the ceiling amount, covered compensation subject to the ceiling, covered employees, and other relevant provisions for cost-reimbursement contracts. For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.

        (e)  Special considerations in determining the allowability of compensation will be given to any change in a recipient's or subrecipient's compensation policy resulting in a substantial increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy.

        (f)  Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, efficient performance, suggestion awards, or safety awards is allowable to the extent that the overall compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued according to an agreement entered into in good faith between the recipient or subrecipient and the employees before the services were rendered, or according to an established plan followed by the recipient or subrecipient so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment.

        (g)  (1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must:

        (i) Be supported by a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;

        (ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the recipient or subrecipient;

        (iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the recipient or subrecipient, not exceeding 100 percent of compensated activities (for IHEs, this is the IBS);

        (iv) Encompass federally-assisted and all other activities compensated by the recipient or subrecipient on an integrated basis but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policy;

        (v) Comply with the established accounting policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient (See paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and

        (vi) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity.

        (vii) Budget estimates (meaning, estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting purposes, provided that:

        (A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the activity performed;

        (B) Significant changes in the related work activity (as defined by the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies) are promptly identified and entered into the records. Short-term (such as one or two months) fluctuations between workload categories do not need to be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term; and

        (C) The recipient's or subrecipient's system of internal controls includes processes to perform periodic after-the-fact reviews of interim charges made to a Federal award based on budget estimates. All necessary adjustments must be made so that the final amount charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated.

        (viii) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for example, the Institutional Base Salary (IBS) for IHEs), records may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distribution of total activities.

        (ix) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. Therefore, a precise assessment of factors contributing to costs is not required when IHEs record salaries and wages charged to Federal awards.

        (2) For records that meet the standards required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the recipient or subrecipient is not required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed other than that referenced in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

        (3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records indicating the total number of hours worked each day.

        (4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing requirements on Federal awards must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from Federal awards.

        (5) States, local governments, and Indian Tribes may use substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages to Federal awards either in place of or in addition to the records described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, “rolling” time studies, case counts, or other quantifiable measures of work performed.

        (i) Substitute systems that use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards, including:

        (A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii);

        (B) The sample must cover the entire period involved; and

        (C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled.

        (ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors and clerical and support staff, based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable.

        (iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in paragraph (5)(i) may be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts allocated to Federal awards will be minimal or if it concludes that the system proposed by the recipient or subrecipient will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which complies with the standards.

        (6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on outcomes and milestones for program performance when these are clearly documented. These plans are acceptable as an alternative to requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

        (7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a recipient or subrecipient may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided the plans are approved in advance by all involved Federal agencies. In these instances, the recipient or subrecipient must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to time charged.

        (8) For a recipient or subrecipient whose records do not meet the standards described in this section, the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or equivalent documentation supporting the records as required in this section.

        (h)  This paragraph (h) provides guidance specific to only nonprofit organizations. For compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the immediate families thereof, a determination must be made that the compensation is reasonable for the actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings above actual costs. Compensation may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, off-site or incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials.

        (i)  This paragraph provides guidance specific to only IHEs.

        (1)  Certain conditions require special consideration and possible limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among such conditions are the following:

        (i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable amounts for activities contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etcetera), managing substances/chemicals, managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences.

        (ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable under the written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) do not need to be included in the records described in paragraph (g). To charge payments of incidental activities directly, such activities must either be expressly authorized in the Federal award budget or receive prior written approval by the Federal agency.

        (2)  Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the academic year are allowable at the institutional base salary (IBS) rate. Except as noted in paragraph (i)(1)(ii), in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of the faculty at an institution. IBS is the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS excludes any income an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is prior approval by the Federal agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award may not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member worked on the Federal award.

        (3)  Intra-IHE consulting by faculty should be undertaken as an IHE responsibility requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation, and the work performed by the faculty members is in addition to their regular responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are expressly authorized in the Federal award or approved in writing by the Federal agency.

        (4)  Extra service pay typically represents overload compensation, subject to institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay results from Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met:

        (i) The IHE establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, not just those working on Federal awards.

        (ii) The IHE establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS, which is specific enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This definition may be described in appointment letters or other documentation.

        (iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS pay rate and additional work performed. See paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

        (iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the IHE.

        (v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards, including extra service payments, are subject to the standards of documentation as described in paragraph (g).

        (5)  (i) Except as specified for teaching activity in paragraph (i)(5)(ii) of this section, charges for work performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base salary period must be at a rate not more than the IBS.

        (ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in IBS period must be based on the written policy of the IHE governing compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods.

        (6)  Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only part-time appointments must be determined at a rate not more than that regularly paid for part-time assignments.

        (7)  Rules for sabbatical leave are as follows:

        (i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable, provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. These costs must be allocated equitably among all related activities of the IHE.

        (ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual experience under its sabbatical leave policy.

        (8)  Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn “extra service pay” in accordance with the IHE's written policy and paragraph (i)(1)(i).

        § 200.431   Compensation—fringe benefits.

#### § § 200.431

        (a)  Fringe benefits are allowances and services employers provide to their employees as compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave, employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefits. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and are required by law, an organization-employee agreement, or an established policy of the recipient or subrecipient.

        (b)  The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) They are provided under established written leave policies;

        (2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and,

        (3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently followed by the recipient or subrecipient or a specified grouping of employees.

        (i) When a recipient or subrecipient uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment and should be allocated as a general administrative expense to all activities or included in the fringe benefit rate.

        (ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a recipient or subrecipient uses the accrual basis of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded.

        (c)  The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated in § 200.447); pension plan costs; and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are permitted under established written policies. The recipient or subrecipient must allocate fringe benefits to Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs following the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting practices.

        (d)  The recipient or subrecipient may assign fringe benefits to cost objectives by identifying specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating them based on entity-wide salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made to selective groupings of employees unless the recipient or subrecipient demonstrates that costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.

        (e)  See also § 200.447(d)(1) and (2).

        (1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the liabilities for such compensation and the types of coverage, the extent of coverage, and rates and premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability.

        (2) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation. The cost of such insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is named as beneficiary.

        (3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits ( post-retirement health benefits) are allowable in the year of payment provided that the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent costing policy.

        (f)  That portion of automobile costs furnished by the recipient or subrecipient that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as a fringe benefit or indirect costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.

        (g)  Pension plan costs incurred in accordance with the established written policies of the recipient or subrecipient are allowable, provided that:

        (1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.

        (2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory.

        (3) The cost assigned to each fiscal year should be determined in accordance with GAAP, except for State and local governments.

        (4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable are unallowable. The recipient or subrecipient may follow the “Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs” (48 CFR 9904.412).

        (5) Premiums for pension plan termination insurance that are paid according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable.

        (6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.

        (i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.

        (ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund.

        (iii) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.

        (iv) When a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP.

        (v) Payments for unfunded pension costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded pension costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded pension costs are not allocable to that award.

        (vi) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed pension costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.

        (h)  A post-retirement health plan (PRHP) refers to the costs of health insurance or health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.

        (1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.

        (2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in the current year's PRHP costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund.

        (3) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.

        (4) If a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an actuarial cost method and funds PRHP costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

        (5) Payments for unfunded PRHP costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded PRHP costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded PRHP costs are not allocable to that award.

        (6) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to:

        (i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums; or

        (ii) An insurer or trustee that will maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries.

        (7) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.

        (i)  (1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages, by recipients and subrecipients to workers whose employment is being terminated. Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each case, it is required by:

        (i) Law;

        (ii) Employer-employee agreement;

        (iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the recipient's or subrecipient's part; or

        (iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.

        (2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows:

        (i) Actual severance payments for normal turnover must be allocated to all activities; or, where the recipient or subrecipient provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method is acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments made for normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient.

        (ii) Measuring the costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual method will not achieve equity for both parties. Therefore, accruals are not allowable. However, the Federal Government recognizes its responsibility to contribute its fair share toward a specific payment. Prior approval by the Federal agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is required.

        (3) Costs incurred in severance pay packages that are in excess of the standard severance pay provided by the recipient or subrecipient to an employee upon termination of employment and that are paid to the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the recipient's or subrecipient's assets, are unallowable.

        (4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the recipient or subrecipient in the United States, are unallowable unless they are required by applicable foreign law or necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.

        (5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or curtailment of activities by, the recipient or subrecipient in that country, are unallowable unless they are either:

        (i) Required by applicable foreign law; or

        (ii) Necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.

        (j)  (1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established written policies of the IHE and are distributed to all IHE activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable.

        (2) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees not employed by the IHE are limited to the tax-free amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code as amended (26 U.S.C. 127).

        (3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or reductions, provided that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at other institutions according to institutional policy. See § 200.466, for treatment of tuition remission provided to students.

        (k)  (1) For IHEs whose costs are paid by a State or local government, fringe benefit programs (such as pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs incurred specifically on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the IHE, are allowable, subject to the following:

        (i) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in §§ 200.402 through 200.411;

        (ii) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and

        (iii) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.

        (2) The allowability of these costs for the IHE does not depend on whether they are recorded in the accounting records of the IHE.

        § 200.432   Conferences.

#### § § 200.432

        A conference means an event whose primary purpose is to disseminate technical information beyond the recipient or subrecipient and is necessary and reasonable for successful performance under the Federal award. Allowable conference costs may include the rental of facilities, speakers' fees, attendance fees, costs of meals and refreshments, local transportation, and other items incidental to such conferences unless further restricted by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The costs of identifying and providing locally available dependent-care resources for participants are allowable as needed. Conference hosts/sponsors must exercise discretion and judgment in ensuring that conference costs are appropriate, necessary, and managed to minimize costs to the Federal award. The Federal agency may authorize exceptions for programs including Indian Tribes, children, and the elderly. See also §§ 200.438, 200.456, and 200.475.

        § 200.433   Contingency provisions.

#### § § 200.433

        (a) Contingency provisions are part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction projects, IT systems, or other items approved by the Federal agency) which are associated with possible events or conditions arising from causes for which the precise outcome is indeterminable at the time of estimate and that are likely to result, in the aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or project. Contingency amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events must not be included in the budget estimates for a Federal award.

        (b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates to the extent necessary to improve their precision. Contingency amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the Federal agency. As such, contingency amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements of this part (see §§ 200.300 and 200.403), be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the recipient's or subrecipient's records.

        (c) Payments to a recipient's or subrecipient's “contingency reserve” or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in §§ 200.431 and 200.447.

        § 200.434   Contributions and donations.

#### § § 200.434

        (a) Costs of contributions and donations, including cash, property, and services, from the recipient or subrecipient to other entities are unallowable.

        (b) The value of services and property donated (that is, in-kind donations) to the recipient or subrecipient may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost. The value of donated services and property may be used to meet cost sharing requirements (see § 200.306). Depreciation on donated assets is permitted so long as the donated property is not counted towards meeting cost sharing requirements (see § 200.436).

        (c) Services donated or volunteered to the recipient or subrecipient may be provided by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may not be charged to the Federal award as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services may be used to meet cost sharing requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 200.306.

        (d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the recipient or subrecipient will be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services.

        (e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to a nonprofit organization and used in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist:

        (1) The aggregate value of the services is material;

        (2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient;

        (i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services rendered, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services.

        (ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the project's total costs. Such indirect costs may be reimbursed under the Federal award or used to meet cost sharing requirements.

        (f) Fair market value of donated services must be computed as described in § 200.306.

        (g) Personal property and use of space.

        (1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a recipient or subrecipient. The value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost.

        (2) The value of the donations of personal property and use of space may be used to meet cost sharing requirements described in § 200.300. The recipient or subrecipient must value the donations in accordance with § 200.300. Where the recipient or subrecipient treats donations as indirect costs, indirect cost rates must separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement is not made.

        § 200.435   Defense and prosecution of criminal and civil proceedings, claims, appeals and patent infringements.

#### § § 200.435

        (a) —(1)  means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon verdict or a plea, including a conviction due to a plea of nolo contendere.

        (2)  include the services that bear a direct relationship to a judicial or administrative proceeding and provided by in-house or private counsel, accountants, consultants, or others engaged to assist the recipient or subrecipient before, during, or after the commencement of that proceeding.

        (3)  means:

        (i) Acts of fraud or corruption or attempts to defraud the Federal Government or to corrupt its agents,

        (ii) Acts that constitute a cause for debarment or suspension (as specified in agency regulations), and

        (iii) Acts that violate the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3732) or the Anti-kickback Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)).

        (4)  does not include restitution, reimbursement, or compensatory damages.

        (5)  includes an investigation.

        (b)  (1) Except as otherwise described herein, costs incurred in connection with any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding (including the filing of a false certification) commenced by the Federal Government, a State, local government, or foreign government, or joined by the Federal Government (including a proceeding under the False Claims Act), against the recipient or subrecipient, (or commenced by third parties or a current or former employee of the recipient or subrecipient who submits a whistleblower complaint of reprisal in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701 or 41 U.S.C. 4712), are not allowable if the proceeding:

        (i) Relates to a violation of, or failure to comply with, a Federal, State, local or foreign statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award by the recipient or subrecipient (including its agents and employees); and

        (ii) Results in any of the following dispositions:

        (A) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.

        (B) In a civil or administrative proceeding involving an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct, a determination of recipient or subrecipient liability.

        (C) In the case of any civil or administrative proceeding, the disallowance of costs, the imposition of a monetary penalty, or an order issued by the Federal agency head or delegate to the recipient or subrecipient to take corrective action under 10 U.S.C. 4701 or 41 U.S.C. 4712.

        (D) A final decision by an appropriate Federal official to debar or suspend the recipient or subrecipient, to rescind or void a Federal award, or to terminate a Federal award because of a violation or failure to comply with a statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

        (E) A disposition by consent or compromise if the action could have resulted in any of the dispositions described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.

        (2) If more than one proceeding involves the same alleged misconduct, the costs of all such proceedings are unallowable if any results in one of the dispositions shown in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (c)  If a proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is commenced by the Federal Government and is resolved by consent or compromise pursuant to an agreement by the recipient or subrecipient and the Federal Government, then the costs incurred may be allowed to the extent expressly authorized in the agreement.

        (d)  If a proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is commenced by a State, local or foreign government, then the costs incurred may be allowed if the authorized Federal official determines that the costs were incurred as a result of:

        (1) A specific term or condition of the Federal award, or

        (2) Specific written direction of an authorized official of the Federal agency.

        (e)  Costs incurred in connection with proceedings described in paragraph (b), and not made unallowable by that paragraph, may be allowed to the extent that:

        (1) The costs are reasonable and necessary for the administration of the Federal award and activities required to deal with the proceeding and the underlying cause of action;

        (2) Payment of the reasonable, necessary, allocable and otherwise allowable costs incurred is not prohibited by any other provision(s) of the Federal award;

        (3) The costs are not recovered from the Federal Government or a third party, either directly as a result of the proceeding or otherwise; and,

        (4) An authorized Federal official has determined the percentage of costs allowed considering the complexity of litigation, generally accepted principles governing the award of legal fees in civil actions involving the United States, and other factors that may be appropriate. This percentage must not exceed 80 percent unless an agreement under paragraph (c) has explicitly considered this limitation and permitted a higher percentage. In that case, the total amount of costs incurred may be allowable.

        (f)  Costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient in connection with the defense of suits brought by its employees or ex-employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1031), including the cost of all relief necessary to make the employee whole, where the recipient or subrecipient was found liable or settled, are unallowable.

        (g)  Costs for prosecuting claims against the Federal Government, including appeals of final Federal agency decisions, are unallowable.

        (h)  Costs of legal, accounting, and consultant services, and related costs incurred in connection with patent infringement litigation, are unallowable unless otherwise provided for in the Federal award.

        (i)  Costs that may be unallowable under this section, including directly associated costs, must be segregated and accounted for separately. During the pendency of any proceeding covered by paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, the Federal Government must generally withhold payment of such costs. However, if in its best interests, the Federal Government may provide for conditional payment upon provision of adequate security, or other adequate assurance, and agreement to repay all unallowable costs, plus interest, if the costs are subsequently determined to be unallowable.

        § 200.436   Depreciation.

#### § § 200.436

        (a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. The recipient or subrecipient may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP provided that they are needed and used in the recipient's or subrecipient's activities and correctly allocated to Federal awards. The compensation must be made by computing the proper depreciation.

        (b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with Appendices III through IX of this part.

        (c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the recipient or subrecipient by a third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as cost sharing but not both. When computing depreciation charges, the acquisition cost will exclude:

        (1) The cost of land;

        (2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where the title was originally vested or is presently located;

        (3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the recipient or subrecipient that is already claimed as cost sharing or where law or agreement prohibits recovery; and

        (4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award.

        (d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed:

        (1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment, technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.

        (2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be presumed to be the appropriate method. Once used, depreciation methods may not be changed unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect cost rate purposes must be the same methods used by the recipient or subrecipient for its financial statements.

        (3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each component may be depreciated over its estimated useful life in this case. The building components must be grouped into three general components: building shell (including construction and design costs), building services systems (for example, elevators, HVAC, and plumbing system), and fixed equipment (for example, sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms, and glassware/washers). A cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize a recipient or subrecipient to use more than these three groupings in exceptional cases. When a recipient or subrecipient elects to depreciate its buildings by their components, the same depreciation method must be used for indirect and financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2).

        (4) No depreciation may be allowed on assets that have outlived their depreciable lives.

        (5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (meaning, from the date the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation applicable to periods before the conversion from the use allowance method and depreciation after the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset.

        (e) Adequate property records must support depreciation charges, and physical inventories must be taken at least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. The recipient or subrecipient may use statistical sampling techniques when taking these inventories. In addition, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain adequate depreciation records showing the amount of depreciation.

        § 200.437   Employee health and welfare costs.

#### § § 200.437

        (a) Costs incurred in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies for improving working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee health, and employee performance are allowable.

        (b) These costs must be equitably apportioned to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient. Income generated from these activities must be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.

        (c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the recipient's or subrecipient's objective is to operate food services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating objectives other than the above are allowable only when:

        (1) The recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and

        (2) Approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

        § 200.438   Entertainment and prizes.

#### § § 200.438

        (a)  Costs of entertainment, including amusement, diversion, and social activities and any associated costs (such as gifts), are unallowable unless they have a specific and direct programmatic purpose and are included in a Federal award.

        (b)  Costs of prizes or challenges are allowable if they have a specific and direct programmatic purpose and are included in the Federal award. Federal agencies should refer to OMB guidance in M-10-11 “Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government,” issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.

        § 200.439   Equipment and other capital expenditures.

#### § § 200.439

        (a) See § 200.1 for the definitions of

        (b) The following rules of allowability must apply to equipment and other capital expenditures:

        (1) Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land are allowable as direct costs, but only with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (2) Capital expenditures for special purpose equipment are allowable as direct costs, provided that items with a unit cost of $10,000 or more have the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment that materially increase their value or useful life are allowable as a direct cost, but only with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. See § 200.436 on the allowability of depreciation on buildings, capital improvements, and equipment. See § 200.465 on the allowability of real property and equipment rental costs.

        (4) When approved as a direct cost in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3), capital expenditures must be charged in the period in which the expenditure is incurred or as otherwise determined appropriate and negotiated with the Federal agency.

        (5) The recipient or subrecipient may claim the unamortized portion of any equipment written off as a result of a change in capitalization levels by continuing to claim the otherwise allowable depreciation on the equipment or by amortizing the amount to be written off over a period of years negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect cost.

        (6) Cost of equipment disposal. If the Federal agency instructs the recipient or subrecipient to otherwise dispose of or transfer the equipment, the costs of disposal or transfer are allowable.

        (7) Equipment and other capital expenditures are unallowable as indirect costs. See § 200.436.

        § 200.440   Exchange rates.

#### § § 200.440

        (a) Cost increases for fluctuations in exchange rates are allowable costs subject to the availability of funding. Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.

        (b) The recipient or subrecipient is required to make reviews of local currency gains to determine the need for additional Federal funding before the expiration date of the Federal award. Subsequent adjustments for currency increases may be allowable only when the recipient or subrecipient provides the Federal agency with adequate source documentation from a commonly used source in effect at the time the expense was made, and to the extent that sufficient Federal funds are available.

        § 200.441   Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements.

#### § § 200.441

        Costs resulting from recipient or subrecipient violations of, alleged violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, State, local, tribal, or foreign laws and regulations are unallowable, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific provisions of the Federal award, or with the prior written approval of the Federal agency. See § 200.435.

        § 200.442   Fundraising and investment management costs.

#### § § 200.442

        (a) Costs of organized fundraising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and similar expenses incurred to raise capital or obtain contributions, are unallowable. Fundraising costs for meeting the Federal program objectives are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency.

        (b) Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses incurred to enhance income from investments are unallowable except when associated with investments covering pension, self-insurance, or other funds, which include Federal participation allowed by this part.

        (c) Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and securities are allowable.

        (d) Both allowable and unallowable fundraising and investment activities must be allocated an appropriate share of indirect costs in accordance with § 200.413.

        § 200.443   Gains and losses on the disposition of depreciable assets.

#### § § 200.443

        (a) The recipient or subrecipient must include gains and losses on the sale, retirement, or other disposition of depreciable property in the year they occur as credits or charges to the asset cost grouping(s) of the property. The amount of the gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized on the property and the undepreciated basis of the property.

        (b) Gains and losses from the disposition of depreciable property must not be recognized as a separate credit or charge under the following conditions:

        (1) The gain or loss is processed through a depreciation account and is reflected in the depreciation allowable under §§ 200.436 and 200.439.

        (2) The property is given in exchange as part of the purchase price of a similar item, and the gain or loss is taken into account in determining the depreciation cost basis of the new item.

        (3) A loss results from failing to maintain proper insurance, except as provided in § 200.447.

        (4) Compensation for the use of the property was provided through use allowances instead of depreciation.

        (5) Gains and losses arising from extraordinary or bulk sales, retirements, or other dispositions must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

        (c) Gains or losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of property other than the property covered in paragraph (a) of this section must be excluded in computing Federal award costs.

        (d) When assets acquired with Federal funds, in part or wholly, are disposed of, the distribution of the proceeds must be made in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316.

        § 200.444   General costs of government.

#### § § 200.444

        (a) For states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the general costs of government are unallowable except as provided in § 200.475. Unallowable costs include:

        (1) Salaries and expenses of the Office of the Governor of a State or the chief executive of a local government or the chief executive of an Indian Tribe;

        (2) Salaries and other expenses of a State legislature, tribal council, or similar local governmental body, such as a county supervisor, city council, or school board, whether incurred for purposes of legislation or executive direction;

        (3) Costs of the judicial branch of a government;

        (4) Costs of prosecutorial activities unless treated as a direct cost to a specific program if authorized by statute or regulation. However, this does not preclude the allowability of other legal activities of the Attorney General as described in § 200.435; and

        (5) Costs of other general types of government services normally provided to the general public, such as fire and police, unless provided as a direct cost under a program statute or regulation.

        (b) Indian Tribes and Councils of Governments (COGs) (see definition for  in § 200.1) may include up to 50 percent of salaries and expenses directly attributable to managing and operating Federal programs by the chief executive and their staff in the indirect cost calculation without documentation.

        § 200.445   Goods or services for personal use.

#### § § 200.445

        (a) Costs of goods or services for the personal use of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.

        (b) Housing costs (for example, depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances, and personal living expenses for the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are only allowable as direct costs and must be approved in advance by the Federal agency.

        § 200.446   Idle facilities and idle capacity.

#### § § 200.446

        (a) Definitions for the purpose of this section:

        (1) Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof, equipment individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the recipient or subrecipient.

        (2) Idle facilities mean completely unused facilities that exceed the recipient's or subrecipient's current needs.

        (3) Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between:

        (i) That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays; and

        (ii) The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multi-shift basis should be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage would normally be expected for the type of facility involved.

        (4) Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs (for example, insurance, interest, and depreciation). These costs could include the costs of idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or information technology system capacity that is built to withstand major fluctuations in load (for example, consolidated data centers).

        (b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that:

        (1) They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate, and are allocated appropriately to all benefiting programs; or

        (2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. Under this exception, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of such facilities.

        (c) The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost rates from period to period. These costs are allowable, provided that the capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Federal award or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards, subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economic, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be considered idle facilities.

        § 200.447   Insurance and indemnification.

#### § § 200.447

        (a) Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained by the terms and conditions of the Federal award are allowable.

        (b) Costs of other insurance in connection with the general conduct of activities are allowable subject to the following limitations:

        (1) The types, extent, and cost of coverage are in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy and sound business practices.

        (2) Costs of insurance or contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal Government property are unallowable except to the extent that the Federal agency has approved the costs.

        (3) Costs allowed for business interruption or other similar insurance must exclude coverage of management fees.

        (4) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibilities are allowable only when the insurance represents additional compensation (see § 200.431). This insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is identified as the beneficiary.

        (5) Insurance costs to correct defects in the recipient's or subrecipient's materials or workmanship are unallowable.

        (6) Medical liability (malpractice) insurance is an allowable cost of a Federal research program only when the program involves human subjects or training of participants in research techniques. Medical liability insurance costs must be treated as a direct cost and assigned to individual projects based on how the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance.

        (c) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through a self-insurance program or otherwise) are unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award. However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, breakage, and disappearance of small hand tools, which occur in the ordinary course of operations, are allowable.

        (d) Contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program, including workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, and severance pay, are allowable subject to the following requirements:

        (1) The type, extent, and cost of coverage and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had insurance (including reinsurance) been purchased to cover the risks. However, a provision for known or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate used for discounting the liability must be determined by considering factors such as the recipient's or subrecipient's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return.

        (2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves.

        (3)(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, and other relevant factors or information. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages must normally be limited to the value of claims:

        (A) Submitted and adjudicated but not paid;

        (B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and

        (C) Incurred but not submitted.

        (ii) Reserve exceeding the levels described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must be identified and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal.

        (4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any significant differences due to the types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured activities or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient. If individual departments or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those differences must be recognized by using separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an equitable allocation.

        (5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (for example, general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with the claims collection regulations of the cognizant agency for indirect cost.

        (e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received.

        (f) Indemnification includes securing the recipient or subrecipient against liabilities to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal Government is obligated to indemnify the recipient or subrecipient only to the extent expressly provided for in the Federal award, except as provided in paragraph (c).

        § 200.448   Intellectual property.

#### § § 200.448

        (a)  (1) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are allowable:

        (i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents required by the Federal award and of searching the art to the extent necessary to make such disclosures;

        (ii) Costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs in connection with the filing and prosecution of a United States patent application where the Federal Government requires that a title or a royalty-free license be conveyed to the Federal Government; and

        (iii) General counseling services relating to patent and copyright matters, such as advice on patent and copyright laws, regulations, clauses, and employee intellectual property agreements (See § 200.459).

        (2) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are unallowable:

        (i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents and of searching the art to make disclosures not required by the Federal award;

        (ii) Costs in connection with filing and prosecuting any foreign patent application, or any United States patent application, where the Federal award does not require conveying title or a royalty-free license to the Federal Government.

        (b)  (1) Royalties on a patent or copyright or amortization of the cost of acquiring by purchase a copyright, patent, or rights thereto, necessary for the proper performance of the Federal award are allowable unless:

        (i) The Federal Government already has a license or the right to free use of the patent or copyright.

        (ii) The patent or copyright has been adjudicated to be invalid or administratively determined to be invalid.

        (iii) The patent or copyright is considered to be unenforceable.

        (iv) The patent or copyright is expired.

        (2) Special care should be exercised in determining reasonableness when the royalties may have been obtained as a result of less-than-arm's-length bargaining, such as:

        (i) Royalties paid to persons, including corporations, affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient.

        (ii) Royalties paid to unaffiliated parties, including corporations, under an agreement entered into in contemplation that a Federal award would be made.

        (iii) Royalties paid under an agreement entered into after a Federal award is made to a recipient or subrecipient.

        (3) In any case involving a patent or copyright formerly owned by the recipient or subrecipient, the amount of royalty allowed must not exceed the cost which would have been allowed had the recipient or subrecipient retained ownership.

        § 200.449   Interest.

#### § § 200.449

        (a)  Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of the recipient's or subrecipient's own funds are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the requirements of this section.

        (b)  (1) Capital assets is defined in § 200.1. An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP.

        (2) For recipient or subrecipient fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets include patents and computer software. For software development projects, only interest attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable.

        (c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards;

        (2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value available to the recipient or subrecipient from an unrelated (arm's length) third party.

        (3) The recipient or subrecipient obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (meaning, a transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate available via such a transaction.

        (4) The recipient or subrecipient limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least expensive alternative. For example, a lease contract that transfers ownership by the end of the contract may be determined less costly than purchasing through other types of debt financing, in which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been used.

        (5) The recipient or subrecipient expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with GAAP.

        (6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under arbitrage requirements are excludable.

        (7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct facilities unless the recipient or subrecipient makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 25 percent or more. For this purpose, “initial equity contribution” means the amount or value of contributions made by the recipient or subrecipient for the acquisition of facilities prior to occupancy.

        (i) The recipient or subrecipient must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of the facility used for Federal awards.

        (ii) The recipient or subrecipient must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows:

        (A) Annually, the recipient or subrecipient must prepare a cumulative (from the project's inception) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the cost of land), and interest payments.

        (B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the recipient or subrecipient must divide the above-mentioned annual amounts by the months in the year (usually 12) that the building is in service.

        (C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to allowable interest cost. The interest rate to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill closing rate as of the last business day of that month.

        (8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable.

        (d)  For interest costs to be allowable for states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the recipient or subrecipient must have incurred the interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or after September 1, 1995, for land and equipment.

        (1) The requirement to offset the interest earned on borrowed funds against allowable interest cost (paragraph (c)(5) of this section) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds.

        (2) The recipient or subrecipient must negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, a recipient or subrecipient must consider only cash inflows and outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards.

        (e)  For interest costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.

        (f)  For interest costs to be allowable, the nonprofit organization must have incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.

        (g)  The interest allowability provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to “full coverage” under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at 48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The nonprofit organization's Federal awards are instead subject to CAS 414 (48 CFR 9904.414), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital,” and CAS 417 (48 CFR 9904.417), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction.”

        § 200.450   Lobbying.

#### § § 200.450

        (a)  The costs of certain influencing activities associated with obtaining grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or loans are unallowable. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and loans is governed by relevant statutes, including the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, “New Restrictions on Lobbying,” published on February 26, 1990, including definitions, and the Office of Management and Budget “Government-wide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying” and notices published on December 20, 1989, June 15, 1990, January 15, 1992, and January 19, 1996.

        (b)  Costs incurred in attempting to improperly influence, either directly or indirectly, an employee or officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter on any basis other than the merit.

        (c)  In addition, the following restrictions apply to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:

        (1) Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:

        (i) Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, State, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure through in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar activity;

        (ii) Establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the expenses of a political party, campaign, political action committee, or other organization established to influence the outcomes of elections in the United States;

        (iii) Any attempt to influence:

        (A) The introduction of Federal or State legislation;

        (B) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or State legislature (including efforts to influence State or local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);

        (C) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda or by urging members of the general public, or any segment thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration, march, rally, fundraising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or telephone campaign; or

        (D) Any government official or employee in connection with a decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;

        (iv) Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.

        (2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

        (i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a State legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof), in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the recipient's or subrecipient's member of congress, legislative body, subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings;

        (ii) Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to influence State legislation to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the recipient's or subrecipient's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement;

        (iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal award; or

        (iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of “lobbying” or “influencing legislation” by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct and “grass roots” lobbying activities to retain their charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.) 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:

        (A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;

        (B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and

        (C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as defined by I.R.C. 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1) through (c)(3).

        (3) When a recipient or subrecipient seeks reimbursement for indirect costs, total lobbying costs must be identified separately in the indirect cost rate proposal and thereafter be treated as other unallowable activity costs in accordance with § 200.413.

        (4) The recipient or subrecipient must submit a certification that the requirements and standards of this section have been complied with as part of its annual indirect cost rate proposal. (See § 200.415.)

        (5)(i) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of complying with the record-keeping requirements in § 200.302 with respect to lobbying costs during a particular calendar month when:

        (A) The employee engages in lobbying (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section) for 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and

        (B) Within the preceding five-year period, the recipient or subrecipient has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying costs.

        (ii) When conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, recipients and subrecipients are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time spent by employees during a calendar month.

        (iii) In consultation with OMB, the Federal agency must establish procedures for resolving, in advance, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or recipient or subrecipient from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.

        § 200.451   Losses on other awards or contracts.

#### § § 200.451

        Any excess costs over income under any other award or contract of any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the recipient's or subrecipient's contributed portion by reason of cost sharing agreements or any under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for indirect costs. Also, any excess of costs over authorized funding levels transferred from any award or contract to another is unallowable. All losses are not allowable indirect costs and must be included in the appropriate indirect cost rate base for allocating indirect costs.

        § 200.452   Maintenance and repair costs.

#### § § 200.452

        Costs incurred for utilities, insurance, security, necessary maintenance, janitorial services, repair, or upkeep of buildings and equipment (including Federal property unless otherwise provided for) which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable. Costs incurred for improvements that add to the permanent value of the buildings and equipment or appreciably prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see § 200.439). These costs are only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other agreements.

        § 200.453   Materials and supplies costs, including costs of computing devices.

#### § § 200.453

        (a) Costs incurred for materials, supplies, and fabricated parts necessary for the performance of a Federal award are allowable.

        (b) Purchased materials and supplies must be charged at their actual prices, net of applicable credits. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms must be charged at their actual net cost under any recognized method of pricing inventory withdrawals, consistently applied. Incoming transportation charges are an allowable part of materials and supplies costs.

        (c) Materials and supplies used for the performance of a Federal award may be charged as direct costs. Charging computing devices as direct costs is allowable for devices that are essential and allocable, but not solely dedicated, to the performance of a Federal award.

        (d) Where Federally-donated or furnished materials are used in performing the Federal award, the materials will be used without charge.

        § 200.454   Memberships, subscriptions, and professional activity costs.

#### § § 200.454

        (a) Costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's membership in business, technical, and professional organizations are allowable.

        (b) Costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's subscriptions to business, professional, and technical periodicals are allowable.

        (c) Costs of membership in any civic or community organization are allowable.

        (d) Costs of membership in any country club or social or dining club or organization are unallowable.

        (e) Costs of membership in organizations whose primary purpose is lobbying are unallowable. See § 200.450.

        § 200.455   Organization costs.

#### § § 200.455

        (a) Costs such as incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters, organizers or management consultants, attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the recipient or subrecipient in connection with the establishment or reorganization of an organization, are unallowable except with prior approval of the Federal agency.

        (b) The costs of any of the following activities are unallowable: activities undertaken to persuade employees of the recipient or subrecipient, or any other entity, to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of the employees' own choosing.

        (c) The costs related to data and evaluation are allowable. Data costs include (but are not limited to) the expenditures needed to gather, store, track, manage, analyze, disaggregate, secure, share, publish, or otherwise use data to administer or improve the program, such as data systems, personnel, data dashboards, cybersecurity, and related items. Data costs may also include direct or indirect costs associated with building integrated data systems—data systems that link individual-level data from multiple State and local government agencies for purposes of management, research, and evaluation. Evaluation costs include (but are not limited to) evidence reviews, evaluation planning and feasibility assessment, conducting evaluations, sharing evaluation results, and other personnel or materials costs related to the effective building and use of evidence and evaluation for program design, administration, or improvement.

        § 200.456   Participant support costs.

#### § § 200.456

        Participant support costs are allowable (see § 200.1 The classification of items as participant support costs must be documented in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies and procedures and treated consistently across all Federal awards.

        § 200.457   Plant and security costs.

#### § § 200.457

        Necessary and reasonable expenses incurred for the protection and security of facilities, personnel, and work products are allowable. Such costs include, but are not limited to, wages and uniforms of personnel engaged in security activities; equipment; barriers; protective (non-military) gear, devices, and equipment; contractual security services; and consultants. Capital expenditures for plant security purposes are subject to § 200.439.

        § 200.458   Pre-award costs.

#### § § 200.458

        Pre-award costs are those incurred before the start date of the Federal award or subaward directly pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award where such costs are necessary for efficient and timely performance of the scope of work. These costs are allowable only to the extent that they would have been allowed if incurred after the start date of the Federal award and only with the written approval of the Federal agency. If approved, these costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        § 200.459   Professional service costs.

#### § § 200.459

        (a) Costs of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill and who are not officers or employees of the recipient or subrecipient are allowable, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Federal Government. In addition, legal and related services are limited under § 200.435.

        (b) In determining the allowability of costs in a particular case, no single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. However, the following factors are relevant:

        (1) The nature and scope of the service rendered in relation to the service required.

        (2) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the recipient's or subrecipient's capability in the particular area.

        (3) The past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to receiving a Federal award(s).

        (4) The impact of Federal awards on the recipient's or subrecipient's business (meaning, what new problems have arisen).

        (5) Whether the proportion of Federal work to the recipient's or subrecipient's total business influences the recipient or subrecipient in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Federal awards.

        (6) Whether the service can be performed more economically by direct employment rather than contracting.

        (7) The qualifications of the individual or entity providing the service and the customary fees charged, especially on non-federally funded activities.

        (8) Adequacy of the contractual agreement for the service (for example, description of the service, estimate of the time required, rate of compensation, and termination provisions).

        (c) To be allowable, retainer fees must be supported by evidence of bona fide services available or rendered in addition to the factors in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 200.460   Proposal costs.

#### § § 200.460

        Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, proposals, or applications on potential Federal and non-Federal awards or projects, including developing data necessary to support the recipient's or subrecipient's bids or proposals. Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs and allocated to all current activities of the recipient or subrecipient. No proposal costs of past accounting periods may be allocated to the current period.

        § 200.461   Publication and printing costs.

#### § § 200.461

        (a) Publication costs for electronic and print media, including distribution, promotion, and general handling, are allowable. These costs should be allocated as indirect costs to all benefiting activities of the recipient or subrecipient if they are not identifiable with a particular cost objective.

        (b) Page charges, article processing charges (APCs), or similar fees such as open access fees for professional journal publications and other peer-reviewed publications resulting from a Federal award are allowable where:

        (1) The publications report work supported by the Federal Government; and

        (2) The charges are levied impartially on all items published by the journal, whether or not under a Federal award.

        (3) The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during closeout for the costs of publication or sharing of research results if the costs were not incurred during the period of performance of the Federal award. These costs must be charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency.

        § 200.462   Rearrangement and reconversion costs.

#### § § 200.462

        (a) Costs incurred for ordinary and normal rearrangement and alteration of facilities are allowable as indirect costs. Special arrangements and alterations are allowable as a direct cost if the costs are incurred specifically for a Federal award and with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (b) Costs incurred in restoring or rehabilitating the recipient's or subrecipient's facilities to approximately the same condition existing immediately before the commencement of a Federal award(s), less costs related to normal wear and tear, are allowable.

        § 200.463   Recruiting costs.

#### § § 200.463

        (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and provided that the size of the staff recruited and maintained is in keeping with workload requirements, costs of “help wanted” advertising, operating costs of an employment office necessary to secure and maintain adequate staff, costs of operating an aptitude and educational testing program, travel costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel, travel costs of applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of new employees, are allowable to the extent that such costs are incurred pursuant to the recipient's or subrecipient's standard recruitment program. When the recipient or subrecipient uses employment agencies, costs not in excess of standard commercial rates for such services are allowable.

        (b) Special emoluments, fringe benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional personnel that do not meet the test of reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the recipient or subrecipient, are unallowable.

        (c) If relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of those relocation costs. See § 200.464.

        (d) Short-term visas (as opposed to longer-term immigration visas) are generally an allowable cost and they may be proposed as a direct cost because they are issued for a specific period and purpose and can be clearly identified as directly connected to work performed on a Federal award. For these costs to be directly charged to a Federal award, they must:

        (1) Be critical and necessary for the conduct of the project;

        (2) Be allowable under the applicable cost principles;

        (3) Be consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's cost accounting practices and established written policy; and

        (4) Meet the definition of “direct cost” as described in the applicable cost principles.

        § 200.464   Relocation costs of employees.

#### § § 200.464

        (a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:

        (1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.

        (2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.

        (3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.

        (b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:

        (1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of their immediate family and their household, and personal effects to the new location.

        (2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to a maximum period of 30 calendar days.

        (3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incidental to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, are limited to eight percent of the sales price of the employee's former home.

        (4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.

        (5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as canceling an unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the monthly rental.

        (c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of the cost. If a new employee is relocating to an overseas location and dependents are not permitted for any reason, and the costs do not include transporting household goods, the costs must be considered travel costs in accordance with § 200.474 this section.

        (d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable:

        (1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home.

        (2) A loss on the sale of a former home.

        (3) Continuing mortgage principal and interest payments on a home being sold.

        (4) Income taxes paid by an employee related to reimbursed relocation costs.

        § 200.465   Rental costs of real property and equipment.

#### § § 200.465

        (a) Subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as costs of comparable rental properties; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed and if other options are available.

        (b) Rental costs under “sale and lease back” arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had continued to own the property. This amount would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.

        (c) Rental costs under “less-than-arm's-length” leases are allowable only up to the amount described in paragraph (b) of this section. For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party to the lease agreement can control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to, those between:

        (1) Divisions of the recipient or subrecipient;

        (2) The recipient or subrecipient and another entity under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and

        (3) The recipient or subrecipient and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the recipient or subrecipient or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the recipient or subrecipient may establish a separate corporation to own property and lease it back to the recipient or subrecipient.

        (4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party:

        (i) Spouse and parents thereof;

        (ii) Children and spouses thereof;

        (iii) Parents and spouses thereof;

        (iv) Siblings and spouses thereof;

        (v) Grandparents and grandchildren and spouses thereof;

        (vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 through 5 of this definition; and

        (vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

        (d) Rental costs under leases which are required to be accounted for as a financed purchase under GASB standards or a finance lease under FASB standards are allowable only up to the amount (described in paragraph (b) of this section) that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. Interest costs related to these leases are allowable if they meet the criteria in § 200.449. Unallowable costs include costs that would not have been incurred if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property, such as amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes.

        (e) Rental or lease payments are allowable under lease contracts where the recipient or subrecipient is required to recognize an intangible right-to-use lease asset under GASB standards or right-of-use operating lease asset under FASB standards for purposes of financial reporting in accordance with GAAP.

        (f) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient, including commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office is unallowable.

        § 200.466   Scholarships, student aid costs, and tuition remission.

#### § § 200.466

        (a) Costs of scholarships, fellowships, and student aid programs at IHEs are allowable only when the purpose of the Federal award is to provide training to participants, and the Federal agency approves the cost.

        (b) Tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or instead of, wages to students performing necessary work are allowable provided that:

        (1) The individual is conducting activities necessary to the Federal award;

        (2) Tuition remission and other support are provided in accordance with the established written policy of the IHE and consistently provided in a like manner to students in return for similar activities conducted under Federal awards as well as other activities; and

        (3) The student is enrolled in an advanced degree program at the IHE or an affiliated institution during the academic period and the student's activities under the Federal award are related to their degree program;

        (4) The tuition or other payments are reasonable compensation for the work performed and are conditioned explicitly upon the performance of necessary work; and

        (5) The IHE compensates students under Federal awards as well as other activities in similar manners.

        (c) Charges for tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid to students as, or instead of, salaries and wages are subject to the reporting requirements in § 200.430. The charges must be treated as a direct or indirect cost in accordance with the actual work performed. Tuition remission may be charged on an average rate basis. See § 200.431.

        § 200.467   Selling and marketing costs.

#### § § 200.467

        Costs of selling and marketing any products or services of the recipient or subrecipient are unallowable unless they are allowed under § 200.421

        § 200.468   Specialized service facilities.

#### § § 200.468

        (a) The costs of services provided by highly complex or specialized facilities operated by the recipient or subrecipient are allowable provided the charges for the services meet the conditions of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section take into account any items of income or Federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under § 200.406. These costs include charges for facilities such as computing facilities, wind tunnels,_ and_ reactors.

        (b) The costs of such services, when material, must be charged directly to the applicable Federal awards based on actual usage of the services on the basis of a schedule of rates or established methodology that:

        (1) Does not discriminate between activities under Federal awards and other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, including usage by the recipient or subrecipient for internal purposes; and

        (2) Is designed to recover only the aggregate costs of the services. Each service's costs must normally consist of its direct costs and an allocable share of all indirect costs. Rates must be adjusted at least biennially and must consider any over or under-applied costs of the previous period(s).

        (c) Where the costs incurred for a service are not material, they may be allocated as indirect costs.

        (d) Under extraordinary circumstances, the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the recipient or subrecipient may negotiate and establish an alternative costing arrangement if it is in the Federal Government's best interest.

        § 200.469   Student activity costs.

#### § § 200.469

        Costs incurred for intramural activities, student publications, student clubs, and other student activities are unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award.

        § 200.470   Taxes (including Value Added Tax).

#### § § 200.470

        (a)  (1) Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are allowable, except for self-assessed taxes that disproportionately affect Federal programs or changes in tax policies that disproportionately affect Federal programs.

        (2) Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are, in effect, user fees for benefits provided to the Federal Government are allowable.

        (3) This provision does not restrict the authority of the Federal agency to identify taxes where Federal participation is inappropriate. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may accept a reasonable approximation in circumstances where determining the amount of unallowable taxes would require an excessive amount of effort.

        (b)  (1) Taxes that the recipient or subrecipient is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP are generally allowable. These costs include payments made to local governments instead of taxes and that are commensurate with the local government services received. The following taxes are unallowable:

        (i) Taxes for which exemptions are available to the recipient or subrecipient directly or which are available to the recipient or subrecipient based on an exemption afforded the Federal Government and, in the latter case, when the Federal agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates;

        (ii) Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements; and

        (iii) Federal income taxes.

        (2) Any refund of taxes and interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, must be credited to the Federal Government as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate. However, any interest paid or credited to a recipient or subrecipient incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the Federal Government has reimbursed the recipient or subrecipient for the taxes, interest, and penalties.

        (c)  Foreign taxes charged for procurement transactions that a recipient or subrecipient is legally required to pay in a country are allowable. Foreign tax refunds or applicable credits under Federal awards refer to receipts or reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. To the extent that such credits accrued or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to allowable cost, these costs must be credited to the Federal agency as a cost reduction or cash refunds, as appropriate. In cases where the costs are credited back to the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may reduce the Federal share of costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, the Federal agency may allow the recipient or subrecipient to use the foreign government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award.

        § 200.471   Telecommunication and video surveillance costs.

#### § § 200.471

        (a) Costs incurred for telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment such as phones, internet, video surveillance, and cloud servers are allowable except for the following circumstances:

        (b) Obligating or expending covered telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment or services as described in § 200.216 to:

        (1) Procure or obtain, extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain;

        (2) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure; or

        (3) Obtain the equipment, services, or systems.

        § 200.472   Termination and standard closeout costs.

#### § § 200.472

        (a)  Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs or the need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They must be used in conjunction with the other termination requirements of this part.

        (1) The cost of items reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work is unallowable unless the recipient or subrecipient submits evidence that it would not retain such items without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the recipient or subrecipient, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should consider the recipient's or subrecipient's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the recipient or subrecipient must be considered evidence that the items are reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order do not exceed the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.

        (2) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot discontinue certain costs immediately after the effective termination date, despite making all reasonable efforts, then the costs are generally allowable within the limitations of this part. Any costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the recipient or subrecipient to immediately discontinue the costs are unallowable.

        (3) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if:

        (i) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the recipient or subrecipient;

        (ii) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the Federal agency (see § 200.313 (d)); and

        (iii) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to the portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired.

        (4) If paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (ii) below are satisfied, rental costs under unexpired leases (less the residual value of such leases) are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award. These rental costs may include the cost of alterations of the leased property and the cost of reasonable restoration required by the lease, provided the alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award.

        (i) The amount of claimed rental costs does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and a further period as may be reasonable; and

        (ii) The recipient or subrecipient makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of the lease.

        (5) The following settlement expenses are generally allowable.

        (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs that are reasonably necessary for:

        (A) The preparation and presentation to the Federal agency or pass-through entity of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see §§ 200.339-200.343); and

        (B) The termination and settlement of subawards.

        (ii) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award.

        (6) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims common to the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with contractors and subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is consistent with the requirements of § 200.414. These allocated indirect costs must exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.

        (b)  Administrative costs associated with the closeout activities of a Federal award are allowable. The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during the closeout for the necessary administrative costs of that Federal award (for example, salaries of personnel preparing final reports, publication and printing costs, costs associated with the disposition of equipment and property, and related indirect costs). These costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency.

        § 200.473   Training and education costs.

#### § § 200.473

        The cost of training and education provided for employee development is allowable.

        § 200.474   Transportation costs.

#### § § 200.474

        Costs incurred for freight, express, cartage, postage, and other transportation services relating to goods purchased, in process, or delivered, are allowable. When the costs can be readily identified with the items involved, they may be charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. When identification with the materials received cannot be readily made, the inbound transportation cost may be charged to the appropriate indirect cost accounts if the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent, equitable procedure in this respect. If reimbursable under the terms and conditions of the Federal award, outbound freight should be treated as a direct cost.

        § 200.475   Travel costs.

#### § § 200.475

        (a)  Travel costs include the transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the recipient or subrecipient. These costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip. The method used must be consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the recipient's or subrecipient's other activities and in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 200.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity when they are specifically related to the Federal award.

        (b)  Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the recipient or subrecipient in its regular operations as the result of the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy. In addition, if these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that:

        (1) Participation of the individual is necessary for the Federal award; and

        (2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy.

        (c)  (1) Temporary dependent care costs (dependent is defined in 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular dependent care are allowable provided that these costs:

        (i) Are a direct result of the individual's travel to a conference for the Federal award;

        (ii) Are consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy for all travel; and

        (iii) Are only temporary during the travel period.

        (2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of six months or more with prior approval of the Federal agency. See § 200.432.

        (d)  In the absence of an established written policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11 (“Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances”), by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or their designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)).

        (e)  (1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would:

        (i) Require circuitous routing;

        (ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours;

        (iii) Excessively prolong travel;

        (iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or

        (v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The recipient or subrecipient must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis for the use of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases.

        (2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a recipient's or subrecipient's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare is unavailable for specific trips if the recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate that such airfare was not available in the specific case.

        (f)  Travel costs by recipient or subrecipient-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft include the cost of the lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of these costs that exceeds the cost of airfare, as provided for in paragraph (d), is unallowable.

        § 200.476   Trustees.

#### § § 200.476

        Travel and subsistence costs of trustees (or directors) at IHEs and nonprofit organizations are allowable. See § 200.475.

    Subpart F—Audit Requirements

      General

        § 200.500   Purpose.

#### § § 200.500

        This part sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards.

      Audits

        § 200.501   Audit requirements.

#### § § 200.501

        (a)  A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.

        (b)  A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more in Federal awards during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year must have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 200.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

        (c)  A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with § 200.507 if the following conditions are met:

        (1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding research and development); and

        (2) The Federal program's statutes or regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, do not require a financial statement audit of the non-Federal entity.

        (d)  A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit for research and development conducted in accordance with § 200.507, but only if all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards only from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity; and

        (2) The Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves a program-specific audit in advance.

        (e)  A non-Federal entity that expends less than $1,000,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 200.503. However, in all instances, the records of the non-Federal entity must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

        (f)  Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.

        (g)  An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Unless a program is exempt by Federal statute, Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. Payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor under a Federal award (see § 200.331) are not subject to audit under this part.

        (h)  In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not flow down to contractors. However, for procurement transactions in which the contractor is made responsible for meeting program requirements, the auditee must ensure those requirements are met, including by clearly stating the contractor's responsibilities within the contract and reviewing the contractor's records to determine compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include a determination of whether these transactions comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. See also § 200.318(b).

        (i)  This subpart does not apply to for-profit organizations. As necessary, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The subaward with a for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring throughout the performance of the subaward, and post-award audits (see § 200.332).

        § 200.502   Basis for determining Federal awards expended.

#### § § 200.502

        (a)  The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity related to the Federal award pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as:

        (1) Expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cooperative agreements, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, and direct appropriations;

        (2) The disbursement of funds to subrecipients;

        (3) The use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs;

        (4) The receipt of property (including surplus property);

        (5) The receipt or use of program income;

        (6) The distribution or use of food commodities;

        (7) The disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and

        (8) The period when insurance is in force.

        (b)  The Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid. Therefore, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs (except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d)):

        (1) The value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus

        (2) The balance of loans from previous years at the beginning of the audit period for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus

        (3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.

        (c)  When loans are made to students of an IHE, but the IHE itself does not have continuing compliance requirements for the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period are considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.

        (d)  Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.

        (e)  The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted is considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.

        (f)  Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in determining Federal awards expended and is subject to audit under this part.

        (g)  Federal non-cash assistance (such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property that is received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program) must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency and must be included in determining Federal awards expended under this part.

        (h)  Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.

        (i)  Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.

        (j)  For purposes of this part, loans from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended.

        § 200.503   Relation to other audit requirements.

#### § § 200.503

        (a)  An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such an audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and use that information.

        (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a Federal agency, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange additional audits to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency must plan such audits not to be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed by other auditors.

        (c)  The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal officials. For example, requirements that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies.

        (d)  A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.

        (e)  A Federal agency may request that an auditee have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. Such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited to allow for planning. After consultation with its auditor, the auditee should promptly respond to such a request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in § 200.518 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. With approval of the Federal agency, a pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.

        § 200.504   Frequency of audits.

#### § § 200.504

        Audits required by this part must be performed annually unless biennial audits are permitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Biennial audits must cover both fiscal years within the biennial period.

        (a) A State, local government, or Indian Tribe that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo biennial (every other year) audits pursuant to this part. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period.

        (b) Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo biennial audits pursuant to this part.

        § 200.505   Remedies for audit noncompliance.

#### § § 200.505

        In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a non-federal entity to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies or pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in § 200.339.

        § 200.506   Audit costs.

#### § § 200.506

        See § 200.425.

        § 200.507   Program-specific audits.

#### § § 200.507

        (a)  In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor concerning internal controls, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found in the compliance supplement (Appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides). When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.

        (b)  (1) When a current program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.

        (2) The auditee must prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(c).

        (3) The auditor must:

        (i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS;

        (ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the Federal program consistent with the requirements for a major program in accordance with§ 200.514(c);

        (iii) Determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements for a major program under § 200.514(d);

        (iv) Follow up on prior audit findings and perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511 When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must report this condition as a current-year audit finding.; and

        (v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.516.

        (4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

        (i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;

        (ii) A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which must describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;

        (iii) A report on compliance that includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and

        (iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with § 200.515(d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of § 200.515(d)(3).

        (c)  (1)  The audit must be completed and submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. Unless a different period is specified in the program-specific audit guide, the audit must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period (whichever is earlier). The submission is due the next business day when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

        (2)  When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee must electronically submit the data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b), as applicable to the program-specific audit, to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The submission must also include the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide.

        (3)  When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee must electronically submit the data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b) to the FAC. The submission must also include the financial statement(s) of the Federal program, summary schedule of prior audit findings, and corrective action plan as described in paragraph § 200.507(b)(2) and the auditor's report(s) described in paragraph § 200.507(b)(4).

        (d)  Program-specific audits are subject to:

        (1) 200.500 Purpose through 200.503 Relation to other audit requirements, paragraph (d);

        (2) 200.504 Frequency of audits through 200.506 Audit costs;

        (3) 200.508 Auditee responsibilities through 200.509 Auditor selection;

        (4) 200.511 Audit findings follow-up;

        (5) 200.512 Report submission, paragraphs (e) through (h);

        (6) 200.513 Responsibilities;

        (7) 200.516 Audit findings through 200.517 Audit documentation;

        (8) 200.521 Management decision; and

        (9) Other referenced provisions of this part unless contrary to the provisions of this section, a program-specific audit guide, or program statutes and regulations.

      Auditees

        § 200.508   Auditee responsibilities.

#### § § 200.508

        The auditee must:

        (a) Arrange for the audit required by this part in accordance with § 200.509, and ensure it is properly performed and submitted in accordance with § 200.512.

        (b) Prepare financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with § 200.510.

        (c) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings. This includes preparing a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with § 200.511(b) and (c), respectively.

        (d) Provide the auditor access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and any other information needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this part.

        § 200.509   Auditor selection.

#### § § 200.509

        (a)  When procuring audit services, the auditee must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.317 through 200.327 of subpart D or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. When requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear, and the non-Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report, which the auditor must provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make efforts to contract with businesses as stated in § 200.321 or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.

        (b)  An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceed $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used to prepare the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.

        (c)  Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they fully comply with the requirements of this part.

        § 200.510   Financial statements.

#### § § 200.510

        (a)  The auditee must prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year chosen to meet this part's requirements. However, organization-wide financial statements of the non-Federal entity may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 200.514(a) and prepare separate financial statements.

        (b)  The auditee must also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. The schedule must include the total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with § 200.502. The auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal agencies or pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple Federal award years, the auditee may separately list the amount of Federal awards expended for each year of a Federal award. The schedule must:

        (1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency using the applicable Assistance Listing number(s). For a cluster of programs, the non-Federal entity must provide the cluster name, a list of individual Federal programs within the cluster, and provide the Federal agency name and the applicable Assistance Listing number(s). For research and development, total Federal awards expended must be shown either by individual Federal award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision within the Department of Health and Human Services.

        (2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity must be included.

        (3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the Assistance Listings number or other identifying number when the Assistance Listings information is unavailable. For a cluster of programs, the auditee must also provide the total for the cluster.

        (4) Include the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program.

        (5) For loan or loan guarantee programs described in § 200.502(b), identify in the notes to the schedule the balances outstanding at the end of the audit period. This requirement is in addition to including the total Federal awards expended for loan or loan guarantee programs in the schedule.

        (6) Include notes describing the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and whether the auditee elected to use the de minimis indirect cost rate of up to 15 percent (see § 200.414).

        § 200.511   Audit findings follow-up.

#### § § 200.511

        (a)  The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 200.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include financial statement findings that the auditor was required to report in accordance with GAGAS.

        (b)  The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.

        (2) When audit findings were not corrected or only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence, planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When the corrective action taken significantly differs from the corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.

        (3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:

        (i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the FAC;

        (ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and

        (iii) A management decision was not issued.

        (c)  At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the auditor's report for the current year. The corrective action plan must be a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 200.516. The corrective action plan must also provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for the corrective action, the corrective action to be taken, and the anticipated completion date. When the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, the corrective action plan must include a detailed explanation of the reasons.

        § 200.512   Report submission.

#### § § 200.512

        (a)  (1) The audit, the data collection form, and the reporting package must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period (whichever is earlier). The cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit (in the absence of a cognizant agency for audit) may authorize an extension when the nine-month timeframe would place an undue burden on the auditee. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.

        (2) The auditee must make copies available for public inspection unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

        (b)  The FAC is the repository of record for subpart F reporting packages and the data collection form. All Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC.

        (1) The auditee must submit the required data collection form described in Appendix X of this part. This form provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, the results of the audit, and whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part. The form must include all information required by this part that is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure the integrity of Federal programs. The form includes data elements and a format that OMB must approve, is available from the FAC, and include collections of information from the reporting package described in paragraph (c).

        (2) A senior-level representative of the auditee (for example, a State controller, director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form stating that the auditee complied with the requirements of this part, including that:

        (i) The data collection form was prepared in accordance with this part (and the instructions accompanying the form);

        (ii) The reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information;

        (iii) The information included in its entirety is accurate and complete; and

        (iv) The FAC is authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available on a website.

        (3) An auditee that is an Indian Tribe or a tribal organization (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination, Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 450b(l)) may opt not to authorize the FAC to make the reporting package publicly available on a website. To opt-out, an Indian Tribe or tribal organization must exclude the authorization described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. In these instances, the Indian Tribe is responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any pass-through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to pass-through entities for which the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any findings related to those Federal awards that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation, if the Indian Tribe opts not to authorize publication, it must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection.

        (4) The auditor must complete the applicable data elements of the data collection form using the information included in the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section. The auditor must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form stating:

        (i) The source of information included in the data collection form;

        (ii) The auditor's responsibility for the information;

        (iii) The data collection form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in paragraph (c); and

        (iv) The content of the form is limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB.

        (c)  The reporting package must include the following:

        (1) Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards discussed in § 200.510(a) and (b), respectively;

        (2) Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in § 200.511(b);

        (3) Auditor's report(s) discussed in § 200.515; and

        (4) Corrective action plan discussed in § 200.511(c).

        (d)  The auditee must electronically submit the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section to the FAC.

        (e)  Auditees must submit, when requested by a Federal agency or pass-through entity, a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor.

        (f)  Auditees must keep a copy of the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and a copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) on file for three years from the date of submission to the FAC. Copies of audit records must be maintained in accordance with § 200.336.

        (g)  The FAC must make available the reporting packages received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 200.507(c) to the public, except for Indian Tribes exercising the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and maintain a database of completed audits, provide appropriate information to Federal agencies, and follow up with known auditees that have not submitted the required data collection forms and reporting packages.

        (h)  Nothing in this part must preclude electronic submissions to the FAC in such a manner as may be approved by OMB.

      Federal Agencies

        § 200.513   Responsibilities.

#### § § 200.513

        (a)  (1) A non-Federal entity expending more than $50 million a year in Federal awards must have a cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for audit must be the Federal agency that provides the largest amount of direct funding (as listed on the non-Federal entity's Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see § 200.510(b)) unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total expenditures (as direct and subawards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated cognizant agency for audit.

        (2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years ending in 2019 and every fifth year after that.

        (3) Notwithstanding how audit cognizance is determined, a Federal agency may reassign cognizance to another Federal agency that provides substantial funding to an auditee if it agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit must notify the FAC, the auditee, and the auditor (if known) of the change.

        (4) The cognizant agency for audit must:

        (i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors.

        (ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors and provide the results to other interested organizations.

        (iii) Cooperate and support the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a government-wide analysis to assess the quality of single audits. The government-wide analysis may rely on the current and ongoing quality control review work performed by Federal agencies, State auditors, and professional audit associations. This government-wide audit analysis must be performed at an interval determined by OMB, and the results must be posted publicly. In providing support to the government-wide analysis, a Federal agency must provide the following:

        (A) An assessment of the extent to which single audits conform to the requirements, standards, and procedures of this part; and

        (B) Recommendations to address audit quality issues, including recommendations for any changes to this part's requirements, standards, and procedures.

        (iv) Promptly inform the appropriate Federal law enforcement officials and impacted Federal agencies of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS, Federal statute, or regulation.

        (v) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies.

        (vi) Advise the auditor, Federal awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.

        (vii) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon, rather than duplicate, audits performed in accordance with this part.

        (viii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal agency whose awards are included in the audit finding of the auditee. Cross-cutting audit finding means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity); for example, a cross-cutting audit finding may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.

        (ix) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.

        (x) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal year.

        (b)  An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with § 200.1  A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to another Federal agency that agrees to be the _oversight agency for audit._ Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit:

        (1) Must provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.

        (2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.

        (c)  In addition to all other requirements of this part, the awarding Federal agency must:

        (1) Ensure that audits are completed, and reports are received in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of this part.

        (2) Provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.

        (3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that non-Federal entities take appropriate and timely corrective action. Follow-up includes:

        (i) Issuing a management decision in accordance with § 200.521;

        (ii) Monitoring the non-Federal entity's progress implementing a corrective action;

        (iii) Using a cooperative audit resolution approach to improve Federal program outcomes through better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action, which means the use of audit follow-up techniques promoting prompt corrective action by improving communication, fostering collaboration, promoting trust, and developing an understanding between the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This approach is based upon:

        (A) A strong commitment by Federal agency and non-Federal entity leadership to Federal program integrity;

        (B) Federal agencies strengthening partnerships and working cooperatively with non-Federal entities and their auditors; non-Federal entities and their auditors working cooperatively with Federal agencies;

        (C) A focus on current conditions and corrective action going forward;

        (D) Federal agencies offering appropriate relief for past noncompliance when audits show prompt corrective action has occurred; and

        (E) Federal agency leadership sending a clear message that continued failure to correct conditions identified by audits likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, or abuse is unacceptable and will result in sanctions.

        (iv) Tracking the effectiveness of the Federal agency's follow-up processes, the effectiveness of single audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability, and the use of single audits in making Federal award decisions. The Federal agency should develop a baseline, metrics, and targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow up on audit findings.

        (4) Provide OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement. These updates include working with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor on testing the compliance requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse, or generate audit findings for which the Federal agency will take action in accordance with § 200.505. Prior to submitting compliance supplement drafts to OMB, Federal agencies should engage with external audit stakeholders, the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General, and the National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).

        (5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy officials of the Federal agency. The accountable official must be:

        (i) Responsible for ensuring that the Federal agency fulfills the requirements of this section and effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal program outcomes.

        (ii) Accountable for improving the effectiveness of the Federal agency's single audit processes in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv).

        (iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison.

        (6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison. The liaison must:

        (i) Serve as the Federal agency's point of contact for the single audit process within and outside the Federal Government.

        (ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and information sharing. This includes coordinating audit follow-up, identifying higher risk non-Federal entities, providing input on single audit and follow-up policy, enhancing the utility of the FAC, and identifying ways to use single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices.

        (iii) Oversee training for the Federal agency's program management personnel related to the single audit process.

        (iv) Promote the Federal agency's use of a cooperative audit resolution approach as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

        (v) Coordinate the Federal agency's audit follow-up processes and ensure non-Federal entities implement corrective actions for audit findings.

        (vi) Ensure the Federal agency fulfills its responsibility, as a cognizant agency for audit, to coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings under (a)(4)(viii) of this section. Cross-cutting audit findings means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity). For example, this may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.

        (vii) Ensure the Federal agency provides OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement consistent with the compliance supplement preparation guide.

        (viii) Support the mission of the Federal agency's single audit accountable official and coordinate with the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General and National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).

      Auditors

        § 200.514   Standards and scope of audit.

#### § § 200.514

        (a)  The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must also cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during the audit period. In these instances, the audit must include the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period.

        (b)  The auditor must determine whether the auditee's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

        (c)  (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

        (2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:

        (i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and

        (ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

        (4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 200.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.

        (d)  (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.

        (2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.

        (3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements, and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included.

        (4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions or other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.

        (e)  The auditor must follow up on prior audit findings regardless of whether a prior audit finding is related to a major program in the current year. Audit follow-up includes performing procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511. When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must report this condition as a current-year audit finding.

        (f)  As required in § 200.512(b)(4), the auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.

        § 200.515   Audit reporting.

#### § § 200.515

        The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

        (a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) on whether the financial statement(s) of the auditee is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must also decide whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

        (b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of internal control and compliance testing and the results of the tests. Where applicable, the report must refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance and include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on each major program and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:

        (1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:

        (i) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion) on whether the audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP;

        (ii) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements;

        (iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements of the auditee;

        (iv) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;

        (v) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion) on compliance for major programs;

        (vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 200.516(a);

        (vii) An identification of major programs by listing each individual major program; however, in the case of a cluster of programs, only the cluster name as shown on the schedule of expenditures of Federal Awards is required; (viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in § 200.518(b)(1) or (3) when a recalculation of the Type A threshold is required for large loan or loan guarantees; and

        (ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under§ 200.520.

        (2) Findings relating to the financial statements required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

        (3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 200.516(a) and be reported in the following manner:

        (i) Audit findings (for example, internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue must be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and Federal awards (this paragraph (d)(3)) must be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form and reference a detailed reporting in the other section.

        (e) Nothing in this part precludes combining the reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 200.512(b) when allowed by GAGAS and Appendix X of this part.

        § 200.516   Audit findings.

#### § § 200.516

        (a)  The auditor must report the following as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs:

        (1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or a material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.

        (2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.

        (3) Known questioned costs when either known or likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. When reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.

        (4) Known questioned costs greater than $25,000 for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (for example, as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, the auditor must report this as an audit finding.

        (5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is other than an unmodified opinion. This must be included unless the circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs.

        (6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless the fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. This paragraph does not require the auditor to publicly report information that could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.

        (7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 200.511(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

        (b)  Audit findings must be presented with sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies or pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. As applicable, the following information must be included in audit findings:

        (1) The Federal program and specific Federal award identification, including the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, the name of the Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the Assistance Listings title and number or Federal award identification number, is unavailable, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.

        (2) The criteria or specific requirement for the audit finding (for example, the specific Federal statute, regulation, or term and condition of the Federal award). The criteria or specific requirement provides a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings. The criteria should generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation.

        (3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

        (4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action

        (5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency or pass-through entity to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.

        (6) The identification of known questioned costs, by applicable Assistance Listing number(s) and Federal award identification number(s), and how these questioned costs were computed.

        (7) When there are known questioned costs but the dollar amount is undetermined or not reported, a description of why the dollar amount was undetermined or otherwise could not be reported.

        (8) Information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the audit finding. For example, whether the audit finding represents an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. In addition, the audit finding should indicate whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.

        (9) The identification of whether the audit finding is a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit. The audit finding must identify the applicable prior year audit finding reference numbers in these instances.

        (10) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

        (11) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.

        (c)  Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission (see § 200.512(b)).

        § 200.517   Audit documentation.

#### § § 200.517

        (a)  The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. The cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity may extend the retention period by providing written notification to the auditor. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to the destruction of the audit documentation and reports.

        (b)  Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, cognizant agency for indirect cost, a Federal agency, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation as is reasonable and necessary.

        § 200.518   Major program determination.

#### § § 200.518

        (a)  The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach must consider current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process described in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section must be followed.

        (b)  (1) The auditor must identify and label the larger Federal programs as Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the levels outlined in table 1:

        (2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be labeled Type B programs.

        (3) Including large loans and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. A Federal program providing loans is considered a large loan program when it exceeds four times the largest non-loan program. The auditor must identify each large loan program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For this paragraph, a program is only considered a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal awards expended for loans within the program comprises 50 percent or more of the total Federal awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program, and the value of Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in § 200.502.

        (4) For biennial audits (see § 200.504), the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based on the Federal awards expended during the two-year audit period.

        (c)  (1) The auditor must identify Type A programs that are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor must consider whether the requirements in § 200.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and preclude the program from being low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the program must not have had:

        (i) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);

        (ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or

        (iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for the program.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal agency request that a Type A program not be considered low-risk for a specific recipient. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year for a particular recipient for the Federal agency to comply with 31 U.S.C. 3515. The Federal agency must notify the auditee and, if known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited.

        (d)  (1) The auditor must identify high-risk Type B programs using professional judgment and the criteria in § 200.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at least one-fourth of the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under step two. Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 200.519(b)(1), (2), and (c)(1), a single criterion in risk would rarely cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to assess for risk, the auditor is encouraged to use an approach that provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major programs over a period of time.

        (2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed 25 percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in step one.

        (e)  At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs:

        (1) All Type A programs not identified as low-risk under step two.

        (2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three.

        (3) Additional programs as necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule described in paragraph (f). This rule may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the number of Type A programs.

        (f)  When the auditee meets the criteria in § 200.520, the auditor only needs to audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) of total Federal awards expended.

        (g)  The auditor must include in the audit documentation the risk analysis used for determining major programs.

        (h)  The auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs must be presumed correct when the determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part. Challenges by a Federal agency or pass-through entity must only be for clearly improper use of the requirements in this part. However, a Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program. The auditor must consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.

        § 200.519   Criteria for Federal program risk.

#### § § 200.519

        (a)  The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the Federal program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as those described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

        (b)  (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Therefore, consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs. This includes considering factors such as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.

        (i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (for example, one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.

        (ii) A weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk when significant parts of a Federal program are passed to subrecipients through subawards.

        (2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, especially when the situations identified in the audit findings could significantly impact a Federal program or have not been corrected.

        (3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than those recently audited as major programs without audit findings.

        (c)  (1) The oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities may be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.

        (2) With the concurrence of OMB, a Federal agency may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will identify these Federal programs in the compliance supplement.

        (d)  (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third-party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may be at high risk for noncompliance with the requirements of § 200.430 but otherwise be at low risk.

        (2) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.

        (3) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to the start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.

        (4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

        § 200.520   Criteria for a low-risk auditee.

#### § § 200.520

        An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods must qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with § 200.518.

        (a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, including submitting the data collection form and the reporting package to the FAC within the timeframe specified in § 200.512. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.

        (b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law), and the auditor's in-relation-to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unmodified.

        (c) No internal control deficiencies were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.

        (d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.

        (e) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:

        (1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);

        (2) A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or

        (3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent (.05) of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.

      Management Decisions

        § 200.521   Management decisions.

#### § § 200.521

        (a)  The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements, which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

        (b)  The cognizant agency for audit is responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency (see § 200.513(a)(4)(viii)). The awarding Federal agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect the Federal awards it makes to a non-Federal entity (see § 200.513(c)(3)(i)).

        (c)  The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect subawards it issues to subrecipients under a Federal award (see § 200.332(e)).

        (d)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within six months of the FAC's acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.

        (e)  Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 200.516(c).
