The accelerometer's seismic mass with respect to the mounting bolt center line is 0.9 inches up, 0.7 inches to the left for left side impact and 0.03 inches to the left for right side impact, and 0.5 inches rearward from the rear wall mounting surface as shown in Figure 31 in appendix A to subpart F of part 572. Maximum permissible variation of the seismic location must not exceed 0.2 inches spherical radius.\n",
                  "(d) Instrumentation and sensors used must conform to the SAE J-211 (1980) recommended practice requirements (incorporated by reference; see § 572.40). The outputs of the accelerometers installed in the dummy are then processed with the software for the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter (FIR 100 software). The FORTRAN program for this FIR 100 software (FIR100 Filter Program, Version 1.0, July 16, 1990) is incorporated by reference in this part (see § 572.40). The data are processed in the following manner:\n",
                  "(1) Analog data recorded in accordance with SAE J-211 (1980) recommended practice channel class 1000 specification.\n",
                  "(2) Filter the data with a 300 Hz, SAE Class 180 filter;\n",
                  "(3) Subsample the data to a 1600 Hz sampling rate;\n",
                  "(4) Remove the bias from the subsampled data, and\n",
                  "(5) Filter the data with the FIR100 Filter Program (Version 1.0, July 16, 1990), which has the following characteristics—\n",
                  "(i) Passband frequency, 100 Hz.\n",
                  "(ii) Stopband frequency, 189 Hz.\n",
                  "(iii) Stopband gain, −50 db.\n",
                  "(iv) Passband ripple, 0.0225 db.\n",
                  "(e) The mountings for the spine, rib and pelvis accelerometers shall have no resonance frequency within a range of 3 times the frequency range of the applicable channel class.\n",
                  "(f) Limb joints of the test dummy are set at the force between 1-2 g's, which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended horizontally forward. The force required to move a limb segment does not exceed 2 g's throughout the range of limb motion.\n",
                  "(g) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 °F to 78 °F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 percent after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of not less than 4 hours.\n",
                  "(h) For the performance of tests specified in §§ 572.42 and 572.43, the dummy is positioned as follows:\n",
                  "(1) The dummy is placed on a flat, rigid, clean, dry, horizontal smooth aluminum surface whose length and width dimensions are not less than 16 inches, so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and centered on the test surface. The dummy's torso is positioned to meet the requirements of § 572.42 and § 572.43. The seating surface is without the back support and the test dummy is positioned so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and centered on the seat surface.\n",
                  "(2) The legs are positioned so that their centerlines are in planes parallel to the midsagittal plane.\n",
                  "(3) Performance pre-tests of the assembled dummy are separated in time by a period of not less than 20 minutes unless otherwise specified.\n",
                  "(4) Surfaces of the dummy components are not painted except as specified in this part or in drawings subtended by this part.\n"

The notification shall contain the information specified in this section. The information required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be presented in the form and order specified. The information required by paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may be presented in any order. Except as authorized by the Administrator, the manufacturer shall submit a copy of its proposed owner notification letter, including any provisions or attachments related to reimbursement, to NHTSA's Recall Management Division (NVS-215) no fewer than five (5) Federal Government business days before it intends to begin mailing it to owners.

It shall also imprint on the outside of this envelope a label in accordance with § 577.14. Except where the format of the envelope has been previously approved by NHTSA's Recall Management Division (NVS-215), each manufacturer must submit the envelope format it intends to use to that division at least five (5) Federal Government business days before mailing the notification to owners. Submission of envelopes and proposed owner notification letters shall be made by the means identified in 49 CFR 573.9.

The Administrator shall toll the 120-day period for submission of a certification to the Administrator pursuant to § 592.6(d) of this chapter during the period from the date of the Registered Importer's notification to the importer until the date of the contract with the substitute Registered Importer.\n",

              "(a) With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports into the United States, assure that the Administrator has decided that the vehicle is eligible for importation pursuant to Part 593 of this chapter prior to such importation. The Registered Importer must also bring such vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under Part 571 of this chapter and the bumper standard prescribed under Part 581 of this chapter, if applicable, and furnish certification to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, within 120 calendar days after such entry. For each motor vehicle, the Registered Importer must furnish to the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time of importation a bond in an amount equal to 150 percent of the dutiable value of the vehicle, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that such vehicle either will be brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards or will be exported (at no cost to the United States) by the importer or the Secretary of Homeland Security or abandoned to the United States. However, if the Registered Importer has procured a continuous entry bond, it must furnish the Administrator with such bond, and must furnish the Secretary of Homeland Security (acting on behalf of the Administrator) with a paper or electronic copy, in a format accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, of such bond at the time of importation of each motor vehicle.\n",
              "(b) Establish, maintain, and retain, for 10 years from the date of entry, at the facility in the United States it has identified in its application pursuant to § 592.5 (a)(5)(i), for each motor vehicle for which it furnishes a certificate of conformity, the following records, including correspondence and other documents, in hard copy format:\n",
              "(1) The declaration required by § 591.5 of this chapter.\n",
              "(2) All vehicle or equipment purchase or sales orders or agreements, conformance agreements between the Registered Importer and persons who import motor vehicles for personal use, and correspondence between the Registered Importer and the owner or purchaser of the vehicle.\n",
              "(3) The make, model, model year, odometer reading, and VIN of each vehicle that it imports and the last known name and address of the owner or purchaser of the vehicle.\n",
              "(4) Records, including photographs and other documents, sufficient to identify the vehicle and to substantiate that it has been brought into conformity with all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, that the certification label has been affixed, and that either the vehicle is not subject to any safety recalls or that all noncompliances and safety defects covered by such recalls were remedied before the submission to the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this section. All photographs submitted shall be unaltered.\n",
              "(5) A copy of the certification submitted to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.\n",

              "(d) For each motor vehicle imported pursuant to part 591.5(f) of this chapter, certify to the Administrator:\n",
              "(1) Within 120 days of the importation that it has brought the motor vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured by the fabricating manufacturer. Such certification shall state verbatim either that “I know that the vehicle that I am certifying conforms with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards because I personally witnessed each modification performed on the vehicle to effect compliance,” or that “I know that the vehicle I am certifying conforms with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards because the person who performed the necessary modifications to the vehicle is an employee of [RI name] and has provided full documentation of the work that I have reviewed, and I am satisfied that the vehicle as modified complies.” The Registered Importer shall also certify that it has destroyed or exported any noncompliant motor vehicle equipment items that were removed from an imported vehicle in the course of performing conformance modifications. The Registered Importer shall also certify, as appropriate, that either:\n",
              "(i) The vehicle is not required to comply with the parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard (part 541 of this chapter); or\n",

              "(2) If the Registered Importer certifies that the vehicle was originally manufactured to comply with a standard that does not apply to the vehicle or that it has modified the vehicle to conform to such standard, or if the certification is incomplete, the Administrator may refuse to accept the certification. The Administrator shall refuse to accept a certification for a vehicle that has not been determined to be eligible for importation under part 593 of this chapter. If the Administrator does not accept a submission, (s)he shall return it to the Registered Importer. The costs associated with such a return will be charged to the Registered Importer. If the Administrator returns the submission as described above and the vehicle is eligible for importation, the 120-day period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section continues to run, but the 30-day period specified in paragraph (f) of this section does not begin to run until the Administrator has accepted the submission. If the vehicle is not eligible for importation, the importer must export it from, or abandon it to, the United States. If the Registered Importer certifies that it has modified the vehicle to bring it into compliance with a standard and has, in fact, not performed all required modifications, the Administrator will regard such certification as “knowingly false” within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 30115 and 49 U.S.C. 30141(c)(4)(B).\n",
              "(3) The certification must be signed and submitted by a principal of the Registered Importer designated in its registration application pursuant to § 592.5(a)(5)(iv), with an original hand-written signature and not with a signature that is stamped or mechanically applied.\n",
              "(4) The certification to the Administrator must specify the location of the facility where the vehicle was conformed, and the location where the Administrator may inspect the motor vehicle.\n",
              "(5) The certification to the Administrator must state and contain substantiation either that the vehicle is not subject to any safety recalls as of the time of such certification, or, alternatively, that all noncompliances and defects that are the subject of those safety recalls have been remedied.\n",

              "(iii) A copy of the bond given at the time of entry to ensure conformance with the safety and bumper standards,\n",
              "(iv) The vehicle's vehicle eligibility number, as stated in appendix A to part 593 of this chapter,\n",
              "(v) A copy of the HS-7 Declaration form executed at the time of its importation if a Customs broker did not make an electronic entry for the vehicle with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection,\n",
              "(vi) Unaltered front, side, and rear photographs of the vehicle,\n",
              "(vii) Unaltered photographs of the original manufacturer's certification label and the certification label of the Registered Importer affixed to the vehicle (and, if the vehicle is a motorcycle, a photograph or photocopy of the Registered Importer certification label before it has been affixed),\n",
              "(viii) Unaltered photographs and documentation sufficient to demonstrate conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards to which the vehicle was not originally manufactured to conform,\n",

              "(7) Except as specified in this paragraph, a Registered Importer's second and subsequent certification submissions for a given make, model, and model year vehicle must contain the information required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If the Registered Importer conformed such a vehicle in the same manner as it stated in its initial certification submission, it may say so in a subsequent submission and it need not provide the description required by paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section.\n",
              "(e) With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports, not take any of the following actions until the bond referred to in paragraph (a) of this section has been released, unless 30 days have elapsed from the date the Administrator receives the Registered Importer's certification of compliance of the motor vehicle in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section (the 30-day period will be extended if the Administrator has made written demand to inspect the motor vehicle):\n",

              "(5) Release custody of the motor vehicle to a person for sale, or for license or registration for use on public streets, roads, and highways, or for titling in a name other than that of the Registered Importer who imported the vehicle.\n",
              "(f) Furnish with each motor vehicle for which it furnishes certification or information to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, not later than the time it sells the vehicle, or releases custody of a vehicle to an owner who has imported it for personal use, a service insurance policy written or underwritten by an independent insurance company, in the amount of $2,000. The Registered Importer shall provide the insurance company with a monthly list of the VINs of vehicles covered by the policies of the insurance company, and shall retain a copy of each such list in its files.\n",

However, this obligation does not exist if the manufacturer of the vehicle or the Registered Importer of such vehicle demonstrates to the Administrator that the defect or noncompliance is not present in such vehicle, or that the defect or noncompliance was remedied before the submission of the certificate or the information to the Administrator, or that the original manufacturer of the vehicle will provide such notification and remedy.\n",

              "(5) Except as provided in this paragraph, instead of the six quarterly reports required by § 573.7(a) of this chapter, the Registered Importer must submit to the Administrator two reports containing the information specified in § 573.7(b)(1) through (4) of this chapter. The reports shall cover the periods ending nine and 18 months after the commencement of the owner notification campaign, and must be submitted within 30 days of the end of each period.

                  "(b)(1) The dealer or motor vehicle repair business receives from the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle a letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that authorizes the installation of an on-off switch in that vehicle for that air bag and includes a form to be filled in by the dealer or motor vehicle repair business with information identifying itself and describing the installation it makes. \n",
                  "(2) The dealer or motor vehicle repair business installs the on-off switch in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer of the switch. \n",
                  "(3) The on-off switch meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.\n",
                  "(i) The on-off switch is operable solely by a key or a key-like object. The on-off switch shall be separate from the ignition switch for the vehicle, so that the driver must take some action other than inserting the ignition key or turning the ignition key in the ignition switch to turn off the air bag. Once turned off, the air bag shall remain off until it is turned back on by means of the device. If a single on-off switch is installed for both air bags, the on-off switch shall allow each air bag to be turned off without turning off the other air bag. The readiness indicator required by S4.5.2 of § 571.208 of this chapter shall continue to monitor the readiness of the air bags even when one or both air bags has been turned off. The readiness indicator light shall not be illuminated solely because an air bag has been deactivated by means of an on-off switch.\n",
                  "(ii) A telltale light in the interior of the vehicle shall be illuminated whenever the driver or passenger air bag is turned off by means of the on-off switch. The telltale for a driver air bag shall be clearly visible to an occupant of the driver's seating position. The telltale for a passenger air bag shall be clearly visible to occupants of all front seating positions. The telltale for an air bag: \n",
                  "(A) Shall be yellow;\n",
                  "(B) Shall have the identifying words “DRIVER AIR BAG OFF”, “PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF”, or “PASS AIR BAG OFF”, as appropriate, on the telltale or within 25 millimeters of the telltale; \n",
                  "(C) Shall remain illuminated for the entire time that the air bag is “off;”\n",
                  "(D) Shall not be illuminated at any time when the air bag is “on;” and,\n",
                  "(E) Shall not be combined with the readiness indicator required by S4.5.2 of § 571.208 of this chapter. \n",

                  "(ii) Lists the risk groups on the request form set forth in appendix B of this Part,\n",
                  "(iii) States that an on-off switch should only be used to turn off an air bag for a member of one of those risk groups, and \n",
                  "(iv) States the safety consequences for using the on-off switch to turn off an air bag for persons who are not members of any of those risk groups. The description of those consequences includes information, specific to the make, model and model year of the owner's or lessee's vehicle, about any seat belt energy managing features, e.g., load limiters, that will affect seat belt performance when the air bag is turned off. \n",
                  "(5) In the form included in the agency authorization letter specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the dealer or motor vehicle repair business fills in information describing itself and the on-off switch installation(s) it makes in the motor vehicle. The dealer or motor vehicle repair business then sends the form to the address below within 7 working days after the completion of the described installations: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Attention: Air Bag Switch Request Forms, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590-1000.\n"
