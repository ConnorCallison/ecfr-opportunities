      Complaints Filed at the Local and State Level

        § 658.410   Establishment of local and State complaint systems.

#### § § 658.410

        (a) Each State Workforce Agency (SWA) must establish and maintain a Complaint System pursuant to this subpart.

        (b) The State Administrator must have overall responsibility for the operation of the Complaint System; this includes responsibility for the informal resolution of complaints. In the ES office, the ES Office Manager is responsible for the operation of the Complaint System.

        (c) SWAs must ensure centralized control procedures are established for the processing of complaints and apparent violations. The ES Office Manager and the State Administrator must ensure a central complaint log is maintained, listing all complaints taken by the ES office or the SWA and apparent violations identified by ES staff, and specifying for each complaint or apparent violation:

        (1) The name of the complainant (for complaints);

        (2) The name of the respondent (employer or State agency);

        (3) The date the complaint is filed or the apparent violation was identified;

        (4) Whether the complaint is made by or on behalf of a migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSFW) or whether the apparent violation affects an MSFW;

        (5) Whether the complaint or apparent violation concerns an employment-related law or the ES regulations; and

        (6) The actions taken (including any documents the SWA sent or received and the date the SWA took such action(s)), and whether the complaint or apparent violation has been resolved, including informally.

        (d) State agencies must ensure information pertaining to the use of the Complaint System is publicized, which must include, but is not limited to, the prominent display of an Employment and Training Administration (ETA)-approved Complaint System poster in each one-stop center.

        (e) Each one-stop center must ensure there is appropriate staff available during regular office hours to take complaints.

        (f) Complaints may be accepted in any one-stop center, or by a SWA, or elsewhere by outreach staff.

        (g) All complaints filed through the ES office must be processed by a trained Complaint System Representative.

        (h) All complaints received by a SWA must be assigned to a trained Complaint System Representative designated by the State Administrator. Complaints must not be assigned to the State Monitor Advocate (SMA).

        (i) State agencies must ensure any action taken by the Complaint System Representative, including referral on a complaint from an MSFW, is fully documented and contains all relevant information, including a notation of the type of each complaint pursuant to Department guidance, a copy of the original complaint form, a copy of any ES-related reports, any relevant correspondence, a list of actions taken, a record of pertinent telephone calls, and all correspondence relating thereto.

        (j) Within 1 month after the end of the calendar quarter, the ES office manager must transmit an electronic copy of the quarterly Complaint System log described in paragraph (c) of this section to the SMA. These logs must be made available to the Department upon request.

        (k) The appropriate ES staff processing a complaint must offer to assist the complainant through the provision of appropriate services.

        (l) The State Administrator must establish a referral system for cases where a complaint is filed alleging a violation that occurred in the same State but through a different ES office.

        (m) Follow-up on unresolved complaints. When an MSFW submits a complaint, the Complaint System Representative must follow up monthly on the processing of the complaint and must inform the complainant of the status of the complaint. No follow-up with the complainant is required for non-MSFW complaints.

        (n) A complainant may designate an individual to act as their representative throughout the filing and processing of a complaint.

        § 658.411   Action on complaints.

#### § § 658.411

        (a)

        (1) Whenever an individual indicates an interest in filing a complaint under this subpart with an ES office, the SWA, or outreach staff, the individual receiving the complaint must offer to explain the operation of the Complaint System and must offer to take the complaint in writing.

        (2) During the initial discussion with the complainant, the staff taking the complaint must:

        (i) Make every effort to obtain all the information they perceive to be necessary to investigate the complaint;

        (ii) Request that the complainant indicate all of the physical addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and any other helpful means by which they might be contacted during the investigation of the complaint; and

        (iii) Request that the complainant contact the Complaint System Representative before leaving the area if possible, and explain the need to maintain contact during the investigation.

        (3) The staff must ensure the complainant (or their representative) submits the complaint on the Complaint/Referral Form or another complaint form prescribed or approved by the Department or submits complaint information which satisfies paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The Complaint/Referral Form must be used for all complaints, including complaints about unlawful discrimination, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The staff must offer to assist the complainant in filling out the form and submitting all necessary information and must do so if the complainant desires such assistance. If the complainant also represents several other complainants, all such complainants must be named. The complainant, or their representative, must sign the completed form in writing or electronically. The identity of the complainant(s) and any persons who furnish information relating to, or assisting in, an investigation of a complaint must be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable law and a fair determination of the complaint. A copy of the completed complaint submission must be given to the complainant(s), and the complaint form must be given to the appropriate Complaint System Representative described in § 658.410(g).

        (4) Any complaint in a reasonable form (letter or email) which is signed by the complainant, or their representative, and includes sufficient information to initiate an investigation must be treated as if it were a properly completed Complaint/Referral Form filed in person.  A letter (via hard copy or email) confirming the complaint was received must be sent to the complainant and the document must be sent to the appropriate Complaint System Representative. The Complaint System Representative must request additional information from the complainant if the complainant has not provided sufficient information to investigate the matter expeditiously.

        (b)  (1) When a complaint is filed regarding an employment-related law with an ES office or a SWA, and paragraph (c) of this section does not apply, the office must determine if the complainant is an MSFW.

        (i) If the complainant is a non-MSFW, the office must immediately refer the complainant to the appropriate enforcement agency, another public agency, a legal aid organization, and/or a consumer advocate organization, as appropriate, for assistance. Upon completing the referral, the local or State representative is not required to follow up with the complainant.

        (ii) If the complainant is a MSFW, the ES office or SWA Complaint System Representative must:

        (A) Take from the MSFW or their representative, in writing (hard copy or electronic), the complaint(s) describing the alleged violation(s) of the employment-related law(s); and

        (B) Attempt to resolve the issue informally at the local level, except in cases where the complaint was submitted to the SWA and the Complaint System Representative determines that they must take immediate action or in cases where informal resolution at the local level would be detrimental to the complainant(s). In cases where informal resolution at the local level would be detrimental to the complainant(s), the Complaint System Representative must immediately refer the complaint to the appropriate enforcement agency. Concurrently, the Complaint System Representative must offer to refer the MSFW to other ES services should the MSFW be interested.

        (C) If the issue is not resolved within 5 business days, the Complaint System Representative must refer the complaint to the appropriate enforcement agency (or another public agency, a legal aid organization, or a consumer advocate organization, as appropriate) for further assistance.

        (D) If the ES office or SWA Complaint System Representative determines that the complaint must be referred to a State or Federal agency, they must refer the complaint immediately to the appropriate enforcement agency for prompt action.

        (E) If the complaint was referred under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, the representative must notify the complainant of the enforcement agency to which the complaint was referred.

        (F) When a complaint alleges an employer in a different State from where the complaint is filed has violated an employment-related law:

        () The ES office or SWA receiving the complaint must ensure the Complaint/Referral Form is adequately completed and then immediately send a copy of the Complaint/Referral Form and copies of any relevant documents to the SWA in the other State. Copies of the referral letter must be sent to the complainant, and copies of the complaint and referral letter must be sent to the ETA Regional Office(s) with jurisdiction over the transferring and receiving State agencies. All such copies must be sent via hard copy or electronic mail.

        () The SWA receiving the complaint must process the complaint as if it had been initially filed with that SWA.

        () The ETA Regional Office with jurisdiction over the receiving SWA must follow up with it to ensure the complaint is processed in accordance with these regulations.

        (2) If an enforcement agency makes a final determination that the employer violated an employment-related law and the complaint is connected to a job order, the SWA must initiate procedures for discontinuation of services immediately in accordance with subpart F of this part. If this occurs, the SWA must notify the complainant and the employer of this action.

        (c)  All complaints received under this subpart by an ES office or a SWA alleging unlawful discrimination or reprisal for protected activity in violation of nondiscrimination laws, such as those enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Department of Labor's Civil Rights Center (CRC), or in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act's anti-discrimination provision found at 8 U.S.C. 1324b, must be logged and immediately referred to the State-level E.O. Officer. The Complaint System Representative must notify the complainant of the referral in writing.

        (2) Any complaints received either at the local and State level or at the ETA regional office, that allege violations of civil rights laws and regulations such as those under title VI of the Civil Rights Act or sec. 188 of WIOA, including for beneficiaries (as defined in 29 CFR 38.4) only, on the basis of citizenship status or participant status, as well as reprisal for protected activity, must immediately be logged and directed or forwarded to the recipient's Equal Opportunity Officer or the CRC.

        (i) When an ES complaint is filed against an employer, the proper office to process the complaint is the ES office serving the area in which the employer is located.

        (ii) When a complaint is against an employer in another State or against another SWA:

        (A) The ES office or SWA receiving the complaint must ensure the Complaint/Referral Form is adequately completed, and then immediately send a copy of the Complaint/Referral Form and copies of any relevant documents to the SWA in the other State. Copies of the referral letter must be sent to the complainant, and copies of the complaint and referral letter must be sent to the ETA Regional Office(s) with jurisdiction over the transferring and receiving State agencies. All such copies must be sent via hard copy or electronic mail.

        (B) The SWA receiving the complaint must process the complaint as if it had been initially filed with that SWA.

        (C) The ETA Regional Office with jurisdiction over the receiving SWA must follow up with it to ensure the complaint is processed in accordance with these regulations.

        (D) If the complaint is against more than one SWA, the complaint must so clearly state. Additionally, the complaints must be processed as separate complaints and must be processed according to procedures in this paragraph (d).

        (iii) When an ES complaint is filed against an ES office, the proper office to process the complaint is the ES office serving the area in which the alleged violation occurred.

        (iv) When an ES complaint is filed against more than one ES offices and is in regard to an alleged agency-wide violation, the SWA representative or their designee must process the complaint.

        (v) When a complaint is filed alleging a violation that occurred in the same State but through a different ES office, the ES office where the complaint is filed must ensure that the Complaint/Referral Form is adequately completed and send the form to the appropriate local ES office for tracking, further referral if necessary, and follow-up. A copy of the referral letter must be sent to the complainant via hard copy or electronic mail.

        (2)(i) If a complaint regarding an alleged violation of the ES regulations is filed in a ES office by either a non-MSFW or MSFW, or their representative(s) (or if all necessary information has been submitted to the office pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section), the appropriate ES office Complaint System Representative must investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint immediately upon receipt.

        (ii) If resolution has not been achieved to the satisfaction of the complainant within 15 working days after receipt of the complaint, or 5 working days with respect to complaints filed by or on behalf of MSFWs, (or after all necessary information has been submitted to the ES office pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section), the Complaint System Representative must send the complaint to the SWA for resolution or further action.

        (iii) The ES office must notify the complainant and the respondent, in writing (via hard copy or electronic mail), of the determination (pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section) of its investigation under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or of the referral to the SWA (if referred).

        (3) When a non-MSFW or their representative files a complaint regarding the ES regulations with a SWA, or when a non-MSFW complaint is referred from an ES office the following procedures apply:

        (i) If the complaint is not transferred to an enforcement agency under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the Complaint System Representative must investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint immediately upon receipt.

        (ii) If resolution at the SWA level has not been accomplished within 30 working days after the complaint was received by the SWA (or after all necessary information has been submitted to the SWA pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section), whether the complaint was received directly or from an ES office pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the SWA official must make a written determination regarding the complaint and must send electronic copies to the complainant and the respondent. The determination must follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

        (4)(i) When a MSFW or their representative files a complaint regarding the ES regulations directly with a SWA, or when a MSFW complaint is referred from an ES office, the Complaint System Representative must investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint immediately upon receipt and may, if necessary, conduct a further investigation.

        § 658.417   State hearings.

#### § § 658.417

        (a) The hearing described in § 658.411(d)(5) must be held by State hearing officials. A State hearing official may be any State official authorized to hold hearings under State law. Examples of hearing officials are referees in State unemployment compensation hearings and officials of the State agency authorized to preside at State administrative hearings.

        (b) The State hearing official may decide to conduct hearings on more than one complaint concurrently if they determine that the issues are related or that the complaints will be processed more expeditiously if conducted together.

        (c) The State hearing official, upon the referral of a case for a hearing, must:

        (1) Notify all involved parties of the date, time, and place of the hearing; and

        (2) Reschedule the hearing, as appropriate.

        (d) In conducting a hearing, the State hearing official must:

        (1) Regulate the course of the hearing;

        (2) Issue subpoenas if necessary, provided the official has the authority to do so under State law;

        (3) Ensure that all relevant issues are considered;

        (4) Rule on the introduction of evidence and testimony; and

        (5) Take all actions necessary to ensure an orderly proceeding.

        (e) All testimony at the hearing must be recorded and may be transcribed when appropriate.

        (f) The parties must be afforded the opportunity to present, examine, and cross-examine witnesses.

        (g) The State hearing official may elicit testimony from witnesses, but may not act as advocate for any party.

        (h) The State hearing official must receive and include in the record, documentary evidence offered by any party and accepted at the hearing. Copies thereof must be made available by the party submitting the document to other parties to the hearing upon request.

        (i) Federal and State rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this section; however rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination, must be applied where reasonably necessary by the State hearing official. The State hearing official may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

        (j) The case record, or any portion thereof, must be available for inspection and copying by any party at, prior to, or subsequent to the hearing upon request. Special procedures may be used for disclosure of medical and psychological records such as disclosure to a physician designated by the individual.

        (k) The State hearing official must, if feasible, resolve the dispute at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing.

        (l) At the State hearing official's discretion, other appropriate individuals, organizations, or associations may be permitted to participate in the hearing as amicus curiae (friends of the court) with respect to any legal or factual issues relevant to the complaint. Any documents submitted by the amicus curiae must be included in the record.

        (m) If the parties to the hearing are located in more than one State or are located in the same State but access to the hearing location is extremely inconvenient for one or more parties as determined by the State hearing official, the hearing official must:

        (1) Whenever possible, hold a single hearing at a location convenient to all parties or their representatives wishing to appear and present evidence, with all such parties and/or their representatives present.

        (2) If a hearing location cannot be established by the State hearing official under paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the State hearing official may conduct, with the consent of the parties, the hearing by a telephone conference call from a State agency office. If the hearing is conducted via telephone conference call the parties and their representatives must have the option to participate in person or via telephone.

        (3) Where the State agency is not able, for any reason, to conduct a telephonic hearing under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the State agencies in the States where the parties are located must take evidence and hold the hearing in the same manner as used for appealed interstate unemployment claims in those States, to the extent that such procedures are consistent with this section.

        (4) Render such other rulings as are appropriate to resolve the issues in question.

        However, the State hearing official does not have authority or jurisdiction to consider the validity or constitutionality of the ES regulations or of the Federal statutes under which they are promulgated.

The notification to the complainant and respondent must be sent by certified mail or by other legally viable means.

        (c) All decisions of a State hearing official must be accompanied by a written notice informing the parties (not including the Regional Administrator, the Solicitor of Labor, or entities serving in an amicus capacity) that they may appeal the judge's decision within 20 working days of the certified date of receipt of the decision, and they may file an appeal in writing with the Regional Administrator. The notice must give the address of the Regional Administrator.

        § 658.419   Apparent violations.

#### § § 658.419

#### § § 658.420

        (a) Each Regional Administrator must establish and maintain a Complaint System within each ETA regional office.

        (b) The Regional Administrator must designate Department of Labor officials to process ES regulation-related complaints as follows:

        (1) All complaints received at the ETA regional office under this subpart that allege unlawful discrimination or reprisal for protected activity in violation of nondiscrimination laws, such as those enforced by the EEOC or CRC, or in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act's anti-discrimination provision found at 8 U.S.C. 1324b, must be logged and immediately referred to the appropriate State-level E.O. Officer(s).

        (2) All complaints other than those described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be assigned to a regional office official designated by the Regional Administrator, provided that the regional office official designated to process MSFW complaints must be the Regional Monitor Advocate (RMA).

        (c) Except for those complaints under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Administrator must designate Department of Labor officials to process employment-related law complaints in accordance with § 658.422, provided that the regional official designated to process MSFW employment-related law complaints must be the RMA.

        § 658.421   Processing of Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service regulation-related complaints.

#### § § 658.421

        (a)(1) Except as provided below in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no complaint alleging a violation of the ES regulations may be processed at the ETA regional office level until the complainant has exhausted the SWA administrative remedies set forth at §§ 658.411 through 658.418. If the Regional Administrator determines that a complaint has been prematurely filed with an ETA regional office, the Regional Administrator must inform the complainant within 10 working days in writing that the complainant must first exhaust those remedies before the complaint may be filed in the regional office. A copy of this letter and a copy of the complaint also must be sent to the State Administrator.

        (2) If a complaint is submitted directly to the Regional Administrator and if they determine that the nature and scope of a complaint described in paragraph (a) of this section is such that the time required to exhaust the administrative procedures at the SWA level would adversely affect a significant number of individuals, the RA must accept the complaint and take the following action:

        (i) If the complaint is filed against an employer, the regional office must process the complaint in a manner consistent with the requirements imposed upon State agencies by §§ 658.411 and 658.418.   A hearing must be offered to the parties once the Regional Administrator makes a determination on the complaint.

        (ii) If the complaint is filed against a SWA, the regional office must follow procedures established at § 658.411(d).

        (b) The ETA regional office is responsible for processing appeals of determinations made on complaints at the SWA level. An appeal includes any letter or other writing which the Regional Administrator reasonably understands to be requesting review if it is received by the regional office and signed by a party to the complaint.

        (c)(1) Once the Regional Administrator receives a timely appeal, they must request the complete SWA file, including the original Complaint/Referral Form from the appropriate SWA.

        (2) The Regional Administrator must review the file in the case and must determine within 10 business days whether any further investigation or action is appropriate; however, if the Regional Administrator determines that they need to request legal advice from the Office of the Solicitor at the U.S. Department of Labor, then the Regional Administrator is allowed 20 business days to make this determination.

        (d) If the Regional Administrator determines that no further action is warranted, the Regional Administrator will send their determination in writing to the appellant within 5 days of the determination, with a notification that the appellant may request a hearing before a Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) by filing a hearing request in writing with the Regional Administrator within 20 working days of the appellant's receipt of the notification.

        (e) If the Regional Administrator determines that further investigation or other action is warranted, the Regional Administrator must undertake such an investigation or other action necessary to resolve the complaint.

        (f) After taking the actions described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Regional Administrator must either affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the State hearing official, and must notify each party to the State hearing official's hearing or to whom the State office determination was sent, notice of the determination and notify the parties that they may appeal the determination to the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges within 20 business days of the party's receipt of the notice.

        (g) If the Regional Administrator finds reason to believe that a SWA or one of its ES offices has violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must follow the procedures set forth at subpart H of this part.

After conferring all the parties, the ALJ may decide to make a determination on the record in lieu of scheduling a hearing.

        (d) The ALJ may decide to consolidate cases and conduct hearings on more than one complaint concurrently if they determine that the issues are related or that the complaints will be processed more expeditiously.

        (e) If the parties to the hearing are located in more than one State or are located in the same State but access to the hearing location is extremely inconvenient for one or more parties as determined by the ALJ, the ALJ must:

The ALJ may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

        (j) The case record, or any portion thereof, must be available for inspection and copying by any party to the hearing at, prior to, or subsequent to the hearing upon request.

#### § § 658.400

      (a) This subpart sets forth the regulations governing the Complaint System for the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) at the State and Federal levels.

    Subpart F—Discontinuation of Services to Employers by the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service

      § 658.500   Scope and purpose of subpart.

#### § § 658.500

      (a) This subpart contains the regulations governing the discontinuation of services provided by the ES to employers pursuant to parts 652 and 653 of this chapter.

      (b) For purposes of this subpart only, where the term “employer” is used, it refers to employers, agents, farm labor contractors, joint employers, and successors in interest to any employer, agent, farm labor contractor, or joint employer, as defined at § 651.10 of this chapter. A successor in interest to an employer, agent, or farm labor contractor may be held liable for the duties and obligations of that employer, agent, or farm labor contractor for purposes of recruitment of workers through the ES clearance system or enforcement of ES regulations, regardless of whether such successor in interest has succeeded to all the rights and liabilities of the predecessor entity.

> [89 FR 34065, Apr. 29, 2024]

      § 658.501   Basis for discontinuation of services.

#### § § 658.501

      (a) SWA officials must initiate procedures for discontinuation of services to employers who:

      (1) Submit and refuse to correct or withdraw job orders containing terms and conditions that are contrary to employment-related laws;

      (2) Submit job orders and refuse to provide assurances, or refuse to withdraw job orders that do not contain assurances, required pursuant to the Agricultural Recruitment System for U.S. Workers at part 653, subpart F, of this chapter;

      (3) Are found through field checks or otherwise to have either misrepresented the terms or conditions of employment specified on job orders or failed to comply fully with assurances made on job orders;

      (4) Are found by a final determination by an appropriate enforcement agency to have violated any employment-related laws and notification of this final determination has been provided to the Department or the SWA by that enforcement agency, including those who are currently debarred from participating in the H-2A or H-2B foreign labor certification programs pursuant to § 655.73 or § 655.182 of this chapter or 29 CFR 501.20 or 503.24;

      (5) Are found to have violated ES regulations pursuant to § 658.411 or § 658.419;

      (6) Refuse to accept qualified workers referred through the clearance system for criteria clearance orders filed pursuant to part 655, subpart B, of this chapter;

      (7) Refuse to cooperate in field checks conducted pursuant to § 653.503 of this chapter; or

      (8) Repeatedly cause the initiation of the procedures for discontinuation of services pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.

      (b) If an ES office or SWA has information that an employer participating in the ES may have committed fraud or misrepresentation in connection with its current or prior temporary labor certification or may not have complied with the terms of such certification, under, for example the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, SWA officials must notify the OFLC National Processing Center and the Wage and Hour Division of the alleged noncompliance as applicable under § 655.185 and 29 CFR 501.2, 501.6, 503.3, and 503.7. If the circumstances occurred within the previous 3 years, SWA officials must determine whether there is a basis under paragraph (a) of this section for which the SWA must initiate procedures for discontinuation of services.

      (c) [Reserved]

      § 658.502   Notification to employers of intent to discontinue services.

#### § § 658.502

If the SWA determines that the employer did not provide a satisfactory response in accordance with § 658.502(a), the SWA's notification must specify the reasons for its determination and state that the discontinuation of services is effective 20 working days from the date of the notification. The notification must also state that the employer may request reinstatement or appeal the determination by requesting a hearing pursuant to § 658.504, and that a request for a hearing stays the discontinuation pending the outcome of the hearing. If the employer does not request a hearing, the SWA must also notify the ETA Office of Workforce Investment of any final determination to discontinue ES services within 10 working days of the date the determination becomes effective.

      (b) Where the SWA discontinues services immediately under § 658.502(b), the SWA's written notification must specify the facts supporting the applicable basis for discontinuation under § 658.501(a), the reasons that exhaustion of the administrative procedures would cause substantial harm to workers, and that services are discontinued as of the date of the notification. The notification must also state that the employer may request reinstatement or appeal the determination by requesting a hearing pursuant to § 658.504, and that a request for a hearing relating to immediate discontinuation does not stay the discontinuation pending the outcome of the hearing. Within 10 working days of the date of issuance, the SWA must also notify the ETA Office of Workforce Investment of any determination to immediately discontinue ES services.

      (c) If the SWA discontinues services to an employer that is subject to Federal Contractor Job Listing Requirements, the SWA must notify the ETA regional office immediately.

      (d) If the SWA discontinues services to an employer based on a complaint filed pursuant to § 658.411, the SWA must notify the complainant of the employer's discontinuation of services.

      (e) If the SWA discontinues services to an employer, the employer cannot participate in or receive Wagner-Peyser Act ES Services provided by the ES, including by any SWA, to employers pursuant to parts 652 and 653 of this chapter. From the date of discontinuance, the SWA that issued the determination must remove the employer's active job orders from the clearance system. No SWA may process any future job orders from the employer or provide any other services pursuant to parts 652 and 653 of this chapter to the employer unless services have been reinstated under § 658.504.

      (f) SWAs must continue to provide the full range of ES and other appropriate services to workers whose employers experience discontinuation of services under this subpart.

      (b) If the employer submits a written request for reinstatement of services to the SWA:

      (1) Within 20 working days of receipt of the employer's request for reinstatement, the SWA must notify the employer of its decision to grant or deny the request. If the SWA denies the request for reinstatement, it must specify the reasons for the denial and notify the employer that it may request a hearing, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, within 20 working days.

      (2) The SWA must reinstate services if:

      (i) The employer provides adequate evidence that the policies, procedures, or conditions responsible for the previous discontinuation of services have been corrected and that the same or similar circumstances are not likely to occur in the future; and

      (ii) The employer provides adequate evidence that it has responded to all findings of an enforcement agency, SWA, or ETA, including payment of any fines or restitution to remediate the violation, that were the basis of the discontinuation of services, if applicable.

      (c) If the employer submits a timely request for a hearing:

      (1) The SWA must follow the procedures set forth in § 658.417; and

      (2) The SWA must reinstate services to the employer if ordered to do so by a State hearing official, Regional Administrator, or Federal Administrative Law Judge as a result of a hearing offered pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (d) Within 10 working days of the date of issuance, the SWA must notify the ETA Office of Workforce Investment of any determination to reinstate ES services, or any decision on appeal upholding a SWA's determination to discontinue services.

    Subpart G—Review and Assessment of State Workforce Agency Compliance With Employment Service Regulations

      § 658.600   Scope and purpose of subpart.

#### § § 658.600

      This subpart sets forth the regulations governing review and assessment of State Workforce Agency (SWA) compliance with the ES regulations at this part and parts 651, 652, 653, and 654 of this chapter. All recordkeeping and reporting requirements contained in this part and part 653 of this chapter have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

      § 658.601   State Workforce Agency responsibility.

#### § § 658.601

      (a) Each SWA must establish and maintain a self-appraisal system for ES operations to determine success in reaching goals and to correct deficiencies in performance. The self-appraisal system must include numerical (quantitative) appraisal and non-numerical (qualitative) appraisal.

      (1) Numerical appraisal at the ES office level must be conducted as follows:

      (i) Performance must be measured on a quarterly-basis against planned service levels as stated in the Unified or Combined State Plan (“State Plan”). The State Plan must be consistent with numerical goals contained in ES office plans.

      (ii) To appraise numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on the Department's ETA Form 9172, or any successor report required by the Department must be compared to planned levels. Differences between achievement and plan levels must be identified.

      (iii) When the numerical appraisal of required activities/indicators identifies significant differences from planned levels, additional analysis must be conducted to isolate possible contributing factors. This data analysis must include, as appropriate, comparisons to past performance, attainment of State Plan goals and consideration of pertinent non-numerical factors.

      (iv) Results of ES office numerical reviews must be documented and significant deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be developed to address these deficiencies.

      (v) The result of ES office appraisal, including corrective action plans, must be communicated in writing to the next higher level of authority for review. This review must cover adequacy of analysis, appropriateness of corrective actions, and need for higher level involvement. When this review is conducted at an area or district office, a report describing ES office performance within the area or district jurisdiction must be communicated to the SWA on a quarterly basis.

      (2) Numerical appraisal at the SWA level must be conducted as follows:

      (i) Performance must be measured on a quarterly basis against planned service levels as stated in the State Plan. The State Plan must be consistent with numerical goals contained in ES office plans.

      (ii) To appraise these key numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on ETA Form 9172, or any successor report required by the Department must be compared to planned levels. Differences between achievement and plan levels must be identified.

      (iii) The SWA must review statewide data and performance against planned service levels as stated in the State Plan on at least a quarterly basis to identify significant statewide deficiencies and to determine the need for additional analysis, including identification of trends, comparisons to past performance, and attainment of State Plan goals.

      § 658.604   Assessment and evaluation of program performance data.

#### § § 658.604

      (a) State Workforce Agencies must compile program performance data required by the Department, including statistical information on program operations.

      (b) The Department must use the program performance data in assessing and evaluating whether each SWA has complied with ES regulations and its State Plan.

      (c) In assessing and evaluating program performance data, the Department must act in accordance with the following general principles:

      (1) The fact that the program performance data from a SWA, whether overall or relative to a particular program activity, indicate poor program performance does not by itself constitute a violation of ES regulations or of the State Workforce Agency's responsibilities under its State Plan;

      (2) Program performance data, however, may so strongly indicate that a SWA's performance is so poor that the data may raise a presumption ( case) that a SWA is violating ES regulations or the State Plan. A SWA's failure to meet the operational objectives set forth in the State Plan raises a presumption that the agency is violating ES regulations and/or obligations under its State Plan. In such cases, the Department must afford the SWA an opportunity to rebut the presumption of a violation pursuant to the procedures at subpart H of this part.

      (3) The Department must take into account that certain program performance data may measure items over which SWAs have direct or substantial control while other data may measure items over which the SWA has indirect or minimal control.

      (i) Generally, for example, a SWA has direct and substantial control over the delivery of ES services such as referrals to jobs, job development contacts, counseling, referrals to career and supportive services, and the conduct of field checks.

      (ii) State Workforce Agencies, however, have only indirect control over the outcome of services. For example, SWAs cannot guarantee that an employer will hire a referred applicant, nor can they guarantee that the terms and conditions of employment will be as stated on a job order.

      (iii) Outside forces, such as a sudden heavy increase in unemployment rates, a strike by SWA employees, or a severe drought or flood, may skew the results measured by program performance data.

      (4) The Department must consider a SWA's failure to keep accurate and complete program performance data required by ES regulations as a violation of the ES regulations.

      § 658.605   Communication of findings to State agencies.

#### § § 658.605

      (a) The Regional Administrator must inform SWAs in writing of the results of review and assessment activities and, as appropriate, must discuss with the State Administrator the impact or action required by the Department as a result of review and assessment activities.

      (b) The ETA National Office must transmit the results of any review and assessment activities it conducted to the Regional Administrator who must send the information to the SWA.

      (c) Whenever the review and assessment indicates a SWA violation of ES regulations or its State Plan, the Regional Administrator must follow the procedures set forth at subpart H of this part.

      (d) Regional Administrators must follow-up any corrective action plan imposed on a SWA under subpart H of this part by further review and assessment of the State Workforce Agency pursuant to this subpart.

    Subpart H—Federal Application of Remedial Action to State Workforce Agencies

      § 658.700   Scope and purpose of subpart.

#### § § 658.700

      This subpart sets forth the procedures which the Department must follow upon either discovering independently or receiving from other(s) information indicating that SWAs may not be adhering to ES regulations.

      § 658.701   Statements of policy.

#### § § 658.701

      (a) It is the policy of the Department to take all necessary action, including the imposition of the full range of sanctions set forth in this subpart, to ensure State Workforce Agencies comply with all requirements established by ES regulations.

      (b) It is the policy of the Department to initiate decertification procedures against SWAs in instances of serious or continual violations of ES regulations if less stringent remedial actions taken in accordance with this subpart fail to resolve noncompliance.

      (c) It is the policy of the Department to act on information concerning alleged violations by SWAs of the ES regulations received from any person or organization.

      § 658.702   Initial action by the Regional Administrator.

#### § § 658.702

      (a) The ETA Regional Administrator is responsible for ensuring that all SWAs in their region are in compliance with ES regulations.

      (b) Wherever a Regional Administrator discovers or is apprised of possible SWA violations of ES regulations by the review and assessment activities under subpart G of this part, or through required reports or written complaints from individuals, organizations, or employers which are elevated to the Department after the exhaustion of SWA administrative remedies, the Regional Administrator must conduct an investigation. Within 10 business days after receipt of the report or other information, the Regional Administrator must make a determination whether there is probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations.

      (c) The Regional Administrator must accept complaints regarding possible SWA violations of ES regulations from employee organizations, employers or other groups, without exhaustion of the complaint process described at subpart E of this part, if the Regional Administrator determines that the nature and scope of the complaint are such that the time required to exhaust the administrative procedures at the State level would adversely affect a significant number of applicants. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must investigate the matter within 10 business days, may provide the SWA 10 business days for comment, and must make a determination within an additional 10 business days whether there is probable cause to believe that the SWA has violated ES regulations.

      (d) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is no probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations, they must retain all reports and supporting information in Department files. In all cases where the Regional Administrator has insufficient information to make a probable cause determination, they must so notify the Administrator in writing and the time for the investigation must be extended 20 additional business days.

      (e) If the Regional Administrator determines there is probable cause to believe a SWA has violated ES regulations, they must issue a Notice of Initial Findings of Non-compliance by registered mail (or other legally viable means) to the offending SWA. The notice will specify the nature of the violation, cite the regulations involved, and indicate corrective action which may be imposed in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. If the non-compliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to the NMA.

      (f)(1) The SWA may have 20 business days to comment on the findings, or up to 20 additional days, if the Regional Administrator determines a longer period is appropriate. The SWA's comments must include agreement or disagreement with the findings and suggested corrective actions, where appropriate.

      (2) After the period elapses, the Regional Administrator must prepare within 20 business days, written final findings which specify whether the SWA has violated ES regulations. If in the final findings the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has not violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must notify the State Administrator of this finding and retain supporting documents in their files. If the final finding involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator also must notify the RMA and the NMA. If the Regional Administrator determines a SWA has violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must prepare a Final Notice of Noncompliance which must specify the violation(s) and cite the regulations involved. The Final Notice of Noncompliance must be sent to the SWA by registered mail or other legally viable means. If the noncompliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of the Final Notice must be sent to the RMA and the NMA.

      (g) If the violation involves the misspending of grant funds, the Regional Administrator may order in the Final Notice of Noncompliance a disallowance of the expenditure and may either demand repayment or withhold future funds in the amount in question. If the Regional Administrator disallows costs, the Regional Administrator must give the reasons for the disallowance, inform the SWA that the disallowance is effective immediately and that no more funds may be spent in the disallowed manner, and offer the SWA the opportunity to request a hearing pursuant to § 658.707. The offer, or the acceptance of an offer of a hearing, however, does not stay the effectiveness of the disallowance. The Regional Administrator must keep complete records of the disallowance.

      (h) If the violation does not involve misspending of grant funds or the Regional Administrator determines that the circumstances warrant other action:

      (1) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must direct the SWA to implement a specific corrective action plan to correct all violations. If the SWA's comment demonstrates with supporting evidence (except where inappropriate) that all violations have already been corrected, the Regional Administrator need not impose a corrective action plan and instead may cite the violation(s) and accept the SWA's resolution, subject to follow-up review, if necessary. If the Regional Administrator determines that the violation(s) cited had been found previously and that the corrective action(s) taken had not corrected the violation(s) contrary to the findings of previous follow-up reviews, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.

      (2) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must specify the time by which each corrective action must be taken. This period may not exceed 40 business days unless the Regional Administrator determines that exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective actions requiring a longer time period. In such cases, and if the violations involve services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the exceptional circumstances which necessitate more time, and must specify the additional time period. The specified time must commence with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.

      (3) When the time provided for in paragraph (h)(2) of this section elapses, Department staff must review the SWA's efforts as documented by the SWA to determine if the corrective action(s) has been taken and if the SWA has achieved compliance with ES regulations. If necessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review.

      (4) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must record the basis for this determination, notify the SWA, send a copy to the Administrator, and retain a copy in Department files.

      (5) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has taken corrective action but is unable to determine if the violation has been corrected due to seasonality or other factors, the Regional Administrator must notify in writing the SWA and the Administrator of their findings. The Regional Administrator must conduct further follow-up at an appropriate time to make a final determination if the violation has been corrected. If the Regional Administrator's follow-up reveals that violations have not been corrected, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.

      (6) If, as a result of the review the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has not corrected the violations and has not made good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of the violations, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.

      (7) If, as a result of the review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has made good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of the violation and it appears the violation will be fully corrected within a reasonable amount of time, the SWA must be advised by registered mail or other legally viable means (with a copy sent to the Administrator) of this conclusion, of remaining differences, of further needed corrective action, and that all deficiencies must be corrected within a specified time period. This period may not exceed 40 business days unless the Regional Administrator determines exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective action requiring more time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the exceptional circumstances which necessitate more time, and must specify that time period. The specified time commences with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.

      (8)(i) If the SWA has been given additional time pursuant to paragraph (h)(7) of this section, Department staff must review the SWA's efforts as documented by the SWA at the end of the time period. If necessary, the Department must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review.

      (ii) If the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must document that finding, notify in writing the SWA and the Administrator, and retain supporting documents in Department files. If the SWA has not corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions pursuant to § 658.704.

In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate more time, and specify that time period. If necessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review. If the SWA is in compliance with the ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must fully document these facts and must terminate the remedial actions. The Regional Administrator must notify the SWA of their findings.

      (e) If, upon conducting the on-site review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds the SWA remains in noncompliance, the Regional Administrator must continue the remedial action and/or impose different additional remedial actions. The Regional Administrator must fully document all such decisions and, when the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, must send copies to the Administrator, who must promptly publish the notice in the .

      (f)(1) If the SWA has not brought itself into compliance with ES regulations within 120 business days of the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator must initiate decertification unless the Regional Administrator determines the circumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for more time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate the extended time, and specify the time period.

      § 661.100   What is the workforce investment system?

#### § § 661.100

      Under title I of WIA, the workforce investment system provides the framework for delivery of workforce investment activities at the State and local levels to individuals who need those services, including job seekers, dislocated workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce, veterans, persons with disabilities, and employers. Each State's Governor is required, in accordance with the requirements of this part, to establish a State Board; to designate local workforce investment areas; and to oversee the creation of Local Boards and One-Stop service delivery systems in the State.

      § 661.110   What is the role of the Department of Labor as the Federal governmental partner in the governance of the workforce investment system?

#### § § 661.110

      (a) Successful governance of the workforce investment system will be achieved through cooperation and coordination of Federal, State and local governments.

      (b) The Department of Labor sees as one of its primary roles providing leadership and guidance to support a system that meets the objectives of title I of WIA, and in which State and local partners have flexibility to design systems and deliver services in a manner designed to best achieve the goals of WIA based on their particular needs. The WIA regulations provide the framework in which State and local officials can exercise such flexibility within the confines of the statutory requirements. Wherever possible, system features such as design options and categories of services are broadly defined, and are subject to State and local interpretation.

      (c) The Secretary, in consultation with other Federal Agencies, as appropriate, may publish guidance on interpretations of statutory and regulatory provisions. State and local policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions that are consistent with interpretations contained in such guidance will be considered to be consistent with the Act for purposes of § 661.120.

      § 661.120   What are the roles of the local and State governmental partner in the governance of the workforce investment system?

#### § § 661.120

      (a) Local areas should establish policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions to implement provisions of title I of WIA to the extent that such policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions are not inconsistent with the Act and the regulations issued under the Act, Federal statutes and regulations governing One-Stop partner programs, and with State policies.

      (b) States should establish policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions to implement provisions of title I of WIA to the extent that such policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions are not inconsistent with the Act and the regulations issued under the Act, as well as Federal statutes and regulations governing One-Stop partner programs.

      (2) Review of local plans;

      (c) Commenting at least once annually on the measures taken under section 113(b)(14) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act;

      § 661.207   How does the State Board meet its requirement to conduct business in an open manner under the “sunshine provision” of WIA section 111(g)?

#### § § 661.207

      The State Board must conduct its business in an open manner as required by WIA section 111(g), by making available to the public, on a regular basis through open meetings, information about the activities of the State Board. This includes information about the State Plan prior to submission of the plan; information about membership; the development of significant policies, interpretations, guidelines and definitions; and, on request, minutes of formal meetings of the State Board.

      § 661.210   Under what circumstances may the Governor select an alternative entity in place of the State Workforce Investment Board?

#### § § 661.210

      (a) The State may use any State entity that meets the requirements of WIA section 111(e) to perform the functions of the State Board.

      (b) If the State uses an alternative entity, the State workforce investment plan must demonstrate that the alternative entity meets all three of the requirements of WIA section 111(e). Section 111(e) requires that such entity:

      (1) Was in existence on December 31, 1997;

      (2)(i) Was established under section 122 (relating to State Job Training Coordinating Councils) or title VII (relating to State Human Resource Investment Councils) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C.1501 ), as in effect on December 31, 1997, or

      (ii) Is substantially similar to the State Board described in WIA section 111(a), (b), and (c) and § 661.200; and

      (3) Includes, at a minimum, two or more representatives of business in the State and two or more representatives of labor organizations in the State.

      (c) If the alternative entity does not provide for representative membership of each of the categories of required State Board membership under WIA section 111(b), the State Plan must explain the manner in which the State will ensure an ongoing role for any unrepresented membership group in the workforce investment system. The State Board may maintain an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the State Plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups.

      (d) If the membership structure of the alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the State Board. In such case, the Governor must establish a new State Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 111(b).

      (e) A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-voting members are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.

      (f) In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the State Board also apply to an alternative entity used by a State.

      § 661.220   What are the requirements for the submission of the State Workforce Investment Plan?

#### § § 661.220

      (a) The Governor of each State must submit a State Workforce Investment Plan (State Plan) in order to be eligible to receive funding under title I of WIA and the Wagner-Peyser Act. The State Plan must outline the State's five year strategy for the workforce investment system.

      (b) The State Plan must be submitted in accordance with planning guidelines issued by the Secretary of Labor. The planning guidelines set forth the information necessary to document the State's vision, goals, strategies, policies and measures for the workforce investment system (that were arrived at through the collaboration of the Governor, chief elected officials, business and other parties), as well as the information required to demonstrate compliance with WIA, and the information detailed by WIA and the WIA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37, and the Wagner-Peyser Act and the Wagner-Peyser regulations at 20 CFR part 652:

      (c) The State Plan must contain a description of the State's performance accountability system, and the State performance measures in accordance with the requirements of WIA section 136 and 20 CFR part 666.

      (d) The State must provide an opportunity for public comment on and input into the development of the State Plan prior to its submission. The opportunity for public comment must include an opportunity for comment by representatives of business, representatives of labor organizations, and chief elected official(s) and must be consistent with the requirement, at WIA section 111(g), that the State Board makes information regarding the State Plan and other State Board activities available to the public through regular open meetings. The State Plan must describe the State's process and timeline for ensuring a meaningful opportunity for public comment.

      (e) The Secretary reviews completed plans and must approve all plans within ninety days of their submission, unless the Secretary determines in writing that:

      (1) The plan is inconsistent with the provisions of title I of WIA or the WIA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37. For example, a finding of inconsistency would be made if the Secretary and the Governor have not reached agreement on the adjusted levels of performance under WIA section 136(b)(3)(A), or there is not an effective strategy in place to ensure development of a fully operational One-Stop delivery system in the State; or

      (2) The portion of the plan describing the detailed Wagner-Peyser plan does not satisfy the criteria for approval of such plans as provided in section 8(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act or the Wagner-Peyser regulations at 20 CFR part 652.

      (3) A plan which is incomplete, or which does not contain sufficient information to determine whether it is consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of title I of WIA or of section 8(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, will be considered to be inconsistent with those requirements.

      § 661.230   What are the requirements for modification of the State Workforce Investment Plan?

#### § § 661.230

      (a) The State may submit a modification of its workforce investment plan at any time during the five-year life of the plan.

      (b) Modifications are required when:

      (1) Changes in Federal or State law or policy substantially change the assumptions upon which the plan is based.

      (2) There are changes in the Statewide vision, strategies, policies, performance indicators, the methodology used to determine local allocation of funds, reorganizations which change the working relationship with system employees, changes in organizational responsibilities, changes to the membership structure of the State Board or alternative entity and similar substantial changes to the State's workforce investment system.

      (3) The State has failed to meet performance goals, and must adjust service strategies.

      (c) Modifications are required in accordance with the Wagner-Peyser provisions at 20 CFR 652.212.

      (d) Modifications to the State Plan are subject to the same public review and comment requirements that apply to the development of the original State Plan.

      (e) State Plan modifications will be approved by the Secretary based on the approval standard applicable to the original State Plan under § 661.220(e).

      § 661.240   How do the unified planning requirements apply to the five-year strategic WIA and Wagner-Peyser plan and to other Department of Labor plans?

#### § § 661.240

      (1) A State may submit, as part of the unified plan, any plan, application form or any other similar document, that is required as a condition for the approval of Federal funding under the applicable program. These plans include such things as the WIA plan. They do not include jointly executed funding instruments, such as grant agreements, or Governor/Secretary Agreements or items such as corrective actions plans.

      (2) A state may submit a unified plan meeting the requirements of the Interagency guidance entitled  in lieu of completing the individual State planning guidelines of the programs covered by the unified plan.

      (c) A State which submits a unified plan covering an activity or program described in subsection 501(b) of WIA that is approved under subsection 501(d) of the Act will not be required to submit any other plan or application in order to receive Federal funds to carry out the activity or program.

      (d) Each portion of a unified plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section is subject to the particular requirements of Federal law authorizing the program. All grantees are still subject to such things as reporting and record-keeping requirements, corrective action plan requirements and other generally applicable requirements.

      (e) A unified plan must contain the information required by WIA section 501(c) and will be approved in accordance with the requirements of WIA section 501(d).

      § 661.330   Under what circumstances may the State use an alternative entity as the Local Workforce Investment Board?

#### § § 661.330

      (a) The State may use any local entity that meets the requirements of WIA section 117(i) to perform the functions of the Local Board. WIA section 117(i) requires that such entity:

      (1) Was established to serve the local area (or the service delivery area that most closely corresponds to the local area);

      (2) Was in existence on December 31, 1997;

      (3)(i) Is a Private Industry Council established under section 102 of the Job Training Partnership Act, as in effect on December 31, 1997; or

      (ii) Is substantially similar to the Local Board described in WIA section 117 (a), (b), and (c) and (h)(1) and (2); and,

      (4) Includes, at a minimum, two or more representatives of business in the local area and two or more representatives of labor organizations nominated by local labor federations or employees in the local area.

      (b)(1) If the Governor certifies an alternative entity to perform the functions of the Local Board; the State workforce investment plan must demonstrate that the alternative entity meets the requirements of WIA section 117(i), set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (2) If the alternative entity does not provide for representative membership of each of the categories of required Local Board membership under WIA section 117(b), including all of the One-stop partner programs, the local workforce investment plan must explain the manner in which the Local Board will ensure an ongoing role for the unrepresented membership group in the local workforce investment system.

      (3) The Local Board may provide an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the local plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups. The Local Board must enter into good faith negotiations over the terms of the MOU with all entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, including programs not represented on the alternative entity.

      (c) If the membership structure of an alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the Local Board. In such case, the chief elected official(s) must establish a new Local Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 117(a), (b), and (c) and (h)(1) and (2).

      (d) A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-voting members (including a Youth Council) are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.

      (e) In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the Local Board must be deemed to also apply to an alternative entity used by a local area. (WIA sec. 117(i).)

      § 662.220   What entity serves as the One-Stop partner for a particular program in the local area?

#### § § 662.220

      (a) The “entity” that carries out the program and activities listed in §§ 662.200 and 662.210 and, therefore, serves as the One-Stop partner is the grant recipient, administrative entity or organization responsible for administering the funds of the specified program in the local area. The term “entity” does not include the service providers that contract with or are subrecipients of the local administrative entity. For programs that do not include local administrative entities, the responsible State Agency should be the partner. Specific entities for particular programs are identified in paragraph (b) of this section. If a program or activity listed in § 662.200 is not carried out in a local area, the requirements relating to a required One-Stop partner are not applicable to such program or activity in that local One-Stop system.

      (b)(1) For title II of WIA, the entity that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) is the State eligible entity. The State eligible entity may designate an eligible provider, or a consortium of eligible providers, as the “entity” for this purpose;

      (2) For title I, Part A, of the Rehabilitation Act, the entity that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is the designated State agency or designated unit specified under section 101(a)(2) that is primarily concerned with vocational rehabilitation, or vocational and other rehabilitation, of individuals with disabilities; and

      (3) Under WIA, the national programs, including Job Corps, the WIA Indian and Native American program, the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program, and the Veterans' Workforce Investment program, are required One-Stop partners. Local Boards must include them in the One-Stop delivery system where they are present in their local area. In local areas where the national programs are not present, States and Local Boards should take steps to ensure that customer groups served by these programs have access to services through the One-Stop delivery system.

      § 662.230   What are the responsibilities of the required One-Stop partners?

#### § § 662.230

      All required partners must:

      (a) Make available to participants through the One-Stop delivery system the core services that are applicable to the partner's programs; (WIA sec. 121(b)(1)(A).)

      (b) Use a portion of funds made available to the partner's program, to the extent not inconsistent with the Federal law authorizing the partner's program, to:

      (1) Create and maintain the One-Stop delivery system; and

      (2) Provide core services; (WIA sec. 134(d)(1)(B).)

      (c) Enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Local Board relating to the operation of the One-Stop system that meets the requirements of § 662.300, including a description of services, how the cost of the identified services and operating costs of the system will be funded, and methods for referrals (WIA sec. 121(c));

      (d) Participate in the operation of the One-Stop system consistent with the terms of the MOU and requirements of authorizing laws; (WIA sec. 121(b)(1)(B).) and

      (e) Provide representation on the Local Workforce Investment Board. (WIA sec. 117(b)(2)(A)(vi).)

      § 662.240   What are a program's applicable core services?

#### § § 662.240

      (a) The core services applicable to any One-Stop partner program are those services described in paragraph (b) of this section, that are authorized and provided under the partner's program.

      (b) The core services identified in section 134(d)(2) of the WIA are:

      (1) Determinations of whether the individuals are eligible to receive assistance under subtitle B of title I of WIA;

      (2) Outreach, intake (which may include worker profiling), and orientation to the information and other services available through the One-Stop delivery system;

      (3) Initial assessment of skill levels, aptitudes, abilities, and supportive service needs;

      (4) Job search and placement assistance, and where appropriate, career counseling;

      (5) Provision of employment statistics information, including the provision of accurate information relating to local, regional, and national labor market areas, including—

      (i) Job vacancy listings in such labor market areas;

      (ii) Information on job skills necessary to obtain the listed jobs; and

      (iii) Information relating to local occupations in demand and the earnings and skill requirements for such occupations;

      (6) Provision of program performance information and program cost information on:

      (i) Eligible providers of training services described in WIA section 122;

      (ii) Eligible providers of youth activities described in WIA section 123;

      § 662.250   Where and to what extent must required One-Stop partners make core services available?

#### § § 662.250

      (a) At a minimum, the core services that are applicable to the program of the partner under § 662.220, and that are in addition to the basic labor exchange services traditionally provided in the local area under the Wagner-Peyser program, must be made available at the comprehensive One-Stop center. These services must be made available to individuals attributable to the partner's program who seek assistance at the center. The adult and dislocated worker program partners are required to make all of the core services listed in § 662.240 available at the center in accordance with 20 CFR 663.100(b)(1).

      (b) The applicable core services may be made available by the provision of appropriate technology at the comprehensive One-Stop center, by co-locating personnel at the center, cross-training of staff, or through a cost reimbursement or other agreement between service providers at the comprehensive One-Stop center and the partner, as described in the MOU.

      (c) The responsibility of the partner for the provision of core services must be proportionate to the use of the services at the comprehensive One-Stop center by the individuals attributable to the partner's program. The specific method of determining each partner's proportionate responsibility must be described in the MOU.

      (d) For purposes of this part, individuals attributable to the partner's program may include individuals who are referred through the comprehensive One-Stop center and enrolled in the partner's program after the receipt of core services, who have been enrolled in the partner's program prior to receipt of the applicable core services at the center, who meet the eligibility criteria for the partner's program and who receive an applicable core service, or who meet an alternative definition described in the MOU.

      (e) Under the MOU, the provision of applicable core services at the center by the One-Stop partner may be supplemented by the provision of such services through the networks of affiliated sites and networks of One-Stop partners described in WIA section 134(c)(2).

      § 662.260   What services, in addition to the applicable core services, are to be provided by One-Stop partners through the One-Stop delivery system?

#### § § 662.260

      In addition to the provision of core services, One-Stop partners must provide access to the other activities and programs carried out under the partner's authorizing laws. The access to these services must be described in the local MOU. 20 CFR part 663 describes the specific requirements relating to the provision of core, intensive, and training services through the One-Stop system that apply to the adult and the dislocated worker programs authorized under title I of WIA. Additional requirements apply to the provision of all labor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act. (WIA sec. 134(c)(1)(D).)

      § 662.270   How are the costs of providing services through the One-Stop delivery system and the operating costs of the system to be funded?

#### § § 662.270

      The MOU must describe the particular funding arrangements for services and operating costs of the One-Stop delivery system. Each partner must contribute a fair share of the operating costs of the One-Stop delivery system proportionate to the use of the system by individuals attributable to the partner's program. There are a number of methods, consistent with the equirements of the relevant OMB circulars, that may be used for allocating costs among the partners. Some of these methodologies include allocations based on direct charges, cost pooling, indirect cost rates and activity-based cost allocation plans. Additional guidance relating to cost allocation methods may be issued by the Department in consultation with the other appropriate Federal agencies.

      § 662.280   Does title I require One-Stop partners to use their funds for individuals who are not eligible for the partner's program or for services that are not authorized under the partner's program?

#### § § 662.280

      No, the requirements of the partner's program continue to apply. The Act intends to create a seamless service delivery system for individuals seeking workforce development services by linking the One-Stop partners in the One-Stop delivery system. While the overall effect is to provide universal access to core services, the resources of each partner may only be used to provide services that are authorized and provided under the partner's program to individuals who are eligible under such program. (WIA sec. 121(b)(1).)

    Subpart C—Memorandum of Understanding for the One-Stop Delivery System

      § 662.300   What is the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)?

#### § § 662.300

      (a) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is an agreement developed and executed between the Local Board, with the agreement of the chief elected official, and the One-Stop partners relating to the operation of the One-Stop delivery system in the local area.

      (b) The MOU must contain the provisions required by WIA section 121(c)(2). These provisions cover services to be provided through the One-Stop delivery system; the funding of the services and operating costs of the system; and methods for referring individuals between the One-Stop operators and partners. The MOU's provisions also must determine the duration and procedures for amending the MOU, and may contain any other provisions that are consistent with WIA title I and the WIA regulations agreed to by the parties. (WIA sec. 121(c).)

      § 662.310   Is there a single MOU for the local area or are there to be separate MOU's between the Local Board and each partner?

#### § § 662.310

      (a) A single “umbrella” MOU may be developed that addresses the issues relating to the local One-Stop delivery system for the Local Board, chief elected official and all partners, or the Local Board, chief elected official and the partners may decide to enter into separate agreements between the Local Board (with the agreement of the chief elected official) and one or more partners. Under either approach, the requirements described in this subpart apply. Since funds are generally appropriated annually, financial agreements may be negotiated with each partner annually to clarify funding of services and operating costs of the system under the MOU.

      (b) WIA emphasizes full and effective partnerships between Local Boards, chief elected officials and One-Stop partners. Local Boards and partners must enter into good-faith negotiations. Local Boards, chief elected officials and partners may request assistance from a State agency responsible for administering the partner program, the Governor, State Board, or other appropriate parties. The State agencies, the State Board, and the Governor may also consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations after exhausting other alternatives. The Local Board and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place. Any failure to execute an MOU between a Local Board and a required partner must be reported by the Local Board and the required partner to the Governor or State Board, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program, and by the Governor or the State Board and the responsible State agency to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program. (WIA sec. 121(c).)

      (c) If an impasse has not been resolved through the alternatives available under this section any partner that fails to execute an MOU may not be permitted to serve on the Local Board. In addition, any local area in which a Local Board has failed to execute an MOU with all of the required partners is not eligible for State incentive grants awarded on the basis of local coordination of activities under 20 CFR 665.200(d)(2). These sanctions are in addition to, not in lieu of, any other remedies that may be applicable to the Local Board or to each partner for failure to comply with the statutory requirement.

    Subpart D—One-Stop Operators

      § 662.400   Who is the One-Stop operator?

#### § § 662.400

      (a) The One-Stop operator is the entity that performs the role described in paragraph (c) of this section. The types of entities that may be selected to be the One-Stop operator include:

      (1) A postsecondary educational institution;

      (2) An Employment Service agency established under the Wagner-Peyser Act on behalf of the local office of the agency;

      (3) A private, nonprofit organization (including a community-based organization);

      (4) A private for-profit entity;

      (5) A government agency; and

      (6) Another interested organization or entity.

      (b) One-Stop operators may be a single entity or a consortium of entities and may operate one or more One-Stop centers. In addition, there may be more than one One-Stop operator in a local area.

      (c) The agreement between the Local Board and the One-Stop operator shall specify the operator's role. That role may range between simply coordinating service providers within the center, to being the primary provider of services within the center, to coordinating activities throughout the One-Stop system. (WIA sec. 121(d).)

      § 662.410   How is the One-Stop operator selected?

#### § § 662.410

      (a) The Local Board, with the agreement of the chief elected official, must designate and certify One-Stop operators in each local area.

      (b) The One-Stop operator is designated or certified:

      (1) Through a competitive process,

      (2) Under an agreement between the Local Board and a consortium of entities that includes at least three or more of the required One-Stop partners.identified at § 662.200, or

      (3) Under the conditions described in §§ 662.420 or 662.430. (WIA sec.121(d), 121(e) and 117(f)(2))

      (c) The designation or certification of the One-Stop operator must be carried out in accordance with the “sunshine provision” at 20 CFR 661.307.

      § 662.420   Under what limited conditions may the Local Board be designated or certified as the One-Stop operator?

#### § § 662.420

      (a) The Local Board may be designated or certified as the One-Stop operator only with the agreement of the chief elected official and the Governor.

      (b) The designation or certification must be reviewed whenever the biennial certification of the Local Board is made under 20 CFR 663.300(a). (WIA sec. 117(f)(2).)

      § 662.430   Under what conditions may One-Stop operators designated to operate in a One-Stop delivery system established prior to the enactment of WIA be designated to continue as a One-Stop operator under WIA without meeting the requirements of § 662.410(b)?

#### § § 662.430

      Under WIA section 121(e), the Local Board, the chief elected official and the Governor may agree to certify an entity that has been serving as a One-Stop operator in a One-Stop delivery system established prior to the enactment of WIA (August 7, 1998) to continue to serve as a One-Stop operator without meeting the requirements for designation under § 662.410(b) if the local One-Stop delivery system is modified, as necessary, to meet the other requirements of this part, including the requirements relating to the inclusion of One-Stop partners, the execution of the MOU, and the provision of services.(WIA sec. 121(e).)

### Part 663

**Authority:** Authority: Section 506(c), Pub. L. 105-220; 20 U.S.C. 9276(c).

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 49402, Aug. 11, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Delivery of Adult and Dislocated Worker Services Through the One-Stop Delivery System

      § 663.100   What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker programs in the One-Stop delivery system?

#### § § 663.100

      (a) The One-Stop system is the basic delivery system for adult and dislocated worker services. Through this system, adults and dislocated workers can access a continuum of services. The services are organized into three levels: core, intensive, and training.

      (b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local grant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated worker programs, is a required One-Stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR part 662. Consistent with those provisions:

      (1) Core services for adults and dislocated workers must be made available in at least one comprehensive One-Stop center in each local workforce investment area. Services may also be available elsewhere, either at affiliated sites or at specialized centers. For example, specialized centers may be established to serve workers being dislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve residents of public housing.

      (2) The One-Stop centers also make intensive services available to adults and dislocated workers, as needed, either by the One-Stop operator directly or through contracts with service providers that are approved by the Local Board.

      (3) Through the One-Stop system, adults and dislocated workers needing training are provided Individual Training Accounts (ITA's) and access to lists of eligible providers and programs of training. These lists contain quality consumer information, including cost and performance information for each of the providers' programs, so that participants can make informed choices on where to use their ITA's. (ITA's are more fully discussed in subpart D of this part.)

      § 663.105   When must adults and dislocated workers be registered?

#### § § 663.105

      (a) Registration is the process for collecting information to support a determination of eligibility. This information may be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's application.

      (b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under title I other than self-service or informational activities must be registered and determined eligible.

      (c) EO data must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for WIA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the recipient.

      § 663.110   What are the eligibility criteria for core services for adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?

#### § § 663.110

      To be eligible to receive core services as an adult in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must be 18 years of age or older. To be eligible for the dislocated worker programs, an eligible adult must meet the criteria of § 663.115. Eligibility criteria for intensive and training services are found at §§ 663.220 and 663.310.

      § 663.115   What are the eligibility criteria for core services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?

#### § § 663.115

      (a) To be eligible to receive core services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must meet the definition of “dislocated worker” at WIA section 101(9). Eligibility criteria for intensive and training services are found at §§ 663.220 and 663.310.

      (b) Governors and Local Boards may establish policies and procedures for One-Stop operators to use in determining an individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIA section 101(9). These policies and procedures may address such conditions as:

      (1) What constitutes a “general announcement” of plant closing under WIA section 101(9)(B)(ii) or (iii); and

      (2) What constitutes “unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters” for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, including family members and farm or ranch hands, under WIA section 101(9)(C).

      § 663.120   Are displaced homemakers eligible for dislocated worker activities under WIA?

#### § § 663.120

      (a) Yes, there are two significant differences from the eligibility requirements under the Job Training Partnership Act.

      (b) Under the dislocated worker program in JTPA, displaced homemakers are defined as “additional dislocated workers” and are only eligible to receive services if the Governor determines that providing such services would not adversely affect the delivery of services to the other eligible dislocated workers. Under WIA section 101(9), displaced homemakers who meet the definition at WIA section 101(10) are eligible dislocated workers without any additional determination.

      (c) The definition of displaced homemaker under JTPA included individuals who had been dependent upon public assistance under Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as well as those who had been dependent on the income of another family member. The definition in WIA section 101(10) includes only those individuals who were dependent on a family member's income. Those individuals who have been dependent on public assistance may be served in the adult program.

      § 663.145   What services are WIA title I adult and dislocated workers formula funds used to provide?

#### § § 663.145

      (a) WIA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults and dislocated workers must be used to provide core, intensive and training services through the One-Stop delivery system. Local Boards determine the most appropriate mix of these services, but all three types must be available for both adults and dislocated workers. There are different eligibility criteria for each of these types of services, which are described at §§ 663.110, 663.115, 663.220 and 663.310.

      (b) WIA title I funds may also be used to provide the other services described in WIA section 134(e):

      (1) Discretionary One-Stop delivery activities, including:

      (i) Customized screening and referral of qualified participants in training services to employment; and

      (ii) Customized employment-related services to employers on a fee-for-service basis that are in addition to labor exchange services available to employers under the Wagner-Peyser Act.

      (2) Supportive services, including needs-related payments, as described in subpart H of this part.

      § 663.150   What core services must be provided to adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 663.150

      (a) At a minimum, all of the core services described in WIA section 134(d)(2) and 20 CFR 662.240 must be provided in each local area through the One-Stop delivery system.

      (b) Followup services must be made available, as appropriate, for a minimum of 12 months following the first day of employment, to registered participants who are placed in unsubsidized employment.

      § 663.155   How are core services delivered?

#### § § 663.155

      Core services must be provided through the One-Stop delivery system. Core services may be provided directly by the One-Stop operator or through contracts with service providers that are approved by the Local Board. The Local Board may only be a provider of core services when approved by the chief elected official and the Governor in accordance with the requirements of WIA section 117(f)(2) and 20 CFR 661.310.

      § 663.160   Are there particular core services an individual must receive before receiving intensive services under WIA section 134(d)(3)?

#### § § 663.160

      (a) Yes, at a minimum, an individual must receive at least one core service, such as an initial assessment or job search and placement assistance, before receiving intensive services. The initial assessment provides preliminary information about the individual's skill levels, aptitudes, interests, and supportive services needs. The job search and placement assistance helps the individual determine whether he or she is unable to obtain employment, and thus requires more intensive services to obtain employment. The decision on which core services to provide, and the timing of their delivery, may be made on a case-by-case basis at the local level depending upon the needs of the participant.

      (b) A determination of the need for intensive services under § 663.220, as established by the initial assessment or the individual's inability to obtain employment through the core services provided, must be contained in the participant's case file.

      § 663.165   How long must an individual be in core services in order to be eligible for intensive services?

#### § § 663.165

      There is no Federally-required minimum time period for participation in core services before receiving intensive services. (WIA sec. 134(d)(3).)

    Subpart B—Intensive Services

      § 663.200   What are intensive services for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 663.200

      (a) Intensive services are listed in WIA section 134(d)(3)(C). The list in the Act is not all-inclusive and other intensive services, such as out-of-area job search assistance, literacy activities related to basic workforce readiness, relocation assistance, internships, and work experience may be provided, based on an assessment or individual employment plan.

      (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, work experience is a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience workplace may be in the private for profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, exists.

      § 663.210   How are intensive services delivered?

#### § § 663.210

      (a) Intensive services must be provided through the One-Stop delivery system, including specialized One-Stop centers. Intensive services may be provided directly by the One-Stop operator or through contracts with service providers, which may include contracts with public, private for-profit, and private non-profit service providers (including specialized service providers), that are approved by the Local Board. (WIA secs. 117(d)(2)(D) and 134(d)(3)(B).)

      (b) The Local Board may only be a provider of intensive services when approved by the chief elected official and the Governor in accordance with WIA section 117(f)(2) and 20 CFR 661.310.

      § 663.220   Who may receive intensive services?

#### § § 663.220

      There are two categories of adults and dislocated workers who may receive intensive services:

      (a) Adults and dislocated workers who are unemployed, have received at least one core service and are unable to obtain employment through core services, and are determined by a One-Stop operator to be in need of more intensive services to obtain employment; and

      (b) Adults and dislocated workers who are employed, have received at least one core service, and are determined by a One-Stop operator to be in need of intensive services to obtain or retain employment that leads to self-sufficiency, as described in § 663.230.

      § 663.230   What criteria must be used to determine whether an employed worker needs intensive services to obtain or retain employment leading to “self-sufficiency”?

#### § § 663.230

      State Boards or Local Boards must set the criteria for determining whether employment leads to self-sufficiency. At a minimum, such criteria must provide that self-sufficiency means employment that pays at least the lower living standard income level, as defined in WIA section 101(24). Self-sufficiency for a dislocated worker may be defined in relation to a percentage of the layoff wage. The special needs of individuals with disabilities or other barriers to employment should be taken into account when setting criteria to determine self-sufficiency.

      § 663.240   Are there particular intensive services an individual must receive before receiving training services under WIA section 134(d)(4)(A)(i)?

#### § § 663.240

      (a) Yes, at a minimum, an individual must receive at least one intensive service, such as development of an individual employment plan with a case manager or individual counseling and career planning, before the individual may receive training services.

      (b) The case file must contain a determination of need for training services under § 663.310, as identified in the individual employment plan, comprehensive assessment, or through any other intensive service received.

      § 663.245   What is the individual employment plan?

#### § § 663.245

      The individual employment plan is an ongoing strategy jointly developed by the participant and the case manager that identifies the participant's employment goals, the appropriate achievement objectives, and the appropriate combination of services for the participant to achieve the employment goals.

      § 663.250   How long must an individual participant be in intensive services to be eligible for training services?

#### § § 663.250

      There is no Federally-required minimum time period for participation in intensive services before receiving training services. The period of time an individual spends in intensive services should be sufficient to prepare the individual for training or employment. (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(A)(i).)

    Subpart C—Training Services

      § 663.300   What are training services for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 663.300

      Training services are listed in WIA section 134(d)(4)(D). The list in the Act is not all-inclusive and additional training services may be provided.

      § 663.310   Who may receive training services?

#### § § 663.310

      Training services may be made available to employed and unemployed adults and dislocated workers who:

      (a) Have met the eligibility requirements for intensive services, have received at least one intensive service under § 663.240, and have been determined to be unable to obtain or retain employment through such services;

      (b) After an interview, evaluation, or assessment, and case management, have been determined by a One-Stop operator or One-Stop partner, to be in need of training services and to have the skills and qualifications to successfully complete the selected training program;

      (c) Select a program of training services that is directly linked to the employment opportunities either in the local area or in another area to which the individual is willing to relocate;

      (d) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of such training, including such sources as Welfare-to-Work, State-funded training funds, Trade Adjustment Assistance and Federal Pell Grants established under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or require WIA assistance in addition to other sources of grant assistance, including Federal Pell Grants (provisions relating to fund coordination are found at § 663.320 and WIA section 134(d)(4)(B)); and

      (e) For individuals whose services are provided through the adult funding stream, are determined eligible in accordance with the State and local priority system, if any, in effect for adults under WIA section 134(d)(4)(E) and § 663.600. (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(A).)

      § 663.320   What are the requirements for coordination of WIA training funds and other grant assistance?

#### § § 663.320

      (a) WIA funding for training is limited to participants who:

      (1) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of their training; or

      (2) Require assistance beyond that available under grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of such training. Program operators and training providers must coordinate funds available to pay for training as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (b) Program operators must coordinate training funds available and make funding arrangements with One-Stop partners and other entities to apply the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. Training providers must consider the availability of other sources of grants to pay for training costs such as Welfare-to-Work, State-funded training funds, and Federal Pell Grants, so that WIA funds supplement other sources of training grants.

      (c) A WIA participant may enroll in WIA-funded training while his/her application for a Pell Grant is pending as long as the One-Stop operator has made arrangements with the training provider and the WIA participant regarding allocation of the Pell Grant, if it is subsequently awarded. In that case, the training provider must reimburse the One-Stop operator the WIA funds used to underwrite the training for the amount the Pell Grant covers. Reimbursement is not required from the portion of Pell Grant assistance disbursed to the WIA participant for education-related expenses. (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(B).)

    Subpart D—Individual Training Accounts

      § 663.400   How are training services provided?

#### § § 663.400

      Except under the three conditions described in WIA section 134(d)(4)(G)(ii) and § 663.430(a), the Individual Training Account (ITA) is established for eligible individuals to finance training services. Local Boards may only provide training services under § 663.430 if they receive a waiver from the Governor and meet the requirements of 20 CFR 661.310 and WIA section 117(f)(1). (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(G).)

      § 663.410   What is an Individual Training Account (ITA)?

#### § § 663.410

      The ITA is established on behalf of a participant. WIA title I adult and dislocated workers purchase training services from eligible providers they select in consultation with the case manager. Payments from ITA's may be made in a variety of ways, including the electronic transfer of funds through financial institutions, vouchers, or other appropriate methods. Payments may also be made incrementally; through payment of a portion of the costs at different points in the training course. (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(G).)

      § 663.420   Can the duration and amount of ITA's be limited?

#### § § 663.420

      (a) Yes, the State or Local Board may impose limits on ITA's, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.

      (b) Limits to ITA's may be established in different ways:

      (1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the individual employment plan; or

      (2) There may be a policy decision by the State Board or Local Board to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount applicable to all ITA's.

      (c) Limitations established by State or Local Board policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but should not be implemented in a manner that undermines the Act's requirement that training services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an eligible training provider. ITA limitations may provide for exceptions to the limitations in individual cases.

      (d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.

      § 663.430   Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than ITA's be used to provide training services?

#### § § 663.430

      (a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITA's only when one of the following three exceptions applies:

      (1) When the services provided are on-the-job training (OJT) or customized training;

      (2) When the Local Board determines that there are an insufficient number of eligible providers in the local area to accomplish the purpose of a system of ITA's. The Local Plan must describe the process to be used in selecting the providers under a contract for services. This process must include a public comment period for interested providers of at least 30 days;

      (3) When the Local Board determines that there is a training services program of demonstrated effectiveness offered in the area by a community-based organization (CBO) or another private organization to serve special participant populations that face multiple barriers to employment, as described in paragraph (b) in this section. The Local Board must develop criteria to be used in determining demonstrated effectiveness, particularly as it applies to the special participant population to be served. The criteria may include:

      (i) Financial stability of the organization;

      (ii) Demonstrated performance in the delivery of services to hard to serve participant populations through such means as program completion rate; attainment of the skills, certificates or degrees the program is designed to provide; placement after training in unsubsidized employment; and retention in employment; and

      (iii) How the specific program relates to the workforce investment needs identified in the local plan.

      (b) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, special participant populations that face multiple barriers to employment are populations of low-income individuals that are included in one or more of the following categories:

      (1) Individuals with substantial language or cultural barriers;

      (2) Offenders;

      (3) Homeless individuals; and

      (4) Other hard-to-serve populations as defined by the Governor.

      § 663.440   What are the requirements for consumer choice?

#### § § 663.440

      (a) Training services, whether under ITA's or under contract, must be provided in a manner that maximizes informed consumer choice in selecting an eligible provider.

      (b) Each Local Board, through the One-Stop center, must make available to customers the State list of eligible providers required in WIA section 122(e). The list includes a description of the programs through which the providers may offer the training services, the information identifying eligible providers of on-the-job training and customized training required under WIA section 122(h) (where applicable), and the performance and cost information about eligible providers of training services described in WIA sections 122 (e) and (h).

      (c) An individual who has been determined eligible for training services under § 663.310 may select a provider described in paragraph (b) of this section after consultation with a case manager. Unless the program has exhausted training funds for the program year, the operator must refer the individual to the selected provider, and establish an ITA for the individual to pay for training. For purposes of this paragraph, a referral may be carried out by providing a voucher or certificate to the individual to obtain the training.

      (d) The cost of referral of an individual with an ITA to a training provider is paid by the applicable adult or dislocated worker program under title I of WIA.

    Subpart E—Eligible Training Providers

      § 663.500   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 663.500

      The workforce investment system established under WIA emphasizes informed customer choice, system performance, and continuous improvement. The eligible provider process is part of the strategy for achieving these goals. Local Boards, in partnership with the State, identify training providers and programs whose performance qualifies them to receive WIA funds to train adults and dislocated workers. In order to maximize customer choice and assure that all significant population groups are served, States and local areas should administer the eligible provider process in a manner to assure that significant numbers of competent providers, offering a wide variety of training programs and occupational choices, are available to customers. After receiving core and intensive services and in consultation with case managers, eligible participants who need training use the list of these eligible providers to make an informed choice. The ability of providers to successfully perform, the procedures State and Local Boards use to establish eligibility, and the degree to which information, including performance information, on those providers is made available to customers eligible for training services, are key factors affecting the successful implementation of the Statewide workforce investment system. This subpart describes the process for determining eligible training providers.

      § 663.505   What are eligible providers of training services?

#### § § 663.505

      (a) Eligible providers of training services are described in WIA section 122. They are those entities eligible to receive WIA title I-B funds to provide training services to eligible adult and dislocated worker customers.

      (b) In order to provide training services under WIA title I-B, a provider must meet the requirements of this subpart and WIA section 122.

      (1) These requirements apply to the use of WIA title I adult and dislocated worker funds to provide training:

      (i) To individuals using ITA's to access training through the eligible provider list; and

      (ii) To individuals for training provided through the exceptions to ITA's described at § 663.430 (a)(2) and (a)(3).

      (2) These requirements apply to all organizations providing training to adult and dislocated workers, including:

      (i) Postsecondary educational institutions providing a program described in WIA section 122(a)(2)(A)(ii);

      (ii) Entities that carry out programs under the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50 );

      (iii) Other public or private providers of a program of training services described in WIA section 122(a)(2)(C);

      (iv) Local Boards, if they meet the conditions of WIA section 117(f)(1); and

      (v) Community-based organizations and other private organizations providing training under § 663.430.

      (c) Provider eligibility procedures must be established by the Governor, as required by this subpart. Different procedures are described in WIA for determinations of “initial” and “subsequent” eligibility. Because the processes are different, they are discussed separately.

      § 663.508   What is a “program of training services”?

#### § § 663.508

      A program of training services is one or more courses or classes, or a structured regimen, that upon successful completion, leads to:

      (a) A certificate, an associate degree, baccalaureate degree, or

      (b) The skills or competencies needed for a specific job or jobs, an occupation, occupational group, or generally, for many types of jobs or occupations, as recognized by employers and determined prior to training.

      § 663.510   Who is responsible for managing the eligible provider process?

#### § § 663.510

      (a) The State and the Local Boards each have responsibilities for managing the eligible provider process.

      (b) The Governor must establish eligibility criteria for certain providers to become initially eligible and must set minimum levels of performance for all providers to remain subsequently eligible.

      (c) The Governor must designate a State agency (called the “designated State agency”) to assist in carrying out WIA section 122. The designated State agency is responsible for:

      (1) Developing and maintaining the State list of eligible providers and programs, which is comprised of lists submitted by Local Boards;

      (2) Determining if programs meet performance levels, including verifying the accuracy of the information on the State list in consultation with the Local Boards, removing programs that do not meet program performance levels, and taking appropriate enforcement actions, against providers in the case of the intentional provision of inaccurate information, as described in WIA section 122(f)(1), and in the case of a substantial violation of the requirements of WIA, as described in WIA section 122(f)(2);

      (3) Disseminating the State list, accompanied by performance and cost information relating to each provider, to One-Stop operators throughout the State.

      (d) The Local Board must:

      (1) Accept applications for initial eligibility from certain postsecondary institutions and entities providing apprenticeship training;

      (2) Carry out procedures prescribed by the Governor to assist in determining the initial eligibility of other providers;

      (3) Carry out procedures prescribed by the Governor to assist in determining the subsequent eligibility of all providers;

      (4) Compile a local list of eligible providers, collect the performance and cost information and any other required information relating to providers;

      (5) Submit the local list and information to the designated State agency;

      (6) Ensure the dissemination and appropriate use of the State list through the local One-Stop system;

      (7) Consult with the designated State agency in cases where termination of an eligible provider is contemplated because inaccurate information has been provided; and

      (8) Work with the designated State agency in cases where the termination of an eligible provider is contemplated because of violations of the Act.

      (e) The Local Board may:

      (1) Make recommendations to the Governor on the procedures to be used in determining initial eligibility of certain providers;

      (2) Increase the levels of performance required by the State for local providers to maintain subsequent eligibility;

      (3) Require additional verifiable program-specific information from local providers to maintain subsequent eligibility.

      § 663.515   What is the process for initial determination of provider eligibility?

#### § § 663.515

      (a) To be eligible to receive adult or dislocated worker training funds under title I of WIA, all providers must submit applications to the Local Boards in the areas in which they wish to provide services. The application must describe each program of training services to be offered.

      (b) For programs eligible under title IV of the Higher Education Act and apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA), and the providers or such programs, Local Boards determine the procedures to use in making an application. The procedures established by the Local Board must specify the timing, manner, and contents of the required application.

      (c) For programs not eligible under title IV of the HEA or registered under the NAA, and for providers not eligible under title IV of the HEA or carrying out apprenticeship programs under NAA:

      (1) The Governor must develop a procedure for use by Local Boards for determining the eligibility of other providers, after

      (i) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local Boards and providers of training services within the State;

      (ii) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor organizations, to submit comments on the procedure; and

      (iii) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and provider, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.

      (2) The procedure must be described in the State Plan.

      (3)(i) The procedure must require that the provider must submit an application to the Local Board at such time and in such manner as may be required, which contains a description of the program of training services;

      (ii) If the provider provides a program of training services on the date of application, the procedure must require that the application include an appropriate portion of the performance information and program cost information described in § 663.540, and that the program meet appropriate levels of performance;

      (iii) If the provider does not provide a program of training services on that date, the procedure must require that the provider meet appropriate requirements specified in the procedure. (WIA sec. 122(b)(2)(D).)

      (d) The Local Board must include providers that meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on a local list and submit the list to the designated State agency. The State agency has 30 days to determine that the provider or its programs do not meet the requirements relating to the providers under paragraph (c) of this section. After the agency determines that the provider and its programs meet(s) the criteria for initial eligibility, or 30 days have elapsed, whichever occurs first, the provider and its programs are initially eligible. The programs and providers submitted under paragraph (b) of this section are initially eligible without State agency review. (WIA sec. 122(e).)

      § 663.530   Is there a time limit on the period of initial eligibility for training providers?

#### § § 663.530

      Yes, under WIA section 122(c)(5), the Governor must require training providers to submit performance information and meet performance levels annually in order to remain eligible providers. States may require that these performance requirements be met one year from the date that initial eligibility was determined, or may require all eligible providers to submit performance information by the same date each year. If the latter approach is adopted, the Governor may exempt eligible providers whose determination of initial eligibility occurs within six months of the date of submissions. The effect of this requirement is that no training provider may have a period of initial eligibility that exceeds eighteen months. In the limited circumstance when insufficient data is available, initial eligibility may be extended for a period of up to six additional months, if the Governor's procedures provide for such an extension.

      § 663.535   What is the process for determining the subsequent eligibility of a provider?

#### § § 663.535

      (a) The Governor must develop a procedure for the Local Board to use in determining the subsequent eligibility of all eligible training providers determined initially eligible under § 663.515 (b) and (c), after:

      (1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local Boards and providers of training services within the State;

      (2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor organizations, to submit comments on such procedure; and

      (3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and providers, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.

      (b) The procedure must be described in the State Plan.

      (c) The procedure must require that:

      (1) Providers annually submit performance and cost information as described at WIA section 122(d)(1) and (2), for each program of training services for which the provider has been determined to be eligible, in a time and manner determined by the Local Board;

      (2) Providers and programs annually meet minimum performance levels described at WIA section 122(c)(6), as demonstrated utilizing UI quarterly wage records where appropriate.

      (d) The program's performance information must meet the minimum acceptable levels established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to remain eligible;

      (e) Local Boards may require higher levels of performance for local programs than the levels specified in the procedures established by the Governor. (WIA sec.122(c)(5) and (c)(6).)

      (f) The State procedure must require Local Boards to take into consideration:

      (1) The specific economic, geographic and demographic factors in the local areas in which providers seeking eligibility are located, and

      (2) The characteristics of the populations served by programs seeking eligibility, including the demonstrated difficulties in serving these populations, where applicable.

      (g) The Local Board retains those programs on the local list that meet the required performance levels and other elements of the State procedures and submits the list, accompanied by the performance and cost information, and any additional required information, to the designated State agency. If the designated State agency determines within 30 days from the receipt of the information that the program does not meet the performance levels established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the program may be removed from the list. A program retained on the local list and not removed by the designated State agency is considered an eligible program of training services.

      § 663.540   What kind of performance and cost information is required for determinations of subsequent eligibility?

#### § § 663.540

      (a) Eligible providers of training services must submit, at least annually, under procedures established by the Governor under § 663.535(c):

      (1) Verifiable program-specific performance information, including:

      (i) The information described in WIA section 122(d)(1)(A)(i) for all individuals participating in the programs of training services, including individuals who are not receiving assistance under WIA section 134 and individuals who are receiving such assistance; and

      (ii) The information described in WIA section 122(d)(1)(A)(ii) relating only to individuals receiving assistance under the WIA adult and dislocated worker program who are participating in the applicable program of training services; and

      (2) Information on program costs (such as tuition and fees) for WIA participants in the program.

      (b) Governors may require any additional verifiable performance information (such as the information described at WIA section 122(d)(2)) that the Governor determines to be appropriate to obtain subsequent eligibility, including information regarding all participating individuals as well as individuals receiving assistance under the WIA adult and dislocated worker program.

      (c) Governors must establish procedures by which providers can demonstrate if the additional information required under paragraph (b) of this section imposes extraordinary costs on providers, or if providers experience extraordinary costs in the collection of information. If, through these procedures, providers demonstrate that they experience such extraordinary costs:

      (1) The Governor or Local Board must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of the information; or

      (2) The Governor must provide additional resources to assist providers in the collection of the information from funds for Statewide workforce investment activities reserved under WIA sections 128(a) and 133(a)(1).

      (d) The Local Board and the designated State agency may accept program-specific performance information consistent with the requirements for eligibility under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 from a provider for purposes of enabling the provider to fulfill the applicable requirements of this section, if the information is substantially similar to the information otherwise required under this section.

      § 663.550   How is eligible provider information developed and maintained?

#### § § 663.550

      (a) The designated State agency must maintain a list of all eligible training programs and providers in the State (the “State list”).

      (b) The State list is a compilation of the eligible programs and providers identified or retained by local areas and that have not been removed under §§ 663.535(g) and 663.565.

      (c) The State list must be accompanied by the performance and cost information contained in the local lists as required by § 663.535(e). (WIA sec. 122(e)(4)(A).)

      § 663.555   How is the State list disseminated?

#### § § 663.555

      (a) The designated State agency must disseminate the State list and accompanying performance and cost information to the One-Stop delivery systems within the State.

      (b) The State list and information must be updated at least annually.

      (c) The State list and accompanying information form the primary basis of the One-Stop consumer reports system that provides for informed customer choice. The list and information must be widely available, through the One-Stop delivery system, to customers seeking information on training outcomes, as well as participants in employment and training activities funded under WIA and other programs.

      (1) The State list must be made available to individuals who have been determined eligible for training services under § 663.310.

      (2) The State list must also be made available to customers whose training is supported by other One-Stop partners.

      § 663.565   May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?

#### § § 663.565

      (a) Yes. A training provider must deliver results and provide accurate information in order to retain its status as an eligible training provider.

      (b) If the provider's programs do not meet the established performance levels, the programs will be removed from the eligible provider list.

      (1) A Local Board must determine, during the subsequent eligibility determination process, whether a provider's programs meet performance levels. If the program fails to meet such levels, the program must be removed from the local list. If all of the provider's programs fail to meet such levels, the provider must be removed from the local list.

      (2) The designated State agency upon receipt of the performance information accompanying the local list, may remove programs from the State list if the agency determines the program failed to meet the levels of performance prescribed under § 663.535(c). If all of the provider's programs are determined to have failed to meet the levels, the designated State agency may remove the provider from the State list.

      (3) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have subsequently violated any provision of title I of WIA or the WIA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37, may be removed from the list in accordance with the enforcement provisions of WIA section 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under these conditions is liable to repay all adult and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance.

      (4) The Governor must establish appeal procedures for providers of training to appeal a denial of eligibility under this subpart according to the requirements of 20 CFR 667.640(b).

      § 663.570   What is the consumer reports system?

#### § § 663.570

      The consumer reports system, referred to in WIA as performance information, is the vehicle for informing the customers of the One-Stop delivery system about the performance of training providers and programs in the local area. It is built upon the State list of eligible providers and programs developed through the procedures described in WIA section 122 and this subpart. The consumer reports system must contain the information necessary for an adult or dislocated worker customer to fully understand the options available to him or her in choosing a program of training services. Such program-specific factors may include overall performance, performance for significant customer groups (including wage replacement rates for dislocated workers), performance of specific provider sites, current information on employment and wage trends and projections, and duration of training programs.

      § 663.575   In what ways can a Local Board supplement the information available from the State list?

#### § § 663.575

      (a) Local Boards may supplement the information available from the State list by providing customers with additional information to assist in supporting informed customer choice and the achievement of local performance measures (as described in WIA section 136).

      (b) This additional information may include:

      (1) Information on programs of training services that are linked to occupations in demand in the local area;

      (2) Performance and cost information, including program-specific performance and cost information, for the local outlet(s) of multi-site eligible providers; and

      (3) Other appropriate information related to the objectives of WIA, which may include the information described in § 663.570.

      § 663.585   May individuals choose training providers located outside of the local area?

#### § § 663.585

      Yes, individuals may choose any of the eligible providers and programs on the State list. A State may also establish a reciprocal agreement with another State(s) to permit providers of eligible training programs in each State to accept individual training accounts provided by the other State. (WIA secs. 122(e)(4) and (e)(5).)

      § 663.590   May a community-based organization (CBO) be included on an eligible provider list?

#### § § 663.590

      Yes, CBO's may apply and they and their programs may be determined eligible providers of training services, under WIA section 122 and this subpart. As eligible providers, CBO's provide training through ITA's and may also receive contracts for training special participant populations when the requirements of § 663.430 are met.

      § 663.595   What requirements apply to providers of OJT and customized training?

#### § § 663.595

      For OJT and customized training providers, One-Stop operators in a local area must collect such performance information as the Governor may require, determine whether the providers meet such performance criteria as the Governor may require, and disseminate a list of providers that have met such criteria, along with the relevant performance information about them, through the One-Stop delivery system. Providers determined to meet the criteria are considered to be identified as eligible providers of training services. These providers are not subject to the other requirements of WIA section 122 or this subpart.

    Subpart F—Priority and Special Populations

      § 663.600   What priority must be given to low-income adults and public assistance recipients served with adult funds under title I?

#### § § 663.600

      (a) WIA states, in section 134(d)(4)(E), that in the event that funds allocated to a local area for adult employment and training activities are limited, priority for intensive and training services funded with title I adult funds must be given to recipients of public assistance and other low-income individuals in the local area.

      (b) Since funding is generally limited, States and local areas must establish criteria by which local areas can determine the availability of funds and the process by which any priority will be applied under WIA section 134(d)(2)(E). Such criteria may include the availability of other funds for providing employment and training-related services in the local area, the needs of the specific groups within the local area, and other appropriate factors.

      (c) States and local areas must give priority for adult intensive and training services to recipients of public assistance and other low-income individuals, unless the local area has determined that funds are not limited under the criteria established under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) The process for determining whether to apply the priority established under paragraph (b) of this section does not necessarily mean that only the recipients of public assistance and other low income individuals may receive WIA adult funded intensive and training services when funds are determined to be limited in a local area. The Local Board and the Governor may establish a process that gives priority for services to the recipients of public assistance and other low income individuals and that also serves other individuals meeting eligibility requirements.

      § 663.610   Does the statutory priority for use of adult funds also apply to dislocated worker funds?

#### § § 663.610

      No, the statutory priority applies to adult funds for intensive and training services only. Funds allocated for dislocated workers are not subject to this requirement.

      § 663.620   How do the Welfare-to-Work program and the TANF program relate to the One-Stop delivery system?

#### § § 663.620

      (a) The local Welfare-to-Work (WtW) program operator is a required partner in the One-Stop delivery system. 20 CFR part 662 describes the roles of such partners in the One-Stop delivery system and applies to the Welfare-to-Work program operator. WtW programs serve individuals who may also be served by the WIA programs and, through appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have access to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the WtW program in the One-Stop system. WtW participants, who are determined to be WIA eligible, and who need occupational skills training may be referred through the One-Stop system to receive WIA training, when WtW grant and other grant funds are not available in accordance with § 663.320(a). WIA participants who are also determined WtW eligible, may be referred to the WtW operator for job placement and other WtW assistance.

      (b) The local TANF agency is specifically suggested under WIA as an additional partner in the One-Stop system. TANF recipients will have access to more information about employment opportunities and services when the TANF agency participates in the One-Stop delivery system. The Governor and Local Board should encourage the TANF agency to become a One-Stop partner to improve the quality of services to the WtW and TANF-eligible populations. In addition, becoming a One-Stop partner will ensure that the TANF agency is represented on the Local Board and participates in developing workforce investment strategies that help cash assistance recipients secure lasting employment.

      § 663.630   How does a displaced homemaker qualify for services under title I?

#### § § 663.630

      Displaced homemakers may be eligible to receive assistance under title I in a variety of ways, including:

      (a) Core services provided by the One-Stop partners through the One-Stop delivery system;

      (b) Intensive or training services for which an individual qualifies as a dislocated worker/displaced homemaker if the requirements of this part are met;

      (c) Intensive or training services for which an individual is eligible if the requirements of this part are met;

      (d) Statewide employment and training projects conducted with reserve funds for innovative programs for displaced homemakers, as described in 20 CFR 665.210(f).

      § 663.640   May an individual with a disability whose family does not meet income eligibility criteria under the Act be eligible for priority as a low-income adult?

#### § § 663.640

      Yes, even if the family of an individual with a disability does not meet the income eligibility criteria, the individual with a disability is to be considered a low-income individual if the individual's own income:

      (a) Meets the income criteria established in WIA section 101(25)(B); or

      (b) Meets the income eligibility criteria for cash payments under any Federal, State or local public assistance program. (WIA sec. 101(25)(F).)

#### § § 663.700

      (a) On-the-job training (OJT) is defined at WIA section 101(31). OJT is provided under a contract with an employer in the public, private non-profit, or private sector. Through the OJT contract, occupational training is provided for the WIA participant in exchange for the reimbursement of up to 50 percent of the wage rate to compensate for the employer's extraordinary costs. (WIA sec. 101(31)(B).)

      (b) The local program must not contract with an employer who has previously exhibited a pattern of failing to provide OJT participants with continued long-term employment with wages, benefits, and working conditions that are equal to those provided to regular employees who have worked a similar length of time and are doing the same type of work. (WIA sec. 195(4).)

      (c) An OJT contract must be limited to the period of time required for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, consideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's individual employment plan. (WIA sec. 101(31)(C).)

      § 663.705   What are the requirements for OJT contracts for employed workers?

#### § § 663.705

      OJT contracts may be written for eligible employed workers when:

      (a) The employee is not earning a self-sufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy;

      (b) The requirements in § 663.700 are met; and

      (c) The OJT relates to the introduction of new technologies, introduction to new production or service procedures, upgrading to new jobs that require additional skills, workplace literacy, or other appropriate purposes identified by the Local Board.

      § 663.710   What conditions govern OJT payments to employers?

#### § § 663.710

      (b) Employers may be reimbursed up to 50 percent of the wage rate of an OJT participant for the extraordinary costs of providing the training and additional supervision related to the OJT. (WIA sec. 101(31)(B).)

      (c) Employers are not required to document such extraordinary costs.

      § 663.715   What is customized training?

#### § § 663.715

      Customized training is training:

      (a) That is designed to meet the special requirements of an employer (including a group of employers);

      (b) That is conducted with a commitment by the employer to employ, or in the case of incumbent workers, continue to employ, an individual on successful completion of the training; and

      (c) For which the employer pays for not less than 50 percent of the cost of the training. (WIA sec. 101(8).)

      § 663.720   What are the requirements for customized training for employed workers?

#### § § 663.720

      Customized training of an eligible employed individual may be provided for an employer or a group of employers when:

      (a) The employee is not earning a self-sufficient wage as determined by Local Board policy;

      (b) The requirements in § 663.715 are met; and

      (c) The customized training relates to the purposes described in § 663.705(c) or other appropriate purposes identified by the Local Board.

      § 663.730   May funds provided to employers for OJT of customized training be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing?

#### § § 663.730

      No, funds provided to employers for OJT or customized training must not be used to directly or indirectly assist, promote or deter union organizing.

    Subpart H—Supportive Services

      § 663.800   What are supportive services for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 663.800

      Supportive services for adults and dislocated workers are defined at WIA sections 101(46) and 134(e)(2) and (3). They include services such as transportation, child care, dependent care, housing, and needs-related payments, that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in activities authorized under WIA title I. Local Boards, in consultation with the One-Stop partners and other community service providers, must develop a policy on supportive services that ensures resource and service coordination in the local area. Such policy should address procedures for referral to such services, including how such services will be funded when they are not otherwise available from other sources. The provision of accurate information about the availability of supportive services in the local area, as well as referral to such activities, is one of the core services that must be available to adults and dislocated workers through the One-Stop delivery system. (WIA sec. 134(d)(2)(H).)

      § 663.805   When may supportive services be provided to participants?

#### § § 663.805

      (a) Supportive services may only be provided to individuals who are:

      (1) Participating in core, intensive or training services; and

      (2) Unable to obtain supportive services through other programs providing such services. (WIA sec. 134(e)(2)(A) and (B).)

      (b) Supportive services may only be provided when they are necessary to enable individuals to participate in title I activities. (WIA sec. 101(46).)

      § 663.810   Are there limits on the amounts or duration of funds for supportive services?

#### § § 663.810

      (a) Local Boards may establish limits on the provision of supportive services or provide the One-Stop operator with the authority to establish such limits, including a maximum amount of funding and maximum length of time for supportive services to be available to participants.

      (b) Procedures may also be established to allow One-Stop operators to grant exceptions to the limits established under paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 663.815   What are needs-related payments?

#### § § 663.815

      Needs-related payments provide financial assistance to participants for the purpose of enabling individuals to participate in training and are one of the supportive services authorized by WIA section 134(e)(3).

      § 663.820   What are the eligibility requirements for adults to receive needs-related payments?

#### § § 663.820

      Adults must:

      (a) Be unemployed,

      (b) Not qualify for, or have ceased qualifying for, unemployment compensation; and

      (c) Be enrolled in a program of training services under WIA section 134(d)(4).

      § 663.825   What are the eligibility requirements for dislocated workers to receive needs-related payments?

#### § § 663.825

      To receive needs related payments, a dislocated worker must:

      (a) Be unemployed, and:

      (1) Have ceased to qualify for unemployment compensation or trade readjustment allowance under TAA or NAFTA-TAA; and

      (2) Be enrolled in a program of training services under WIA section 134(d)(4) by the end of the 13th week after the most recent layoff that resulted in a determination of the worker's eligibility as a dislocated worker, or, if later, by the end of the 8th week after the worker is informed that a short-term layoff will exceed 6 months; or

      (b) Be unemployed and did not qualify for unemployment compensation or trade readjustment assistance under TAA or NAFTA-TAA.

      § 663.830   May needs-related payments be paid while a participant is waiting to start training classes?

#### § § 663.830

      Yes, payments may be provided if the participant has been accepted in a training program that will begin within 30 calendar days. The Governor may authorize local areas to extend the 30 day period to address appropriate circumstances.

      § 663.840   How is the level of needs-related payments determined?

#### § § 663.840

      (a) The payment level for adults must be established by the Local Board.

      (b) For dislocated workers, payments must not exceed the greater of either of the following levels:

      (1) For participants who were eligible for unemployment compensation as a result of the qualifying dislocation, the payment may not exceed the applicable weekly level of the unemployment compensation benefit; or

      (2) For participants who did not qualify for unemployment compensation as a result of the qualifying layoff, the weekly payment may not exceed the poverty level for an equivalent period. The weekly payment level must be adjusted to reflect changes in total family income as determined by Local Board policies. (WIA sec. 134(e)(3)(C).)

      § 664.205   How is the “deficient in basic literacy skills” criterion in § 664.200(c)(1) defined and documented?

#### § § 664.205

      (a) Definitions and eligibility documentation requirements regarding the “deficient in basic literacy skills” criterion in § 664.200(c)(1) may be established at the State or local level. These definitions may establish such criteria as are needed to address State or local concerns, and must include a determination that an individual:

      (1) Computes or solves problems, reads, writes, or speaks English at or below the 8th grade level on a generally accepted standardized test or a comparable score on a criterion-referenced test; or

      (2) Is unable to compute or solve problems, read, write, or speak English at a level necessary to function on the job, in the individual's family or in society. (WIA secs. 101(19), 203(12).)

#### § § 664.210

      Definitions and eligibility documentation requirements regarding the “requires additional assistance to complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment” criterion of § 664.200(c)(6) may be established at the State or local level. In cases where the State Board establishes State policy on this criterion, the policy must be included in the State Plan. (WIA sec. 101(13)(C)(iv).)

      § 664.215   Must youth participants be registered to participate in the youth program?

#### § § 664.215

      (b) Registration is the process of collecting information to support a determination of eligibility.

      (c) Equal opportunity data must be collected during the registration process on any individual who has submitted personal information in response to a request by the recipient for such information.

      § 664.220   Is there an exception to permit youth who are not low-income individuals to receive youth services?

#### § § 664.220

      Yes, up to five percent of youth participants served by youth programs in a local area may be individuals who do not meet the income criterion for eligible youth, provided that they are within one or more of the following categories:

#### § § 664.230

      No, the barriers listed in §§ 664.200 and 664.220 are not the same. Both lists of eligibility barriers include school dropout, homeless or runaway, pregnant or parenting, and offender, but each list contains barriers not included on the other list.

      § 664.240   May a local program use eligibility for free lunches under the National School Lunch Program as a substitute for the income eligibility criteria under title I of WIA?

#### § § 664.240

#### § § 664.310

      A school dropout is defined as an individual who is no longer attending any school and who has not received a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent. A youth's dropout status is determined at the time of registration. A youth attending an alternative school at the time of registration is not a dropout. An individual who is out-of school at the time of registration and subsequently placed in an alternative school, may be considered an out-of-school youth for the purposes of the 30 percent expenditure requirement for out-of-school youth. (WIA sec. 101(39).)

      § 664.320   Does the requirement that at least 30 percent of youth funds be used to provide activities to out-of-school youth apply to all youth funds?

#### § § 664.320

      (a) Yes, the 30 percent requirement applies to the total amount of all funds allocated to a local area under WIA section 128(b)(2)(A) or (b)(3), except for local area expenditures for administrative purposes under 20 CFR 667.210(a)(2).

      (b) Although it is not necessary to ensure that 30 percent of such funds spent on summer employment opportunities (or any other particular element of the youth program) are spent on out-of-school youth, the funds spent on these activities are included in the total to which the 30 percent requirement applies.

      (c) There is a limited exception, at WIA section 129(c)(4)(B), under which certain small States may apply to the Secretary to reduce the minimum amount that must be spent on out-of-school youth. (WIA sec. 129(c)(4).)

    Subpart D—Youth Program Design, Elements, and Parameters

      § 664.400   What is a local youth program?

#### § § 664.400

      (2) Develop an individual service strategy for each youth participant that meets the requirements of WIA section 129(c)(1)(B), including identifying an age-appropriate career goal and consideration of the assessment results for each youth; and

      (3) Provide preparation for postsecondary educational opportunities, provide linkages between academic and occupational learning, provide preparation for employment, and provide effective connections to intermediary organizations that provide strong links to the job market and employers.

      (4) The requirement in WIA section 123 that eligible providers of youth services be selected by awarding a grant or contract on a competitive basis does not apply to the design framework component, such as services for intake, objective assessment and the development of individual service strategy, when these services are provided by the grant recipient/fiscal agent.

      (b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth program design in the local area, and how the ten program elements required in § 664.410 are provided within that framework.

      (c) Local Boards must ensure appropriate links to entities that will foster the participation of eligible local area youth. Such links may include connections to:

      (1) Local area justice and law enforcement officials;

      (2) Local public housing authorities;

      (3) Local education agencies;

      (4) Job Corps representatives; and

      (5) Representatives of other area youth initiatives, including those that serve homeless youth and other public and private youth initiatives.

      (1) Providing these youth with information regarding the full array of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local Board or other eligible providers, or One-Stop partners; and

      (2) Referring these youth to appropriate training and educational programs that have the capacity to serve them either on a sequential or concurrent basis.

      (e) In order to meet the basic skills and training needs of eligible applicants who do not meet the enrollment requirements of a particular program or who cannot be served by the program, each eligible youth provider must ensure that these youth are referred:

      (1) For further assessment, as necessary, and

      (2) To appropriate programs, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (f) Local Boards must ensure that parents, youth participants, and other members of the community with experience relating to youth programs are involved in both the design and implementation of its youth programs.

      (g) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the individual service strategy required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program provider determines that it is appropriate to use a recent objective assessment or individual service strategy that was developed under another education or training program. (WIA section 129(c)(1).)

      § 664.410   Must local programs include each of the ten program elements listed in WIA section 129(c)(2) as options available to youth participants?

      (f) Assistance with uniforms or other appropriate work attire and work-related tools, including such items as eye glasses and protective eye gear. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(G).)

      § 664.450   What are follow-up services for youth?

#### § § 664.450

      (a) Follow-up services for youth may include:

      (1) The leadership development and supportive service activities listed in §§ 664.420 and 664.440;

      (2) Regular contact with a youth participant's employer, including assistance in addressing work-related problems that arise;

      (3) Assistance in securing better paying jobs, career development and further education;

      (4) Work-related peer support groups;

      (5) Adult mentoring; and

      (6) Tracking the progress of youth in employment after training.

      (b) All youth participants must receive some form of follow-up services for a minimum duration of 12 months. Follow-up services may be provided beyond twelve (12) months at the State or Local Board's discretion. The types of services provided and the duration of services must be determined based on the needs of the individual. The scope of these follow-up services may be less intensive for youth who have only participated in summer youth employment opportunities. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(I).)

      § 664.460   What are work experiences for youth?

#### § § 664.460

      (a) Work experiences are planned, structured learning experiences that take place in a workplace for a limited period of time. As provided in WIA section 129(c)(2)(D) and § 664.470, work experiences may be paid or unpaid.

      (b) Work experience workplaces may be in the private, for-profit sector; the non-profit sector; or the public sector.

      (c) Work experiences are designed to enable youth to gain exposure to the working world and its requirements. Work experiences are appropriate and desirable activities for many youth throughout the year. Work experiences should help youth acquire the personal attributes, knowledge, and skills needed to obtain a job and advance in employment. The purpose is to provide the youth participant with the opportunities for career exploration and skill development and is not to benefit the employer, although the employer may, in fact, benefit from the activities performed by the youth. Work experiences may be subsidized or unsubsidized and may include the following elements:

      (1) Instruction in employability skills or generic workplace skills such as those identified by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS);

      (2) Exposure to various aspects of an industry;

      (3) Progressively more complex tasks;

      (4) Internships and job shadowing;

      (5) The integration of basic academic skills into work activities;

      (6) Supported work, work adjustment, and other transition activities;

      (7) Entrepreneurship;

      (8) Service learning;

      (9) Paid and unpaid community service; and

      (10) Other elements designed to achieve the goals of work experiences.

      (d) In most cases, on-the-job training is not an appropriate work experiences activity for youth participants under age 18. Local program operators may choose, however, to use this service strategy for eligible youth when it is appropriate based on the needs identified by the objective assessment of an individual youth participant. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(D).)

      § 664.470   Are paid work experiences allowable activities?

#### § § 664.470

      Funds under the Act may be used to pay wages and related benefits for work experiences in the public; private, for-profit or non-profit sectors where the objective assessment and individual service strategy indicate that work experiences are appropriate. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(D).)

    Subpart E—Concurrent Enrollment

      § 664.500   May youth participate in both youth and adult/dislocated worker programs concurrently?

#### § § 664.500

      (a) Yes, under the Act, eligible youth are 14 through 21 years of age. Adults are defined in the Act as individuals age 18 and older. Thus, individuals ages 18 through 21 may be eligible for both adult and youth programs. There is no specified age for the dislocated worker program.

      (b) Individuals who meet the respective eligibility requirements may participate in adult and youth programs concurrently. Concurrent enrollment is allowable for youth served in programs under WIA titles I or II. Such individuals must be eligible under the youth or adult/dislocated worker eligibility criteria applicable to the services received. Local program operators may determine, for individuals in this age group, the appropriate level and balance of services under the youth, adult, dislocated worker, or other services.

      (c) Local program operators must identify and track the funding streams which pay the costs of services provided to individuals who are participating in youth and adult/dislocated worker programs concurrently, and ensure that services are not duplicated.

      § 664.510   Are Individual Training Accounts allowed for youth participants?

#### § § 664.510

      No, however, individuals age 18 and above, who are eligible for training services under the adult and dislocated worker programs, may receive Individual Training Accounts through those programs. Requirements for concurrent participation requirements are set forth in § 664.500. To the extent possible, in order to enhance youth participant choice, youth participants should be involved in the selection of educational and training activities.

    Subpart F—Summer Employment Opportunities

      § 664.600   Are Local Boards required to offer summer employment opportunities in the local youth program?

#### § § 664.600

      (a) Yes, Local Boards are required to offer summer youth employment opportunities that link academic and occupational learning as part of the menu of services required in § 664.410(a).

      (b) Summer youth employment must provide direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may provide other elements and strategies as appropriate to serve the needs and goals of the participants.

      (c) Local Boards may determine how much of available youth funds will be used for summer and for year-round youth activities.

      (d) The summer youth employment opportunities element is not intended to be a stand-alone program. Local programs should integrate a youth's participation in that element into a comprehensive strategy for addressing the youth's employment and training needs. Youths who participate in summer employment opportunities must be provided with a minimum of twelve months of followup services, as required in § 664.450. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(C).)

      § 664.610   How is the summer employment opportunities element administered?

#### § § 664.610

      Chief elected officials and Local Boards are responsible for ensuring that the local youth program provides summer employment opportunities to youth. The chief elected officials (which may include local government units operating as a consortium) are the grant recipients for local youth funds, unless another entity is chosen to be grant recipient or fiscal agent under WIA section 117(d)(3)(B). If, in the administration of the summer employment opportunities element of the local youth program, providers other than the grant recipient/fiscal agent, are used to provide summer youth employment opportunities, these providers must be selected by awarding a grant or contract on a competitive basis, based on the recommendation of the youth council and on criteria contained in the State Plan. However, the selection of employers who are providing unsubsidized employment opportunities may be excluded from the competitive process. (WIA sec. 129(c)(2)(C).)

      § 664.620   Do the core indicators described in 20 CFR 666.100(a)(3) apply to participation in summer employment activities?

#### § § 664.620

      Yes, the summer employment opportunities element is one of a number of activities authorized by the WIA youth program. WIA section 136(b)(2) (A)(ii) and(B) provides specific core indicators of performance for youth, and requires that all participating youth be included in the determination of whether the local levels of performance are met. Program operators can help ensure positive outcomes for youth participants by providing them with continuity of services.

    Subpart G—One-Stop Services to Youth

      § 664.700   What is the connection between the youth program and the One-Stop service delivery system?

#### § § 664.700

      (a) The chief elected official (or designee, under WIA section 117(d)(3)(B)), as the local grant recipient for the youth program is a required One-Stop partner and is subject to the requirements that apply to such partners, described in 20 CFR part 662.

      (b) In addition to the provisions of 20 CFR part 662, connections between the youth program and the One-Stop system may include those that facilitate:

      (1) The coordination and provision of youth activities;

      (2) Linkages to the job market and employers;

      (3) Access for eligible youth to the information and services required in §§ 664.400 and 664.410; and

      (4) Other activities designed to achieve the purposes of the youth program and youth activities as described in WIA section 129(a). (WIA secs. 121(b)(1)(B)(i); 129.)

      § 664.710   Do Local Boards have the flexibility to offer services to area youth who are not eligible under the youth program through the One-Stop centers?

#### § § 664.710

      Yes, however, One-Stop services for non-eligible youth must be funded by programs that are authorized to provide services to such youth. For example, basic labor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act may be provided to any youth.

    Subpart H—Youth Opportunity Grants

      § 664.800   How are the recipients of Youth Opportunity Grants selected?

#### § § 664.800

      (a) Youth Opportunity Grants are awarded through a competitive selection process. The Secretary establishes appropriate application procedures, selection criteria, and an approval process for awarding Youth Opportunity Grants to applicants which can accomplish the purpose of the Act and use available funds in an effective manner in the Solicitation for Grant Applications announcing the competition.

      (b) The Secretary distributes grants equitably among urban and rural areas by taking into consideration such factors as the following:

      (1) The poverty rate in urban and rural communities;

      (2) The number of people in poverty in urban and rural communities; and

      (3) The quality of proposals received. (WIA sec.169(a) and (e).)

      § 664.810   How does a Local Board or other entity become eligible to receive a Youth Opportunity Grant?

#### § § 664.810

      (a) A Local Board is eligible to receive a Youth Opportunity Grant if it serves a community that:

      (1) Has been designated as an empowerment zone (EZ) or enterprise community (EC) under section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

      (2) Is located in a State that does not have an EZ or an EC and that has been designated by its Governor as a high poverty area; or

      (3) Is one of two areas in a State that has been designated by the Governor as an area for which a local board may apply for a Youth Opportunity Grant, and that meets the poverty rate criteria in section 1392 (a)(4), (b), and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

      (b) An entity other than a Local Board is eligible to receive a grant if that entity:

      (1) Is a WIA Indian and Native American grant recipient under WIA section 166; and

      (2) Serves a community that:

      (i) Meets the poverty rate criteria in section 1392(a)(4), (b), and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and

      (ii) Is located on an Indian reservation or serves Oklahoma Indians or Alaska Native villages or Native groups, as provided in WIA section 169 (d)(2)(B). (WIA sec. 169(c) and (d).)

      § 664.820   Who is eligible to receive services under Youth Opportunity Grants?

#### § § 664.820

      All individuals ages 14 through 21 who reside in the community identified in the grant are eligible to receive services under the grant. (WIA sec. 169(a).)

      § 664.830   How are performance measures for Youth Opportunity Grants determined?

#### § § 664.830

      (a) The Secretary negotiates performance measures, including appropriate performance levels for each indicator, with each selected grantee, based on information contained in the application.

      (b) Performance indicators for the measures negotiated under Youth Opportunity Grants are the indicators of performance provided in WIA sections 136(b)(2)(A) and (B). (WIA sec. 169(f).).

      (4) Reemployment prospects for workers in the local community; and

      (5) Available resources to meet the short and long-term assistance needs of the affected workers.

      (b) The provision of information and access to unemployment compensation benefits, comprehensive One-Stop system services, and employment and training activities, including information on the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and the NAFTA-TAA program (19 U.S.C. 2271 );

      (c) The provision of guidance and/or financial assistance in establishing a labor-management committee voluntarily agreed to by labor and management, or a workforce transition committee comprised of representatives of the employer, the affected workers and the local community. The committee may devise and oversee an implementation strategy that responds to the reemployment needs of the workers. The assistance to this committee may include:

      (1) The provision of training and technical assistance to members of the committee;

      (2) Funding the operating costs of a committee to enable it to provide advice and assistance in carrying out rapid response activities and in the design and delivery of WIA-authorized services to affected workers. Typically, such support will last no longer than six months; and

      (3) Providing a list of potential candidates to serve as a neutral chairperson of the committee.

      (d) The provision of emergency assistance adapted to the particular closing, layoff or disaster.

      (e) The provision of assistance to the local board and chief elected official(s) to develop a coordinated response to the dislocation event and, as needed, obtain access to State economic development assistance. Such coordinated response may include the development of an application for National Emergency Grant under 20 CFR part 671. (WIA secs. 101(38) and 134(a)(2)(A).)

      § 665.320   May other activities be undertaken as part of rapid response?

#### § § 665.320

      Yes, a State or designated entity may provide rapid response activities in addition to the activities required to be provided under § 665.310. In order to provide effective rapid response upon notification of a permanent closure or mass layoff, or a natural or other disaster resulting in a mass job dislocation, the State or designated entity may:

      (a) In conjunction, with other appropriate Federal, State and Local agencies and officials, employer associations, technical councils or other industry business councils, and labor organizations:

      (1) Develop prospective strategies for addressing dislocation events, that ensure rapid access to the broad range of allowable assistance;

      (2) Identify strategies for the aversion of layoffs; and

      (3) Develop and maintain mechanisms for the regular exchange of information relating to potential dislocations, available adjustment assistance, and the effectiveness of rapid response strategies.

      (b) In collaboration with the appropriate State agency(ies), collect and analyze information related to economic dislocations, including potential closings and layoffs, and all available resources in the State for dislocated workers in order to provide an adequate basis for effective program management, review and evaluation of rapid response and layoff aversion efforts in the State.

      (c) Participate in capacity building activities, including providing information about innovative and successful strategies for serving dislocated workers, with local areas serving smaller layoffs.

      (d) Assist in devising and overseeing strategies for:

      (1) Layoff aversion, such as prefeasibility studies of avoiding a plant closure through an option for a company or group, including the workers, to purchase the plant or company and continue it in operation;

      (2) Incumbent worker training, including employer loan programs for employee skill upgrading; and

      (3) Linkages with economic development activities at the Federal, State and local levels, including Federal Department of Commerce programs and available State and local business retention and recruitment activities.

      § 665.330   Are the NAFTA-TAA program requirements for rapid response also required activities?

#### § § 665.330

      The Governor must ensure that rapid response activities under WIA are made available to workers who, under the NAFTA Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182), are members of a group of workers (including those in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) for which the Governor has made a preliminary finding that:

      (a) A significant number or proportion of the workers in such firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated; and

      (b) Either:

      (1) The sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely; and

      (2) Imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by such firm or subdivision have increased; or

      (c) There has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.

      § 665.340   What is meant by “provision of additional assistance” in WIA section 134(a)(2)(A)(ii)?

#### § § 665.340

      Up to 25 percent of dislocated worker funds may be reserved for rapid response activities. Once the State has reserved adequate funds for rapid response activities, such as those described in §§ 665.310 and 665.320, the remainder of the funds may be used by the State to provide funds to local areas, that experience increased numbers of unemployed individuals due to natural disasters, plant closings, mass layoffs or other events, for provision of direct services to participants (such as intensive, training, and other services) if there are not adequate local funds available to assist the dislocated workers.

      § 666.110   May a Governor require additional indicators of performance?

#### § § 666.110

      Yes, Governors may develop additional indicators of performance for adults, youth and dislocated worker activities. These indicators must be included in the State Plan. (WIA sec. 136(b)(2)(C).)

      § 666.120   What are the procedures for negotiating annual levels of performance?

#### § § 666.120

      (a) We issue instructions on the specific information that must accompany the State Plan and that is used to review the State's expected levels of performance. The instructions may require that levels of performance for years two and three be expressed as a percentage improvement over the immediately preceding year's performance, consistent with the objective of continuous improvement.

      (b) States must submit expected levels of performance for the required indicators for each of the first three program years covered by the Plan.

      (c) The Secretary and the Governor must reach agreement on levels of performance for each core indicator and the customer satisfaction indicators. In negotiating these levels, the following must be taken into account:

      (1) The expected levels of performance identified in the State Plan;

      (2) The extent to which the levels of performance for each core indicator assist in achieving high customer satisfaction;

      (3) The extent to which the levels of performance promote continuous improvement and ensure optimal return on the investment of Federal funds; and

      (4) How the levels compare with those of other States, taking into account factors including differences in economic conditions, participant characteristics, and the proposed service mix and strategies.

      (d) The levels of performance agreed to under paragraph (c) of this section will be the State's negotiated levels of performance for the first three years of the State Plan. These levels will be used to determine whether sanctions will be applied or incentive grant funds will be awarded.

      (e) Before the fourth year of the State Plan, the Secretary and the Governor must reach agreement on levels of performance for each core indicator and the customer satisfaction indicators for the fourth and fifth years covered by the plan. In negotiating these levels, the factors listed in paragraph (c) of this section must be taken into account.

      (f) The levels of performance agreed to under paragraph (e) of this section will be the State negotiated levels of performance for the fourth and fifth years of the plan and must be incorporated into the State Plan.

      (g) Levels of performance for the additional indicators developed by the Governor, including additional indicators to demonstrate and measure continuous improvement toward goals identified by the State, are not part of the negotiations described in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section. (WIA sec. 136(b)(3).)

      (h) State negotiated levels of performance may be revised in accordance with § 666.130.

      § 666.130   Under what conditions may a State or DOL request revisions to the State negotiated levels of performance?

#### § § 666.130

      (a) The DOL guidelines describe when and under what circumstances a Governor may request revisions to negotiated levels. These circumstances include significant changes in economic conditions, in the characteristics of participants entering the program, or in the services to be provided from when the initial plan was submitted and approved. (WIA sec. 136(b)(3)(A)(vi).)

      (b) The guidelines will establish the circumstances under which a State will be required to submit revisions under specified circumstances.

      § 666.140   Which individuals receiving services are included in the core indicators of performance?

#### § § 666.140

      (a)(1) The core indicators of performance apply to all individuals who are registered under 20 CFR 663.105 and 664.215 for the adult, dislocated worker and youth programs, except for those adults and dislocated workers who participate exclusively in self-service or informational activities. (WIA sec. 136(b)(2)(A).)

      (2) Self-service and informational activities are those core services that are made available and accessible to the general public, that are designed to inform and educate individuals about the labor market and their employment strengths, weaknesses, and the range of services appropriate to their situation, and that do not require significant staff involvement with the individual in terms of resources or time.

      (b) For registered participants, a standardized record that includes appropriate performance information must be maintained in accordance with WIA section 185(a)(3).

      (c) Performance will be measured on the basis of results achieved by registered participants, and will reflect services provided under WIA title I, subtitle B programs for adults, dislocated workers and youth. Performance may also take into account services provided to participants by other One-Stop partner programs and activities, to the extent that the local MOU provides for the sharing of participant information.

      § 666.150   What responsibility do States have to use quarterly wage record information for performance accountability?

#### § § 666.150

      (a) States must, consistent with State laws, use quarterly wage record information in measuring the progress on State and local performance measures. In order to meet this requirement the use of social security numbers from registered participants and such other information as is necessary to measure the progress of those participants through quarterly wage record information is authorized.

      (b) The State must include in the State Plan a description of the State's performance accountability system, and a description of the State's strategy for using quarterly wage record information to measure the progress on State and local performance measures. The description must identify the entities that may have access to quarterly wage record information for this purpose.

      (c) “Quarterly wage record information” means information regarding wages paid to an individual, the social security account number (or numbers, if more than one) of the individual and the name, address, State, and (when known) the Federal employer identification number of the employer paying the wages to the individual. (WIA sec. 136(f)(2).)

#### § § 666.210

      Incentive grant funds are awarded to States to carry out any one or more innovative programs under titles I or II of WIA or the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act, regardless of which Act is the source of the incentive funds. (WIA sec. 503(a).)

      § 666.220   What information must be included in a State Board's application for an Incentive Grant?

#### § § 666.220

      (a) After consultation with the Secretary of Education, we will issue instructions annually which will include the amount of funds available to be awarded for each State and provide instructions for submitting applications for an Incentive Grant.

      (b) Each State desiring an incentive grant must submit to the Secretary an application, developed by the State Board, containing the following assurances:

      (1) The State legislature was consulted regarding the development of the application.

      (2) The application was approved by the Governor, the eligible agency (as defined in WIA section 203), and the State agency responsible for vocational and technical programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act.

      (3) The State exceeded the State negotiated levels of performance for title I, the levels of performance under title II and the levels for vocational and technical programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act. (WIA sec. 503(b).)

      § 666.230   How does the Department determine the amounts for Incentive Grant awards?

#### § § 666.230

      (a) We determine the total amount to be allocated from funds available under WIA section 174(b) for Incentive Grants taking into consideration such factors as:

      (1) The availability of funds under section 174(b) for technical assistance, demonstration and pilot projects, evaluations, and Incentive Grants and the needs for these activities;

      (2) The number of States that are eligible for Incentive Grants and their relative program formula allocations under title I;

      (3) The availability of funds under WIA section 136(g)(2) resulting from funds withheld for poor performance by States; and

      (4) The range of awards established in WIA section 503(c).

      (b) We will publish the award amount for eligible States, after consultation with the Secretary of Education, within 90 days after the due date, established under § 666.205(a), for the latest State performance progress report providing the annual information needed to determine State eligibility.

      (1) The relative allocations of the eligible State compared to other States;

      (2) The extent to which the negotiated levels of performance were exceeded;

      (3) Performance improvement relative to previous years;

      (4) Changes in economic conditions, participant characteristics and proposed service design since the negotiated levels of performance were agreed to;

      (5) The eligible State's relative performance for each of the indicators compared to other States; and

      (6) The performance on those indicators considered most important in terms of accomplishing national goals established by each of the respective Secretaries.

      § 666.240   Under what circumstances may a sanction be applied to a State that fails to achieve negotiated levels of performance for title I?

#### § § 666.240

      (a) If a State fails to meet the negotiated levels of performance agreed to under § 666.120 for core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for the adult, dislocated worker or youth programs under title I of WIA, the Secretary must, upon request, provide technical assistance, as authorized under WIA sections 136(g) and 170.

      (b) If a State fails to meet the negotiated levels of performance for core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for the same program in two successive years, the amount of the succeeding year's allocation for the applicable program may be reduced by up to five percent.

      (c) The exact amount of any allocation reduction will be based upon the degree of failure to meet the negotiated levels of performance for core indicators. In making a determination of the amount, if any, of such a sanction, we may consider factors such as:

      (1) The State's performance relative to other States;

      (2) Improvement efforts underway;

The technical assistance must be provided by the Governor with funds reserved for Statewide workforce investment activities under WIA sections 128(a) and 133(a)(1), or, upon the Governor's request, by the Secretary. The technical assistance may include the development of a performance improvement plan, a modified local plan, or other actions designed to assist the local area in improving performance.

      (b) If a local area fails to meet the levels of performance agreed to under § 666.310 for the core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for a program for two consecutive program years, the Governor must take corrective actions. The corrective actions may include the development of a reorganization plan under which the Governor:

      (1) Requires the appointment and certification of a new Local Board;

      (2) Prohibits the use of particular service providers or One-Stop partners that have been identified as achieving poor levels of performance; or

      (3) Requires other appropriate measures designed to improve the performance of the local area.

      (c) A local area may appeal to the Governor to rescind or revise a reorganization plan imposed under paragraph (b) of this section not later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the plan.

      § 667.130   How are WIA title I formula funds allocated to local workforce investment areas?

#### § § 667.130

      (a)  The Governor must allocate WIA formula funds allotted for services to youth, adults and dislocated workers in accordance with WIA sections 128 and 133, and this section.

      (1) State Boards must assist Governors in the development of any discretionary within-State allocation formulas. (WIA sec. 111(d)(5).)

      (2) Within-State allocations must be made:

      (i) In accordance with the allocation formulas contained in WIA sections 128(b) and 133(b) and in the State workforce investment plan, and

      (ii) After consultation with chief elected officials in each of the workforce investment areas.

      (b)  (1) Of the WIA formula funds allotted for services to youth, adults and dislocated workers, the Governor must reserve funds from each of these sources for Statewide workforce investment activities. In making these reservations, the Governor may reserve up to fifteen (15) percent from each of these sources. Funds reserved under this paragraph may be combined and spent on Statewide employment and training activities, for adults and dislocated workers, and Statewide youth activities, as described in 20 CFR 665.200 and 665.210, without regard to the funding source of the reserved funds.

      (2) The Governor must reserve a portion of the dislocated worker funds for Statewide rapid response activities, as described in WIA section 134(a)(2)(A) and 20 CFR 665.310 through 665.330. In making this reservation, the Governor may reserve up to twenty-five (25) percent of the dislocated worker funds.

      (c)  (1) Unless the Governor elects to distribute funds in accordance with the discretionary allocation formula described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the remainder of youth funds not reserved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be allocated:

      (i) 33  percent on the basis of the relative number of unemployed individuals in areas of substantial unemployment in each workforce investment area, compared to the total number of unemployed individuals in all areas of substantial unemployment in the State;

      (ii) 33  percent on the basis of the relative excess number of unemployed individuals in each workforce investment area, compared to the total excess number of unemployed individuals in the State; and

      (iii) 33  percent on the basis of the relative number of disadvantaged youth in each workforce investment area, compared to the total number of disadvantaged youth in the State. (WIA sec. 128(b)(2)(A)(i))

      (2)  In lieu of making the formula allocation described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the State may allocate youth funds under a discretionary formula. Under that formula, the State must allocate a minimum of 70 percent of youth funds not reserved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the basis of the formula in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and may allocate up to 30 percent on the basis of a formula that:

      (i) Incorporates additional factors (other than the factors described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) relating to:

      (A) Excess youth poverty in urban, rural and suburban local areas; and

      (B) Excess unemployment above the State average in urban, rural and suburban local areas; and

      (ii) Was developed by the State Board and approved by the Secretary of Labor as part of the State workforce investment plan. (WIA sec. 128(b)(3).)

      (d)  (1) Unless the Governor elects to distribute funds in accordance with the discretionary allocation formula described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the remainder of adult funds not reserved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be allocated:

      (i) 33  percent on the basis of the relative number of unemployed individuals in areas of substantial unemployment in each workforce investment area, compared to the total number of unemployed individuals in areas of substantial unemployment in the State;

      (ii) 33  percent on the basis of the relative excess number of unemployed individuals in each workforce investment area, compared to the total excess number of unemployed individuals in the State; and

      (4)(i) Dislocated worker funds initially reserved by the Governor for Statewide rapid response activities in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be:

      (A) Distributed to local areas, and

      (B) Used to operate projects in local areas in accordance with the requirements of WIA section 134(a)(2)(A) and 20 CFR 665.310 through 665.330.

#### § § 667.135

      (a)(1) For the first two fiscal years after the date on which a local area is designated under section 116 of WIA, the State may elect to apply the “hold harmless” provisions specified in paragraph (b) of this section to local area allocations of WIA youth funds under § 667.130(c) and to allocations of WIA adult funds under § 667.130(d).

      (2) Effective at the end of the second full fiscal year after the date on which a local area is designated under section 116 of WIA the State must apply the “hold harmless” specified in paragraph (b) of this section to local area allocations of WIA youth funds under § 667.130(c) and to allocations of WIA adult funds under § 667.130(d).

      (3) There are no “hold harmless” provisions that apply to local area allocations of WIA dislocated worker funds.

      (b)(1) If a State elects to apply a “hold-harmless” under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a local area must not receive an allocation amount for a fiscal year that is less than 90 percent of the average allocation of the local area for the two preceding fiscal years.

      (2) In applying the “hold harmless” under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a local area must not receive an allocation amount for a fiscal year that is less than 90 percent of the average allocation of the local area for the two preceding fiscal years.

      (3) Amounts necessary to increase allocations to local areas must be obtained by ratably reducing the allocations to be made to other local areas.

      (4) If the amounts of WIA funds appropriated in a fiscal year are not sufficient to provide the amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to all local areas, the amounts allocated to each local area mustbe ratably reduced. (WIA secs. 128(b)(2)(A)(ii), 133(b)(2)(A)(ii), 506.)

      § 667.140   Does a Local Board have the authority to transfer funds between programs?

#### § § 667.140

      (a) A Local Board may transfer up to 20 percent of a program year allocation for adult employment and training activities, and up to 20 percent of a program year allocation for dislocated worker employment and training activities between the two programs.

      (b) Before making any such transfer, a Local Board must obtain the Governor's approval.

      (c) Local Boards may not transfer funds to or from the youth program.

      § 667.150   What reallotment procedures does the Secretary use?

#### § § 667.150

      (a) The first reallotment of funds among States will occur during PY 2001 based on obligations in PY 2000.

      (b) The Secretary determines, during the first quarter of the program year, whether a State has obligated its required level of at least 80 percent of the funds allotted under WIA sections 127 and 132 for programs serving youth, adults, and dislocated workers for the prior year, as separately determined for each of the three funding streams. Unobligated balances are determined based on allotments adjusted for any allowable transfer between the adult and dislocated worker funding streams. The amount to be recaptured from each State for reallotment, if any, is based on State obligations of the funds allotted to each State under WIA sections 127 and 132 for programs serving youth, adults, or dislocated workers, less any amount reserved (up to 5 percent at the State level and up to 10 percent at the local level) for the costs of administration. This amount, if any, is separately determined for each funding stream.

      (c) The Secretary reallots youth, adult and dislocated worker funds among eligible States in accordance with the provisions of WIA sections 127(c) and 132(c), respectively. To be eligible to receive a reallotment of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds under the reallotment procedures, a State must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allotment, less any amount reserved for the costs of administration of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds. A State's eligibility to receive a reallotment is separately determined for each funding stream.

      (d) The term “obligation” is defined at 20 CFR 660.300. For purposes of this section, the Secretary will also treat as State obligations:

      (1) Amounts allocated by the State, under WIA sections 128(b) and 133(b), to the single State local area if the State has been designated as a single local area under WIA section 116(b) or to a balance of State local area administered by a unit of the State government, and

      (2) Inter-agency transfers and other actions treated by the State as encumbrances against amounts reserved by the State under WIA sections 128(a) and 133(a) for Statewide workforce investment activities.

      § 667.160   What reallocation procedures must the Governors use?

#### § § 667.160

      (a) The Governor may reallocate youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds among local areas within the State in accordance with the provisions of sections 128(c) and 133(c) of the Act. If the Governor chooses to reallocate funds, the provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply.

      (b) For the youth, adult and dislocated worker programs, the amount to be recaptured from each local area for purposes of reallocation, if any, must be based on the amount by which the prior year's unobligated balance of allocated funds exceeds 20 percent of that year's allocation for the program, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration. Unobligated balances must be determined based on allocations adjusted for any allowable transfer between funding streams. This amount, if any, must be separately determined for each funding stream.

      (c) To be eligible to receive youth, adult or dislocated worker funds under the reallocation procedures, a local area must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allocation, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration, for youth, adult, or dislocated worker activities, as separately determined. A local area's eligibility to receive a reallocation must be separately determined for each funding stream.

      § 667.170   What responsibility review does the Department conduct for awards made under WIA title I, subtitle D?

#### § § 667.170

      (a) Before final selection as a potential grantee, we conduct a review of the available records to assess the organization's overall responsibility to administer Federal funds. As part of this review, we may consider any information that has come to our attention and will consider the organization's history with regard to the management of other grants, including DOL grants. The failure to meet any one responsibility test, except for those listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, does not establish that the organization is not responsible unless the failure is substantial or persistent (for two or more consecutive years). The responsibility tests include:

      (1) The organization's efforts to recover debts (for which three demand letters have been sent) established by final agency action have been unsuccessful, or that there has been failure to comply with an approved repayment plan;

      (2) Established fraud or criminal activity of a significant nature within the organization.

      (3) Serious administrative deficiencies that we identify, such as failure to maintain a financial management system as required by Federal regulations;

      (4) Willful obstruction of the audit process;

      (5) Failure to provide services to applicants as agreed to in a current or recent grant or to meet applicable performance standards;

      (6) Failure to correct deficiencies brought to the grantee's attention in writing as a result of monitoring activities, reviews, assessments, or other activities;

      (7) Failure to return a grant closeout package or outstanding advances within 90 days of the grant expiration date or receipt of closeout package, whichever is later, unless an extension has been requested and granted; final billings reflecting serious cost category or total budget cost overrun;

      (8) Failure to submit required reports;

      (9) Failure to properly report and dispose of government property as instructed by DOL;

      (10) Failure to have maintained effective cash management or cost controls resulting in excess cash on hand;

      (11) Failure to ensure that a subrecipient complies with its OMB Circular A-133 audit requirements specified at § 667.200(b);

      (12) Failure to audit a subrecipient within the required period;

      (13) Final disallowed costs in excess of five percent of the grant or contract award if, in the judgement of the grant officer, the disallowances are egregious findings and;

      (14) Failure to establish a mechanism to resolve a subrecipient's audit in a timely fashion.

      (b) This responsibility review is independent of the competitive process. Applicants which are determined to be not responsible will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.

    Subpart B—Administrative Rules, Costs and Limitations

      (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) through (7) of this section, institutions of higher education, hospitals, other non-profit organizations, and commercial organizations must the follow the common rule implementing OMB Circular A-110 which is codified at 2 CFR part 215 and 29 CFR part 95.

      (3) In addition to the requirements at 29 CFR 95.48 or 29 CFR 97.36(i) (as appropriate), all procurement contracts and other transactions between Local Boards and units of State or local governments must be conducted only on a cost reimbursement basis. No provision for profit is allowed. (WIA sec. 184(a)(3)(B).)

      (4) In addition to the requirements at 29 CFR 95.42 or 29 CFR 97.36(b)(3) (as appropriate), which address codes of conduct and conflict of interest issues related to employees:

      (i) A State Board member or a Local Board member or a Youth Council member must neither cast a vote on, nor participate in any decision-making capacity, on the provision of services by such member (or any organization which that member directly represents), nor on any matter which would provide any direct financial benefit to that member or a member of his immediate family.

      (ii) Neither membership on the State Board, the Local Board, the Youth Council nor the receipt of WIA funds to provide training and related services, by itself, violates these conflict of interest provisions.

      (5) The addition method, described at 29 CFR 95.24 or 29 CFR 97.25(g)(2) (as appropriate), must be used for the all program income earned under WIA title I grants.

      (ii) If their use does not affect the ability of eligible participants to use the services, facilities, or equipment; and

      (iii) If the income generated from such fees is used to carry out programs authorized under this title.

      (b)  (1) All governmental and non-profit organizations must follow the audit requirements of OMB Circular A-133. These requirements are found at 29 CFR 97.26 for governmental organizations and at 29 CFR 95.26 for institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations.

      (2)(i) We are responsible for audits of commercial organizations which are direct recipients of Federal financial assistance under WIA title I.

      (ii) Commercial organizations which are subrecipients under WIA title I and which expend more than the minimum level specified in OMB Circular A-133 ($300,000 ($500,000 for years ending after December 21, 2003)) must have either an organization-wide audit conducted in accordance with A-133 or a program specific financial and compliance audit.

      (c)  All recipients and subrecipients must follow the Federal allowable cost principles that apply to their kind of organizations. The DOL regulations at 29 CFR 95.27 and 29 CFR 97.22 identify the Federal principles for determining allowable costs which each kind of recipient and subrecipient must follow. The applicable Federal principles for each kind of recipient are described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section; all recipients must comply with paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of this section. For those selected items of cost requiring prior approval, the authority to grant or deny approval is delegated to the Governor for programs funded under sections 127 or 132 of the Act.

      (5) Allowable costs for commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-122 must be determined under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), at 48 CFR part 31.

      (6) For all types of entities, legal expenses for the prosecution of claims against the Federal Government, including appeals to an Administrative Law Judge, are unallowable.

      (d)  All WIA title I grant recipients and subrecipients must comply with the government-wide requirements for debarment and suspension, and the government-wide requirements for a drug-free workplace, codified at 29 CFR part 98.

      (e)  All WIA title I grant recipients and subrecipients must comply with the restrictions on lobbying which are codified in the DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 93.

      (f)  All WIA title I recipients, as the term is defined in 29 CFR 37.4, must comply with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIA section 188 and its implementing regulations found at 29 CFR part 37.

      (2) If a State intends to impose different reporting requirements, it must describe those reporting requirements in its State WIA plan.

      (c)  (1) Each grant recipient must submit financial reports.

      (2) Reports must include any income or profits earned, including such income or profits earned by subrecipients, and any costs incurred (such as stand-in costs) that are otherwise allowable except for funding limitations. (WIA sec. 185(f)(2))

      (3) Reported expenditures and program income, including any profits earned, must be on the accrual basis of accounting and cumulative by fiscal year of appropriation. If the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis of accounting, the recipient must develop accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand.

      (d)  Financial reports and participant data reports are due no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter unless otherwise specified in reporting instructions. A final financial report is required 90 days after the expiration of a funding period or the termination of grant support.

      (e)  An annual performance progress report for each of the three programs under title I, subpart B is required by WIA section 136(d).

      (1) A State failing to submit any of these annual performance progress reports within 45 days of the due date may have its grant (for that program or all title I, subpart B programs) for the succeeding year reduced by as much as five percent, as provided by WIA section 136(g)(1)(B).

      (2) States submitting annual performance progress reports that cannot be validated or verified as accurately counting and reporting activities in accordance with the reporting instructions, may be treated as failing to submit annual reports, and be subject to sanction. Sanctions related to State performance or failure to submit these reports timely cannot result in a total grant reduction of more than five percent. Any sanction would be in addition to having to repay the amount of any incentive funds granted based on the invalid report.

    Subpart D—Oversight and Monitoring

Federal oversight will be conducted primarily at the recipient level.

      (b) In each fiscal year, we will also conduct in-depth reviews in several States, including financial and performance audits, to assure that funds are spent in accordance with the Act. Priority for such in-depth reviews will be given to States not meeting annual adjusted levels of performance.

      (c)(1) Each recipient and subrecipient must continuously monitor grant-supported activities in accordance with the uniform administrative requirements at 29 CFR parts 95 and 97, as applicable, including the applicable cost principles indicated at 29 CFR 97.22(b) or 29 CFR 95.27, for all entities receiving WIA title I funds.

    Subpart E—Resolution of Findings From Monitoring and Oversight Reviews

      § 667.500   What procedures apply to the resolution of findings arising from audits, investigations, monitoring and oversight reviews?

#### § § 667.500

      (a)  (1) The Governor is responsible for resolving findings that arise from the State's monitoring reviews, investigations and audits (including OMB Circular A-133 audits) of subrecipients.

      (2) A State must utilize the audit resolution, debt collection and appeal procedures that it uses for other Federal grant programs.

      (3) If a State does not have such procedures, it must prescribe standards and procedures to be used for this grant program.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary is responsible for resolving findings that arise from Federal audits, monitoring reviews, investigations, incident reports, and recipient level OMB Circular A-133 audits.

      (2) The Secretary uses the DOL audit resolution process, consistent with the Single Audit Act of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, and Grant Officer Resolution provisions of § 667.510, as appropriate.

      (3) A final determination issued by a Grant Officer under this process may be appealed to the DOL Office of Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at § 667.800.

      (c)  Findings arising from investigations or reviews conducted under nondiscrimination laws will be resolved in accordance with WIA section 188 and the Department of Labor nondiscrimination regulations implementing WIA section 188, codified at 29 CFR part 37.

      § 667.505   How do we resolve investigative and monitoring findings?

#### § § 667.505

      (a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit or other monitoring, we notify the recipient of the findings of the investigation and gives the recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take appropriate corrective actions.

      (b) The Grant Officer reviews the complete file of the investigation or monitoring report and the recipient's actions under paragraph (a) of this section. The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of WIA section 184(b) and (c). If the Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of the situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient. This notification constitutes final agency action.

      (c) If the Grant Officer disagrees with the recipient's handling of the matter, the Grant Officer proceeds under § 667.510.

      § 667.510   What is the Grant Officer resolution process?

#### § § 667.510

      (a)  When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the State's disposition of an audit or other resolution of violations (including those arising out of incident reports or compliance reviews), or with the recipient's response to findings resulting from investigations or monitoring report, the initial and final determination process, set forth in this section, is used to resolve the matter.

      (b)  The Grant Officer makes an initial determination on the findings for both those matters where there is agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's resolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of the Act and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants, contracts, or other agreements under the Act.

      (c)  Except in an emergency situation, when the Secretary invokes the authority described in WIA section 184(e), the Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, nor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments to resolve informally those matters in controversy contained in the initial determination. The initial determination must provide for an informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial determination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant Officer must issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which notifies the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the file.

      (d)  (1) If the matter is not fully resolved informally, the Grant Officer provides each party with a written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested. For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients which receive WIA funds directly from DOL, ordinarily, the final determination is issued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved audit report to the Employment and Training Administration. For audits of subrecipients conducted by the OIG, ordinarily the final determination is issued not later than 360 days from the date the OIG issues the final approved audit report to ETA.

      (2) A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:

      (i) Indicate whether efforts to informally resolve matters contained in the initial determination have been unsuccessful;

      (ii) List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;

      (iii) List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions set forth in the initial determination and the rationale for such modifications;

      (iv) Establish a debt, if appropriate;

      (v) Require corrective action, when needed;

      (vi) Determine liability, method of restitution of funds and sanctions; and

      (vii) Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with § 667.800 of this part.

      (3) Unless a hearing is requested, a final determination under this paragraph (d) is final agency action and is not subject to further review.

      (e) Nothing in this subpart precludes the Grant Officer from issuing an initial determination and/or final determination directly to a subrecipient, in accordance with section 184(d)(3) of the Act. In such a case, the Grant Officer will inform the recipient of this action.

#### § § 667.700

      (a)(1) Except for actions under WIA section 188(a) or 29 CFR part 37 (relating to nondiscrimination requirements), the Grant Officer uses the initial and final determination procedures outlined in § 667.510 to impose a sanction or corrective action.

      (2) To impose a sanction or corrective action for a violation of WIA section 188(a) or 29 CFR part 37, the Department will use the procedures set forth in that regulatory part.

      (b) To impose a sanction or corrective action for noncompliance with the uniform administrative requirements set forth at section 184(a)(3) of WIA, and § 667.200(a), when the Grant Officer determines that the Governor has not taken corrective action to remedy the violation as required by WIA section 184(a)(5), the Grant Officer, under the authority of WIA section 184(a)(7) and § 667.710(c), must require the Governor to impose any of the corrective actions set forth at WIA section 184(b)(1). If the Governor fails to impose the corrective actions required by the Grant Officer, the Secretary may immediately suspend or terminate financial assistance in accordance with WIA section 184(e).

      (c) For substantial violations of WIA statutory and regulatory requirements, if the Governor fails to promptly take the actions specified in WIA section 184(b)(1), the Grant Officer may impose such actions directly against the local area.

      (d) The Grant Officer may also impose a sanction directly against a subrecipient, as authorized in section 184(d)(3) of the Act. In such a case, the Grant Officer will inform the recipient of the action.

      (c) When a local workforce area is composed of more than one unit of general local government, the liability of the individual jurisdictions must be specified in a written agreement between the chief elected officials.

      § 667.710   What actions are required to address the failure of a local area to comply with the applicable uniform administrative provisions?

#### § § 667.710

      (a) If, as part of the annual on-site monitoring of local areas, the Governor determines that a local area is not in compliance with the uniform administrative requirements found at 29 CFR part 95 or part 97, as appropriate, the Governor must:

      (1) Require corrective action to secure prompt compliance; and

      (2) Impose the sanctions provided for at section 184(b) if the Governor finds that the local area has failed to take timely corrective action.

      (b) An action by the recipient to impose a sanction against a local area, in accordance with this section, may be appealed to the Secretary in accordance with § 667.650, and will not become effective until:

      (1) The time for appeal has expired; or

      (2) The Secretary has issued a decision.

      (c)(1) If the Secretary finds that the Governor has failed to monitor and certify compliance of local areas with the administrative requirements, under WIA section 184(a), or that the Governor has failed to promptly take the actions required upon a determination under paragraph (a) of this section that a local area is not in compliance with the uniform administrative requirements, the Secretary will require the Governor to take corrective actions against the State recipient or the local area, as appropriate to ensure prompt compliance.

#### § § 667.720

      (a) A recipient may request a waiver of liability, as described in WIA section 184(d)(2), and a Grant Officer may approve such a waiver under WIA section 184(d)(3).

      (b)(1) When the debt for which a waiver of liability is desired was established in a non-Federal resolution proceeding, the resolution report must accompany the waiver request.

      (2) When the waiver request is made during the ETA Grant Officer resolution process, the request must be made during the informal resolution period described in § 667.510(c).

      (c) A waiver of the recipient's liability shall be considered by the Grant Officer only when:

      (1) The misexpenditure of WIA funds occurred at a subrecipient's level;

      (2) The misexpenditure was not due to willful disregard of the requirements of title I of the Act, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration, or did not constitute fraud;

      (3) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipients; and

      (i) The recipient/subrecipients discovered, investigated, reported, and cooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and

      (ii) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented that further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile;

      (4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows the misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process has been exhausted, and a debt has been established; and

      (5) The recipient requests such a waiver and provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied with the requirements of section 184(d)(2) of the Act, and this section.

      (d) The recipient will not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by section 184(d) of the Act unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipients, would be inappropriate or would prove futile.

      § 667.730   What is the procedure to handle a recipient's request for advance approval of contemplated corrective actions?

#### § § 667.730

      (a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant Officer for contemplated corrective actions, including debt collection actions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The recipient's request must include a description and an assessment of all actions taken by the subrecipients to collect the misspent funds.

      (b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain collection actions against a subrecipient when:

      (1) The subrecipient meets the criteria set forth in section 184(d)(2) of the Act;

      (2) The misexpenditure of funds:

      (i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received WIA funds from that subrecipient;

      (ii) Was not a violation of section 184(d)(1) of the Act, and did not constitute fraud; or

      (iii) If fraud did exist,

      (A) It was perpetrated against the subrecipient; and:

      (B) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and cooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and

      (C) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented that further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile;

      (3) A final determination which disallows the misexpenditure and establishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate level;

      (5) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the recipient would be either inappropriate or futile.

      § 667.740   What procedure must be used for administering the offset/deduction provisions at section 184(c) of the Act?

#### § § 667.740

      (a)(1) For recipient level misexpenditures, we may determine that a debt, or a portion thereof, may be offset against amounts that are allotted to the recipient. Recipients must submit a written request for an offset to the Grant Officer. Generally, we will apply the offset against amounts that are available at the recipient level for administrative costs.

      (2) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the misexpenditures were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure.

      (b) For subrecipient level misexpenditures that were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure, if we have required the State to repay such amount the State may deduct an amount equal to the misexpenditure from its subsequent year's allocations to the local area from funds available for the administrative costs of the local programs involved.

      (c) If offset is granted, the debt will not be fully satisfied until the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to the State by the amount of the misexpenditure.

      (d) A State may not make a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section until the State has taken appropriate corrective action to ensure full compliance within the local area with regard to appropriate expenditure of WIA funds.

    Subpart H—Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review

      (a) An applicant for financial assistance under title I of WIA which is dissatisfied because we have issued a determination not to award financial assistance, in whole or in part, to such applicant; or a recipient, subrecipient, or a vendor against which the Grant Officer has directly imposed a sanction or corrective action, including a sanction against a State under 20 CFR part 666, may appeal to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) within 21 days of receipt of the final determination.

      (b) Failure to request a hearing within 21 days of receipt of the final determination constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.

      (c) A request for a hearing under this subpart must state specifically those issues in the final determination upon which review is requested. Those provisions of the final determination not specified for review, or the entire final determination when no hearing has been requested within the 21 days, are considered resolved and not subject to further review. Only alleged violations of the Act, its regulations, grant or other agreement under the Act fairly raised in the determination, and the request for hearing are subject to review.

      (d) A request for a hearing must be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Department of Labor, in accordance with 29 CFR part 18, with one copy to the Departmental official who issued the determination.

      (e) The procedures in this subpart apply in the case of a complainant who has not had a dispute adjudicated under the alternative dispute resolution process set forth in § 667.840 within the 60 days, except that the request for hearing before the OALJ must be filed within 15 days of the conclusion of the 60-day period provided in § 667.840.

      § 667.810   What rules of procedure apply to hearings conducted under this subpart?

#### § § 667.810

      (a)  The rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the OALJ at subpart A of 29 CFR part 18, govern the conduct of hearings under this subpart. However, a request for hearing under this subpart is not considered a complaint to which the filing of an answer by DOL or a DOL agency or official is required. Technical rules of evidence will not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part. However, rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to cross-examination will apply.

      (b)  In all cases, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) should encourage the use of prehearing procedures to simplify and clarify facts and issues.

      (c)  Subpoenas necessary to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents or other items at hearings must be obtained from the ALJ and must be issued under the authority contained in section 183(c) of the Act, incorporating 15 U.S.C. 49.

      (d)  The ALJ must not permit the introduction at the hearing of any documentation if it has not been made available for review by the other parties to the proceeding either at the time ordered for any prehearing conference, or, in the absence of such an order, at least 3 weeks prior to the hearing date.

      (e)  The Grant Officer has the burden of production to support her or his decision. To this end, the Grant Officer prepares and files an administrative file in support of the decision which must be made part of the record. Thereafter, the party or parties seeking to overturn the Grant Officer's decision has the burden of persuasion.

      § 667.820   What authority does the Administrative Law Judge have in ordering relief as an outcome of an administrative hearing?

#### § § 667.820

      In ordering relief, the ALJ has the full authority of the Secretary under the Act.

      § 667.825   What special rules apply to reviews of NFJP and WIA INA grant selections?

#### § § 667.825

      (a) An applicant whose application for funding as a WIA INA grantee under 20 CFR part 668 or as an NFJP grantee under 20 CFR part 669 is denied in whole or in part may request an administrative review under § 667.800(a) with to determine whether there is a basis in the record to support the decision. This appeal will not in any way interfere with the designation and funding of another organization to serve the area in question during the appeal period. The available remedy in such an appeal is the right to be designated in the future as the WIA INA or NFJP grantee for the remainder of the current grant cycle. Neither retroactive nor immediately effective selection status may be awarded as relief in a non-selection appeal under this section.

      (b) If the ALJ rules that the organization should have been selected and the organization continues to meet the requirements of 20 CFR part 668 or part 669, we will select and fund the organization within 90 days of the ALJ's decision unless the end of the 90-day period is within six (6) months of the end of the funding period. An applicant so selected is not entitled to the full grant amount, but will only receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been expended by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and its subsequent closeout.

      (c) Any organization selected and/or funded as a WIA INA or NFJP grantee is subject to being removed as grantee in the event an ALJ decision so orders. The Grant Officer provides instructions on transition and close-out to a grantee which is removed. All parties must agree to the provisions of this paragraph as a condition for WIA INA or NFJP funding.

      (d) A successful appellant which has not been awarded relief because of the application of paragraph (b) of this section is eligible to compete for funds in the immediately subsequent two-year grant cycle. In such a situation, we will not issue a waiver of competition and for the area and will select a grantee through the normal competitive process.

      § 667.830   When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a decision?

#### § § 667.830

      (a) The ALJ should render a written decision not later than 90 days after the closing of the record.

      (b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 01-2020), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken, in accordance with 29 CFR part 26. Any exception not specifically urged is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review must be sent to the opposing party at that time. Thereafter, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, notifies the parties that the case has been accepted for review. In any case accepted by the ARB, a decision must be issued by the ARB within 180 days of acceptance. If a decision is not so issued, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.

#### § § 667.840

      (a) Parties to a complaint which has been filed according to the requirements of § 667.800 may choose to waive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts and render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter for informal review.

      (b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ will automatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a decision has not been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as a final decision of an Administrative Law Judge under section 186(b) of the Act.

      (b) The court has jurisdiction to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the Secretary, in whole or in part.

      (c) No objection to the Secretary's order may be considered by the court unless the objection was specifically urged, in a timely manner, before the Secretary. The review is limited to questions of law, and the findings of fact of the Secretary are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

      (d) The judgment of the court is final, subject to certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court.

      § 667.860   Are there other remedies available outside of the Act?

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 49435, Aug. 11, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purposes and Policies

      § 668.100   What is the purpose of the programs established to serve Native American peoples (INA programs) under section 166 of the Workforce Investment Act?

#### § § 668.100

      (a) The purpose of WIA INA programs is to support comprehensive employment and training activities for Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian individuals in order to:

      (1) Develop more fully their academic, occupational, and literacy skills;

      (2) Make them more competitive in the workforce;

      (3) Promote the economic and social development of Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities according to the goals and values of such communities; and

      (4) Help them achieve personal and economic self-sufficiency.

      (b) The principal means of accomplishing these purposes is to enable tribes and Native American organizations to provide employment and training services to Native American peoples and their communities. Services should be provided in a culturally appropriate manner, consistent with the principles of Indian self-determination. (WIA sec. 166(a)(1).)

      § 668.120   How must INA programs be administered?

#### § § 668.120

      (a) We will administer INA programs to maximize the Federal commitment to support the growth and development of Native American people and communities as determined by representatives of such communities.

      (b) In administering these programs, we will observe the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. section 450a, as well as the Department of Labor's “American Indian and Alaska Native Policy,” dated July 29, 1998.

      (c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the trust responsibilities of the Federal Government to Native American bands, tribes, or groups in any way.

      (d) We will administer INA programs through a single organizational unit and consistent with the requirements in section 166(h) of the Act. We have designated the Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) as this single organizational unit required by WIA section 166(h)(1).

      (e) We will establish and maintain administrative procedures for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of Native American employment and training programs authorized under this Act. We will utilize staff who have a particular competence in this field to administer these programs. (WIA sec. 166(h).)

      § 668.130   What obligation do we have to consult with the INA grantee community in developing rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for INA programs?

#### § § 668.130

      We will consult with the Native American grantee community as a full partner in developing policies for the INA programs. We will actively seek and consider the views of all INA grantees, and will discuss options with the grantee community prior to establishing policies and program regulations. The primary consultation vehicle is the Native American Employment and Training Council. (WIA sec. 166(h)(2).)

      § 668.140   What WIA regulations apply to the INA program?

#### § § 668.140

      (a) The regulations found in this subpart.

      (b) The general administrative requirements found in 20 CFR part 667, including the regulations concerning Complaints, Investigations and Hearings found at 20 CFR part 667, subpart E through subpart H.

      (c) The Department's regulations codifying the common rules implementing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars which generally apply to Federal programs carried out by Indian tribal governments and nonprofit organizations, at 29 CFR parts 95, 96, 97, and 99 as applicable.

      (d) The Department's regulations at 29 CFR part 37, which implement the nondiscrimination provisions of WIA section 188, apply to recipients of financial assistance under WIA section 166.

      § 668.150   What definitions apply to terms used in the regulations in this part?

#### § § 668.150

      In addition to the definitions found in WIA sections 101 and 166 and 20 CFR 660.300, the following definitions apply:

      means the Division of Indian and Native American Programs within the Employment and Training Administration of the Department.

      means a body of representatives who are duly elected, appointed by duly elected officials, or selected according to traditional tribal means. A governing body must have the authority to provide services to and to enter into grants on behalf of the organization that selected or designated it.

      means a Department of Labor official authorized to obligate Federal funds. Indian or Native American (INA)  means an entity which is formally designated under subpart B of this part to operate an INA program and which has a grant agreement under § 668.292.

      means the Native Employment Works Program, the tribal work program authorized under section 412(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (Public Law 104-193).

      means an individual who is working part time but desires full time employment, or who is working in employment not commensurate with the individual's demonstrated level of educational and/or skill achievement.

    Subpart B—Service Delivery Systems Applicable to Section 166 Programs

      § 668.200   What are the requirements for designation as an “Indian or Native American (INA) grantee”?

#### § § 668.200

      (a) To be designated as an INA grantee, an entity must have:

      (1) A legal status as a government or as an agency of a government, private non-profit corporation, or a consortium which contains at least one of these entities;

      (2) The ability to administer INA program funds, as defined at § 668.220; and

      (3) A new (non-incumbent) entity must have a population within the designated geographic service area which would provide funding under the funding formula found at § 668.296(b) in the amount of at least $100,000, including any amounts received for supplemental youth services under the funding formula at § 668.440(a). Incumbent grantees which do not meet this dollar threshold for Program Year (PY) 2000 and beyond will be grandfathered in. We will make an exception for grantees wishing to participate in the demonstration program under Public Law 102-477 if all resources to be consolidated under the Public Law 102-477 plan total at least $100,000, with at least $20,000 derived from section 166 funds as determined by the most recent Census data. Exceptions to this $20,000 limit may be made for those entities which are close to the limit and which have demonstrated the capacity to administer Federal funds and operate a successful employment and training program.

      (b) To be designated as a Native American grantee, a consortium or its members must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must:

      (1) Be in close proximity to one another, but they may operate in more than one State;

      (2) Have an administrative unit legally authorized to run the program and to commit the other members to contracts, grants, and other legally-binding agreements; and

      (3) Be jointly and individually responsible for the actions and obligations of the consortium, including debts.

      (c) Entities potentially eligible for designation under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section are:

      (1) Federally-recognized Indian tribes;

      (2) Tribal organizations, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b;

      (3) Alaska Native-controlled organizations representing regional or village areas, as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act;

      (4) Native Hawaiian-controlled entities;

      (5) Native American-controlled organizations serving Indians; and

      (6) Consortia of eligible entities which individually meets the legal requirements for a consortium described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (d) Under WIA section 166(d)(2)(B), individuals who were eligible to participate under section 401 of JTPA on August 6, 1998, remain eligible to participate under section 166 of WIA. State-recognized tribal organizations serving such individuals are considered to be “Native American controlled” for WIA section 166 purposes.

      § 668.210   What priority for designation is given to eligible organizations?

#### § § 668.210

      (a) Federally-recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or consortia that include a tribe or entity will have the highest priority for designation. To be designated, the organizations must meet the requirements in this subpart. These organizations will be designated for those geographic areas and/or populations over which they have legal jurisdiction. (WIA sec. 166(c)(1).)

      (b) If we decide not to designate Indian tribes or Alaska Native entities to serve their service areas, we will enter into arrangements to provide services with entities which the tribes or Alaska Native entities involved approve.

      (c) In geographic areas not served by Indian tribes or Alaska Native entities, entities with a Native American-controlled governing body and which are representative of the Native American community or communities involved will have priority for designation.

      § 668.220   What is meant by the “ability to administer funds” for designation purposes?

#### § § 668.220

      An organization has the “ability to administer funds” if it:

      (a) Is in compliance with Departmental debt management procedures, if applicable;

      (b) Has not been found guilty of fraud or criminal activity which would affect the entity's ability to safeguard Federal funds or deliver program services;

      (c) Can demonstrate that it has or can acquire the necessary program and financial management personnel to safeguard Federal funds and effectively deliver program services; and

      (d) Can demonstrate that it has successfully carried out, or has the capacity to successfully carry out activities that will strengthen the ability of the individuals served to obtain or retain unsubsidized employment.

      § 668.230   How will we determine an entity's “ability to administer funds”?

#### § § 668.230

      (a) Before determining which entity to designate for a particular service area, we will conduct a review of the entity's ability to administer funds.

      (b) The review for an entity that has served as a grantee in either of the two designation periods before the one under consideration, also will consider the extent of compliance with the WIA regulations. Evidence of the ability to administer funds may be established by a satisfactory Federal audit record. It may also be established by a recent record showing substantial compliance with Federal record keeping, reporting, program performance standards, or similar standards imposed on grantees by this or other public sector supported programs.

      (c) For other entities, the review includes the experience of the entity's management in administering funds for services to Native American people. This review also includes an assessment of the relationship between the entity and the Native American community or communities to be served.

      § 668.240   What is the process for applying for designation as an INA grantee?

#### § § 668.240

      (a) Every entity seeking designation must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) which complies with the requirements of the Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA). An SGA will be issued every two years, covering all areas except for those for which competition is waived for the incumbent grantee under WIA section 166(c)(2).

      (b) NOI's must be submitted to the Chief of DINAP, bearing a U.S. Postal Service postmark indicating its submission no later than October 1st of the year which precedes the first year of a new designation cycle (unless the SGA provides a later date). For NOI's received after October 1, only a timely official U.S. Postal Service postmark is acceptable as proof of timely submission. Dates indicating submission by private express delivery services or metered mail are unacceptable as proof of the timely submission of designation documents.

      (c) NOI's must include the following:

      (1) Documentation of the legal status of the entity, as described in § 668.200(a)(1);

      (2) A Standard Form (SF) 424b;

      (3) The assurances required by 29 CFR 37.20;

      (4) A specific description, by State, county, reservation or similar area, or service population, of the geographic area for which the entity requests designation;

      (5) A brief summary of the employment and training or human resource development programs serving Native Americans that the entity currently operates or has operated within the previous two-year period;

      (6) A description of the planning process used by the entity, including the involvement of the governing body and local employers;

      (7) Evidence to establish an entity's ability to administer funds under §§ 668.220 through 668.230.

      § 668.250   What happens if two or more entities apply for the same area?

#### § § 668.250

      (a) Every two years, unless there has been a waiver of competition for the area, we issue a Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA) seeking applicants for INA program grants.

      (b) If two or more entities apply for grants for the same service area, or for overlapping service areas, and a waiver of competition under WIA section 166(c)(2) is not granted to the incumbent grantee, the following additional procedures apply:

      (1) The Grant Officer will follow the regulations for priority designation at § 668.210.

      (2) If no applicant is entitled to priority designation, DINAP will inform each entity which submitted a NOI, including the incumbent grantee, in writing, of all the competing Notices of Intent no later than November 15 of the year the NOI's are received.

      (3) Each entity will have an opportunity to describe its service plan, and may submit additional information addressing the requirements of § 668.240(c) or such other information as the applicant determines is appropriate. Revised Notices must be received or contain an official U.S. Postal Service postmark, no later than January 5th (unless a later date is provided in DINAP's information notice).

      (4) The Grant Officer selects the entity that demonstrates the ability to produce the best outcomes for its customers.

      § 668.260   How are INA grantees designated?

#### § § 668.260

      (a) On March 1 of each designation year, we designate or conditionally designate Native American grantees for the coming two program years. The Grant Officer informs, in writing, each entity which submitted a Notice of Intent that the entity has been:

      (1) Designated;

      (2) Conditionally designated;

      (3) Designated for only a portion of its requested area or population; or

      (4) Denied designation.

      (b) Designated Native American entities must ensure and provide evidence to DOL that a system is in place to afford all members of the eligible population within their service area an equitable opportunity to receive employment and training activities and services.

      § 668.270   What appeal rights are available to entities that are denied designation?

#### § § 668.270

      Any entity that is denied designation in whole or in part for the area or population that it requested may appeal the denial to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges using the procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 or the alternative dispute resolution procedures at 20 CFR 667.840. The Grant Officer will provide an entity whose request for designation was denied, in whole or in part, with a copy of the appeal procedures.

      § 668.280   Are there any other ways in which an entity may be designated as an INA grantee?

#### § § 668.280

      Yes, for an area which would otherwise go unserved. The Grant Officer may designate an entity, which has not submitted an NOI, but which meets the qualifications for designation, to serve the particular geographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP will seek the views of Native American leaders in the area involved about the decision to designate the entity to serve that community. DINAP will inform the Grant Officer of their views. The Grant Officer will accommodate their views to the extent possible.

      § 668.290   Can an INA grantee's designation be terminated?

#### § § 668.290

      (a) Yes, the Grant Officer can terminate a grantee's designation for cause, or the Secretary or another DOL official confirmed by the Senate can terminate a grantee's designation in emergency circumstances where termination is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program. (WIA sec. 184(e).)

      (b) The Grant Officer may terminate a grantee's designation for cause only if there is a substantial or persistent violation of the requirements in the Act or the WIA regulations. The grantee must be provided with written notice 60 days before termination, stating the specific reasons why termination is proposed. The appeal procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 apply.

      (c) The Secretary must give a grantee terminated in emergency circumstances prompt notice of the termination and an opportunity for a hearing within 30 days of the termination.

      § 668.292   How does a designated entity become an INA grantee?

#### § § 668.292

      A designated entity becomes a grantee on the effective date of an executed grant agreement, signed by the authorized official of the grantee organization and the Grant Officer. The grant agreement includes a set of certifications and assurances that the grantee will comply with the terms of the Act, the WIA regulations, and other appropriate requirements. Funds are released to the grantee upon approval of the required planning documents, as described in §§ 668.710 through 668.740.

      § 668.294   Do we have to designate an INA grantee for every part of the country?

#### § § 668.294

      No, beginning with the PY 2000 grant awards, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for designation in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, we will not allocate funds for that service area. The funds allocated to that area will be distributed to the remaining INA grantees, or used for other program purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for technical assistance and training are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 668.296(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent designation cycle, when and if a current grantee or other eligible entity applies for and is designated to serve that area.

      § 668.296   How are WIA funds allocated to INA grantees?

#### § § 668.296

      (a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this section and funds used for program purposes under § 668.294, all funds available for WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive workforce investment services program at the beginning of a Program Year will be allocated to Native American grantees for their designated geographic service areas.

      (b) Each INA grantee will receive the sum of the funds calculated under the following formula:

      (1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of unemployed Native American persons in the grantee's designated INA service area(s) compared to all such persons in all such areas in the United States.

      (2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of Native American persons in poverty in the grantee's designated INA service area(s) as compared to all such persons in all such areas in the United States.

      (3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas is provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

      (c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section, based upon criteria to be described in the SGA, we may utilize a hold harmless factor to reduce the disruption in grantee services which would otherwise result from changes in funding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.

      (d) We may reallocate funds from one INA grantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve its area for any reason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal (political) strife, or lack of ability or interest. Funds may also be reallocated if a grantee has carry-in excess of 20 percent of the total funds available to it. Carry-in amounts greater than 20 percent but less than 25 percent of total funds available may be allowed under an approved waiver issued by DINAP.

      (e) We may reserve up to one percent (1 percent) of the funds appropriated under WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for any Program Year for TAT purposes. Technical assistance will be provided in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council.

      § 668.360   What is the role of INA grantees in the One-Stop system?

#### § § 668.360

      (a) In those local workforce investment areas where an INA grantee conducts field operations or provides substantial services, the INA grantee is a required partner in the local One-Stop delivery system and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR part 662. Consistent with those provisions, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the INA grantee and the Local Board over the operation of the One-Stop Center(s) in the Local Board's workforce investment area also must be executed. Where the Local Board is an alternative entity under 20 CFR 661.330, the INA grantee must negotiate with the alternative entity on the terms of its MOU and the scope of its on-going role in the local workforce investment system, as specified in 20 CFR 661.310(b)(2). In local areas with a large concentration of potentially eligible INA participants, which are in an INA grantee's service area but in which the grantee does not conduct operations or provide substantial services, the INA grantee should encourage such individuals to participate in the One-Stop system in that area in order to receive WIA services.

      (b) At a minimum, the MOU must contain provisions related to:

      (1) The services to be provided through the One-Stop Service System;

      (2) The methods for referral of individuals between the One-Stop operator and the INA grantee which take into account the services provided by the INA grantee and the other One-Stop partners;

      (3) The exchange of information on the services available and accessible through the One-Stop system and the INA program;

      (4) As necessary to provide referrals and case management services, the exchange of information on Native American participants in the One-Stop system and the INA program;

      (5) Arrangements for the funding of services provided by the One-Stop(s), consistent with the requirements at 20 CFR 662.280 that no expenditures may be made with INA program funds for individuals who are not eligible or for services not authorized under this part.

      (c) The INA grantee's Two Year Plan must describe the efforts the grantee has made to negotiate MOU's consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, for each planning cycle during which Local Boards are operating under the terms of WIA.

      § 668.370   What policies govern payments to participants, including wages, training allowances or stipends, or direct payments for supportive services?

#### § § 668.370

      (a) INA grantees may pay training allowances or stipends to participants for their successful participation in and completion of education or training services (except such allowance may not be provided to participants in OJT). Allowances or stipends may not exceed the Federal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher.

      (b) INA grantees may not pay a participant in a training activity when the person fails to participate without good cause.

      (c) If a participant in a WIA-funded activity, including participants in OJT, is involved in an employer-employee relationship, that participant must be paid wages and fringe benefits at the same rates as trainees or employees who have similar training, experience and skills and which are not less than the higher of the applicable Federal, State or local minimum wage. (WIA sec. 181(a)(1).)

      (d) In accordance with the policy described in the two-year plan, INA grantees may pay incentive bonuses to participants who meet or exceed individual employability or training goals established in writing in the individual employment plan.

      (e) INA grantees must comply with other restrictions listed in WIA sections 181 through 199, which apply to all programs funded under title I of WIA.

      (f) INA grantees must comply with the provisions on labor standards in WIA section 181(b).

      § 668.380   What will we do to strengthen the capacity of INA grantees to deliver effective services?

#### § § 668.380

      We will provide appropriate TAT, as necessary, to INA grantees. This TAT will assist INA grantees to improve program performance and enhance services to the target population(s), as resources permit. (WIA sec. 166(h)(5).)

    Subpart D—Supplemental Youth Services

      § 668.400   What is the purpose of the supplemental youth services program?

#### § § 668.400

      The purpose of this program is to provide supplemental employment and training and related services to Native American youth on or near Indian reservations, or in Oklahoma, Alaska, and Hawaii. (WIA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(ii).)

      § 668.410   What entities are eligible to receive supplemental youth services funding?

#### § § 668.410

      Eligible recipients for supplemental youth services funding are limited to those tribal, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Oklahoma tribal grantees funded under WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(i), or other grantees serving those areas and/or populations specified in § 668.400, that received funding under title II-B of the Job Training Partnership Act, or that are designated to serve an eligible area as specified in WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(ii).

      § 668.420   What are the planning requirements for receiving supplemental youth services funding?

#### § § 668.420

      Beginning with PY 2000, eligible INA grantees must describe the supplemental youth services which they intend to provide in their Two Year Plan (described more fully in §§ 668.710 and 668.720). This Plan includes the target population the grantee intends to serve, for example, drop-outs, juvenile offenders, and/or college students. It also includes the performance measures/standards to be utilized to measure program progress.

      § 668.430   What individuals are eligible to receive supplemental youth services?

#### § § 668.430

      (a) Participants in supplemental youth services activities must be Native Americans, as determined by the INA grantee according to § 668.300(a), and must meet the definition of Eligible Youth, as defined in WIA section 101(13).

      (b) Youth participants must be low-income individuals, except that not more than five percent (5%) who do not meet the minimum income criteria, may be considered eligible youth if they meet one or more of the following categories:

      (1) School dropouts;

      (2) Basic skills deficient as defined in WIA section 101(4);

      (3) Have educational attainment that is one or more grade levels below the grade level appropriate to their age group;

      § 668.440   How is funding for supplemental youth services determined?

#### § § 668.440

      (a) Beginning with PY 2000, supplemental youth funding will be allocated to eligible INA grantees on the basis of the relative number of Native American youth between the ages of 14 and 21, inclusive, in the grantee's designated INA service area as compared to the number of Native American youth in other eligible INA service areas. We reserve the right to redetermine this youth funding stream in future program years, in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council, as program experience warrants and as appropriate data become available.

      (b) The data used to implement this formula is provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

      (c) The hold harmless factor described in § 668.296(c) also applies to supplemental youth services funding. This factor also will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.

      (d) The reallocation provisions of § 668.296(d) also apply to supplemental youth services funding.

      (e) Any supplemental youth services funds not allotted to a grantee or refused by a grantee may be used for the purposes outlined in § 668.296(e), as described in § 668.294. Any such funds are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 668.296(e).

      § 668.450   How will supplemental youth services be provided?

#### § § 668.450

      (a) INA grantees may offer supplemental services to youth throughout the school year, during the summer vacation, and/or during other breaks during the school year at their discretion;

      (b) We encourage INA grantees to work with Local Educational Agencies to provide academic credit for youth activities whenever possible;

      (c) INA grantees may provide participating youth with the activities listed in 20 CFR 668.340(e).

      § 668.460   Are there performance measures and standards applicable to the supplemental youth services program?

#### § § 668.460

      Yes, WIA section 166(e)(5) requires that the program plan contain a description of the performance measures to be used to assess the performance of grantees in carrying out the activities assisted under this section. We will develop specific indicators of performance and levels of performance for supplemental youth services activities in partnership with the Native American Employment and Training Council, and will transmit them to INA grantees as an administrative issuance.

    Subpart E—Services to Communities

      § 668.500   What services may INA grantees provide to or for employers under section 166?

#### § § 668.500

      § 668.520   Must INA grantees give preference to Indian/Native American entities in the selection of contractors or service providers?

#### § § 668.520

      Yes, INA grantees must give as much preference as possible to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economic enterprises, as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452), when awarding any contract or subgrant.

      § 668.530   What rules govern the issuance of contracts and/or subgrants?

#### § § 668.530

      In general, INA grantees must follow the rules of OMB Circulars A-102 (for tribes) or A-110 (for private non-profits) when awarding contracts and/or subgrants under WIA section 166. The common rules implementing those circulars are codified for DOL-funded programs at 29 CFR part 97 (A-102) or 29 CFR part 95 (A-110), and covered in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR 667.200. These rules do not apply to OJT contract awards.

    Subpart F—Accountability for Services and Expenditures

      § 668.600   To whom is the INA grantee accountable for the provision of services and the expenditure of INA funds?

#### § § 668.600

      (a) The INA grantee is responsible to the Native American community to be served by INA funds.

      (b) The INA grantee is also responsible to the Department of Labor, which is charged by law with ensuring that all WIA funds are expended:

      (1) According to applicable laws and regulations;

      (2) For the benefit of the identified Native American client group; and

      (3) For the purposes approved in the grantee's plan and signed grant document.

      § 668.610   How is this accountability documented and fulfilled?

#### § § 668.610

      (a) Each INA grantee must establish its own internal policies and procedures to ensure accountability to the INA grantee's governing body, as the representative of the Native American community(ies) served by the INA program. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must provide a system for governing body review and oversight of program plans and measures and standards for program performance.

      (b) Accountability to the Department is accomplished in part through on-site program reviews (monitoring), which strengthen the INA grantee's capability to deliver effective services and protect the integrity of Federal funds.

      (c) In addition to audit information, as described at § 668.850 and program reviews, accountability to the Department is documented and fulfilled by the submission of reports. For the purposes of report submission, a postmark or date indicating receipt by a private express delivery service is acceptable proof of timely submission. These report requirements are as follows:

      (1) Each INA grantee must submit an annual report on program participants and activities. This report must be received no later than 90 days after the end of the Program Year, and may be combined with the report on program expenditures. The reporting format is developed by DINAP, in consultation with the Native American Advisory Council, and published in the

      (2) Each INA grantee must submit an annual report on program expenditures. This report must be received no later than 90 days after the end of the Program Year, and may be combined with the report on program participants and activities.

      (3) INA grantees are encouraged, but not required, to submit a descriptive narrative with their annual reports describing the barriers to successful plan implementation they have encountered. This narrative should also discuss program successes and other notable occurrences that effected the INA grantee's overall performance that year.

      (4) Each INA grantee may be required to submit interim reports on program participants and activities and/or program expenditures during the Program Year. Interim reports must be received no later than 45 days after the end of the reporting period.

      § 668.620   What performance measures are in place for the INA program?

#### § § 668.620

      Indicators of performance measures and levels of performance in use for INA program will be those indicators and standards proposed in individual grantee plans and approved by us, in accordance with guidelines we will develop in consultation with INA grantees under WIA section 166(h)(2)(A).

      § 668.630   What are the requirements for preventing fraud and abuse under section 166?

#### § § 668.630

      (a) Each INA grantee must implement program and financial management procedures to prevent fraud and abuse. Such procedures must include a process which enables the grantee to take action against contractors or subgrantees to prevent any misuse of funds. (WIA sec. 184.)

      (b) Each INA grantee must have rules to prevent conflict of interest by its governing body. These conflict of interest rules must include a rule prohibiting any member of any governing body or council associated with the INA grantee from voting on any matter which would provide a direct financial benefit to that member, or to a member of his or her immediate family, in accordance with 20 CFR 667.200(a)(4) and 29 CFR 97.36(b) or 29 CFR 95.42.

      (c) Officers or agents of the INA grantee must not solicit or personally accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from any actual or potential contractor, subgrantee, vendor or participant. This rule must also apply to officers or agents of the grantee's contractors and/or subgrantees. This prohibition does not apply to:

      (1) Any rebate, discount or similar incentive provided by a vendor to its customers as a regular feature of its business;

      (2) Items of nominal monetary value distributed consistent with the cultural practices of the Native American community served by the grantee.

      (d) No person who selects program participants or authorizes the services provided to them may select or authorize services to any participant who is such a person's husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, or daughter unless:

      (1)(i) The participant involved is a low income individual; or

      (ii) The community in which the participant resides has a population of less than 1,000 Native American people; and

      (2) The INA grantee has adopted and implemented the policy described in the Two Year Plan to prevent favoritism on behalf of such relatives.

      (e) INA grantees are subject to the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 53 relating to kickbacks.

      (h) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 665 and 666 prohibiting embezzlement apply to programs under WIA.

      (i) Recipients of financial assistance under WIA section 168 are prohibited from discriminatory practices as outlined at WIA section 188, and the regulations implementing WIA section 188, at 29 CFR part 37. However, this does not affect the legal requirement that all INA participants be Native American. Also, INA grantees are not obligated to serve populations other than those for which they were designated.

      § 668.640   What grievance systems must a section 166 program provide?

#### § § 668.640

      INA grantees must establish grievance procedures consistent with the requirements of WIA section 181(c) and 20 CFR 667.600.

      § 668.650   Can INA grantees exclude segments of the eligible population?

#### § § 668.650

      (a) No, INA grantees cannot exclude segments of the eligible population. INA grantees must document in their Two Year Plan that a system is in place to afford all members of the eligible population within the service area for which the grantee was designated an equitable opportunity to receive WIA services and activities.

      (b) Nothing in this section restricts the ability of INA grantees to target subgroups of the eligible population (for example, the disabled, substance abusers, TANF recipients, or similar categories), as outlined in an approved Two Year Plan. However, it is unlawful to target services to subgroups on grounds prohibited by WIA section 188 and 29 CFR part 37, including tribal affilitation (which is considered national origin). Outreach efforts, on the other hand, may be targeted to any subgroups.

    Subpart G—Section 166 Planning/Funding Process

      § 668.700   What process must an INA grantee use to plan its employment and training services?

#### § § 668.700

      (a) An INA grantee may utilize the planning procedures it uses to plan other activities and services.

      (b) However, in the process of preparing its Two Year Plan for Native American WIA services, the INA grantee must consult with:

      (1) Customers or prospective customers of such services;

      (2) Prospective employers of program participants or their representatives;

      (3) Service providers, including local educational agencies, which can provide services which support or are complementary to the grantee's own services; and

      (2) The method the INA grantee will use to target its services to specific segments of its service population;

      (3) The array of services which the INA grantee intends to make available;

      (4) The system the INA grantee will use to be accountable for the results of its program services. Such results must be judged in terms of the outcomes for individual participants and/or the benefits the program provides to the Native American community(ies) which the INA grantee serves. Plans must include the performance information required by § 668.620;

      (5) The ways in which the INA grantee will seek to integrate or coordinate and ensure nonduplication of its employment and training services with:

      (i) The One-Stop delivery system in its local workforce investment area, including a description of any MOU's which affect the grantee's participation;

      (ii) Other services provided by Local Workforce Investment Boards;

      (iii) Other program operators;

      (iv) Other services available within the grantee organization; and

      § 668.730   When must these plans be submitted?

#### § § 668.730

      (a) The two-year plans are due at a date specified by DINAP in the year in which the two-year designation cycle begins. We will announce exact submission dates in the biennial planning instructions.

      (b) Plans from INA grantees who are eligible for supplemental youth services funds must include their supplemental youth plans as part of their regular Two Year Plan.

      (c) INA grantees must submit modifications for the second year reflecting exact funding amounts, after the individual allotments have been determined. We will announce the time for their submission, which will be no later than June 1 prior to the beginning of the second year of the designation cycle.

      § 668.740   How will we review and approve such plans?

#### § § 668.740

      (a) We will approve a grantee's planning documents before the date on which funds for the program become available unless:

      (2) The services which the INA grantee proposes are not permitted under WIA or applicable regulations.

      (b) We may approve a portion of the plan, and disapprove other portions. The grantee also has the right to appeal the decision to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 or 667.840. While the INA grantee exercises its right to appeal, the grantee must implement the approved portions of the plan.

      (c) If we disapprove all or part of an INA grantee's plan, and that disapproval is sustained in the appeal process, the INA grantee will be given the opportunity to amend its plan so that it can be approved.

      (d) If an INA grantee's plan is amended but is still disapproved, the grantee will have the right to appeal the decision to the Offices of the Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 or 667.840.

      § 668.750   Under what circumstances can we or the INA grantee modify the terms of the grantee's plan(s)?

#### § § 668.750

      (a) We may unilaterally modify the INA grantee's plan to add funds or, if required by Congressional action, to reduce the amount of funds available for expenditure.

      (b) The INA grantee may request approval to modify its plan to add, expand, delete, or diminish any service allowable under the regulations in this part. The INA grantee may modify its plan without our approval, unless the modification reduces the total number of participants to be served annually under the grantee's program by a number which exceeds 25 percent of the participants previously proposed to be served, or by 25 participants, whichever is larger.

      (c) We will act upon any modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the proposed modification. In the event that further clarification or modification is required, we may extend the thirty (30) day time frame to conclude appropriate negotiations.

(WIA sec. 166(f) and (h)(6).)

      § 668.940   What is the role of the Native American Employment and Training Council?

#### § § 668.940

      The Native American Employment and Training Council is a body composed of representatives of the grantee community which advises the Secretary on all aspects of Native American employment and training program implementation. WIA section 166(h)(4) continues the Council essentially as it is currently constituted, with the exception that all the Council members no longer have to be Native American. However, the nature of the consultative process remains essentially unchanged. We continue to support the Council.

    (1) The State receives a notification of a mass layoff or a closure as a result of a WARN notice, a general announcement or some other means determined by the Governor to be sufficient to respond;

    (2) Rapid response assistance has been initiated; and

    (3) A determination has been made, in collaboration with the applicable Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s), that State and local formula dislocated worker funds are inadequate to provide the level of services needed by the workers being laid off.

    (b) An eligible entity may apply for a national emergency grant at any time during the year.

    (c) Applications for national emergency grants to respond to a declared emergency or natural disaster as described in § 671.110(e), cannot be considered until FEMA has declared that the affected area is eligible for disaster-related public assistance.

    § 671.140   What are the allowable activities and what dislocated workers may be served under national emergency grants?

#### § § 671.140

    (a) National emergency grants may provide adjustment assistance for eligible dislocated workers, described at WIA section 173(c)(2) or (d)(2).

    (b) Adjustment assistance includes the core, intensive, and training services authorized at WIA sections 134(d) and 173. The scope of services to be provided in a particular project are negotiated between the Department and the grantee, taking into account the needs of the target population covered by the grant. The scope of services may be changed through grant modifications, if necessary.

    (c) National emergency grants may provide for supportive services to help workers who require such assistance to participate in activities provided for in the grant. Needs-related payments, in support of other employment and training assistance, may be available for the purpose of enabling dislocated workers who are eligible for such payments to participate in programs of training services. Generally, the terms of a grant must be consistent with Local Board policies governing such financial assistance with formula funds (including the payment levels and duration of payments). However, the terms of the grant agreement may diverge from established Local Board policies, in the following instances:

    (1) If unemployed dislocated workers served by the project are not able to meet the 13 or 8 weeks enrollment in training requirement at WIA section 134(e)(3)(B) because of the lack of formula or emergency grant funds in the State or local area at the time of dislocation, such individuals may be eligible for needs-related payments if they are enrolled in training by the end of the 6th week following the date of the emergency grant award;

    (2) Trade-impacted workers who are not eligible for trade readjustment assistance under NAFTA-TAA may be eligible for needs-related payments under a national emergency grant if the worker is enrolled in training by the end of the 16th week following layoff; and

    (3) Under other circumstances as specified in the national emergency grant application guidelines.

    (d) A national emergency grant to respond to a declared emergency or natural disaster, as defined at § 671.110(e), may provide short-term disaster relief employment for:

    (1) Individuals who are temporarily or permanently laid off as a consequence of the disaster;

    (2) Dislocated workers; and

    (3) Long-term unemployed individuals.

    (e) Temporary employment assistance is authorized on disaster projects that provide food, clothing, shelter and other humanitarian assistance for disaster victims; and on projects that perform demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation and reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities and lands located within the disaster area. For such temporary jobs, each eligible worker is limited to no more than six months of employment for each single disaster. The amounts, duration and other limitations on wages will be negotiated for each grant.

    (f) Additional requirements that apply to national emergency grants, including natural disaster grants, are contained in the application instructions.

    § 671.150   How do statutory and workflex waivers apply to national emergency grants?

#### § § 671.150

    (a) State and Local Board grantees may request and we may approve the application of existing general statutory or regulatory waivers and workflex waivers to a National Emergency Grant award. The application for grant funds must describe any statutory waivers which the applicant wishes to apply to the project that the State and/or Local Board, as applicable, have been granted under its waiver plan, or that the State has approved for implementation in the applicable local area under workflex waivers. We will consider such requests as part of the overall application review and decision process.

    (b) If, during the operation of the project, the grantee wishes to apply a waiver not identified in the application, the grantee must request a modification which includes the provision to be waived, the operational barrier to be removed and the effect upon the outcome of the project.

    § 671.160   What rapid response activities are required before a national emergency grant application is submitted?

#### § § 671.160

    (a) Rapid response is a required Statewide activity under WIA section 134(a)(2)(A), to be carried out by the State or its designee in collaboration with the Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s). Under 20 CFR 665.310, rapid response encompasses, among other activities, an assessment of the general needs of the affected workers and the resources available to them.

    (b) In accordance with national emergency grant application guidelines published by the Department, each applicant must demonstrate that:

    (1) The rapid response activities described in 20 CFR 665.310 have been initiated and carried out, or are in the process of being carried out;

    (2) State and local funds, including those made available under section 132(b)(2)(B) of the Act, have been used to initiate appropriate services to the eligible workers;

    (3) There is a need for additional funds to effectively respond to the assistance needs of the workers and, in the case of declared emergencies and natural disasters, the community; and

    (4) The application has been developed by or in conjunction with the Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s) of the local area(s) in which the proposed project is to operate.

    § 671.170   What are the program and administrative requirements that apply to national emergency grants?

#### § § 671.170

    (a) In general, the program requirements and administrative standards set forth at 20 CFR parts 663 and 667 will apply.

    (b) Exceptions include:

    (1) Funds provided in response to a natural disaster may be used for temporary job creation in areas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, subject to the limitations of WIA section 173(d), this part and the application guidelines issued by the Department;

#### § § 672.100

      (a) YouthBuild is a workforce development program that provides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged and low-income youth between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom are secondary school drop outs and are either a member of a low-income family, a foster care youth, a youth offender, a youth with a disability, a child of an incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.

      (b) Program participants receive education services that may lead to either a high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED). Further, they receive occupational skills training and are encouraged to pursue a post- secondary education or additional training, including registered apprenticeship programs. The program is designed to create a skilled workforce either in the construction industry, through the rehabilitation and construction of housing for homeless individuals and families and low- income families, as well as public facilities, or in other high wage, high-demand jobs. The program also benefits the larger community because it provides more new and rehabilitated affordable housing.

      § 672.105   What are the purposes of the YouthBuild program?

#### § § 672.105

      (a) The overarching goal of the YouthBuild program is to provide disadvantaged and low-income youth the opportunity to obtain education and employment skills in local in-demand and high-demand jobs to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, the YouthBuild program has as goals:

      (1) To promote leadership skills development and community service activities. YouthBuild programs will foster the development of leadership skills and a commitment to community improvement among youth in low-income communities.

      (2) To enable youth to further their education and training. YouthBuild programs will provide counseling and assistance in obtaining post-secondary education and/or employment and training placements that allow youth to further their education and training.

      (3) To expand the supply of permanent affordable housing and reduce the rate of homelessness in communities with YouthBuild programs. The program seeks to increase the number of affordable housing units available and to decrease the number of homeless individuals and families in their communities.

      (b) Through these educational and occupational opportunities, to enable youth participants to provide a valuable contribution to their communities. The YouthBuild program will add skilled workers to the workforce by educating and training youth who might have otherwise succumbed to the negative influences within their environments.

      (a) All States submitting either a Unified or Combined State Plan under §§ 676.130 and 676.143 of this chapter, must propose expected levels of performance for each of the primary indicators of performance for the adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs authorized under WIOA title I; the AEFLA program authorized under WIOA title II; the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III; and the VR program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV.

      (1)  The six primary indicators of performance for the adult and dislocated worker programs, the AEFLA program, and the VR program are:

      (i) The percentage of participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the program;

      (ii) The percentage of participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit from the program;

      (iii) Median earnings of participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the program;

      (iv)(A) The percentage of those participants enrolled in an education or training program (excluding those in on-the-job training [OJT] and customized training) who attained a recognized postsecondary credential or a secondary school diploma, or its recognized equivalent, during participation in or within 1 year after exit from the program.

      (B) A participant who has attained a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent is included in the percentage of participants who have attained a secondary school diploma or recognized equivalent only if the participant also is employed or is enrolled in an education or training program leading to a recognized postsecondary credential within 1 year after exit from the program;

      (v) The percentage of participants who, during a program year, are in an education or training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential or employment and who are achieving measurable skill gains, defined as documented academic, technical, occupational, or other forms of progress, towards such a credential or employment. Depending upon the type of education or training program, documented progress is defined as one of the following:

      (A) Documented achievement of at least one educational functioning level of a participant who is receiving instruction below the postsecondary education level;

      (B) Documented attainment of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent;

      (C) Secondary or postsecondary transcript or report card for a sufficient number of credit hours that shows a participant is meeting the State unit's academic standards;

      (E) Successful passage of an exam that is required for a particular occupation or progress in attaining technical or occupational skills as evidenced by trade-related benchmarks such as knowledge-based exams.

      (vi) The percentage of participants in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the program who were employed by the same employer in the second and fourth quarters after exit. For the six core programs, this indicator is a statewide indicator reported by one core program on behalf of all six core programs in the State, as described in guidance.

      (2)  For purposes of the primary indicators of performance in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, “participant” will have the meaning given to it in § 677.150(a), except that—

      (i) For purposes of determining program performance levels under indicators set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) and (vi) of this section, a “participant” does not include a participant who received services under sec. 225 of WIOA and exits such program while still in a correctional institution as defined in sec. 225(e)(1) of WIOA; and

      (ii) The Secretaries of Labor and Education may, as needed and consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), make further determinations as to the participants to be included in calculating program performance levels for purposes of any of the performance indicators set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (b) The primary indicators in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) and (vi) of this section apply to the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III.

      (c) For the youth program authorized under WIOA title I, the primary indicators are:

      (1) Percentage of participants who are in education or training activities, or in unsubsidized employment, during the second quarter after exit from the program;

      (5) The percentage of participants who during a program year, are in an education or training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential or employment and who are achieving measurable skill gains, defined as documented academic, technical, occupational or other forms of progress towards such a credential or employment. Depending upon the type of education or training program, documented progress is defined as one of the following:

      (i) Documented achievement of at least one educational functioning level of a participant who is receiving instruction below the postsecondary education level;

      (ii) Documented attainment of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent;

      (iii) Secondary or postsecondary transcript or report card for a sufficient number of credit hours that shows a participant is achieving the State unit's academic standards;

      (iv) Satisfactory or better progress report, towards established milestones, such as completion of OJT or completion of 1 year of an apprenticeship program or similar milestones, from an employer or training provider who is providing training; or

      (v) Successful passage of an exam that is required for a particular occupation or progress in attaining technical or occupational skills as evidenced by trade-related benchmarks such as knowledge-based exams.

      (6) The percentage of participants in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the program who were employed by the same employer in the second and fourth quarters after exit. For the six core programs, this indicator is a statewide indicator reported by one core program on behalf of all six core programs in the State, as described in guidance.

      (f) States must comply with these requirements from sec. 116 of WIOA as explained in joint guidance issued by the Departments of Labor and Education.

      § 677.175   What responsibility do States have to use quarterly wage record information for performance accountability?

#### § § 677.175

      (a)(1) States must, consistent with State laws, use quarterly wage record information in measuring a State's performance on the primary indicators of performance outlined in § 677.155 and a local area's performance on the primary indicators of performance identified in § 677.205.

      (2) The use of social security numbers from participants and such other information as is necessary to measure the progress of those participants through quarterly wage record information is authorized.

      (3) To the extent that quarterly wage records are not available for a participant, States may use other information as is necessary to measure the progress of those participants through methods other than quarterly wage record information.

      (b) “Quarterly wage record information” means intrastate and interstate wages paid to an individual, the social security number (or numbers, if more than one) of the individual, and the name, address, State, and the Federal employer identification number of the employer paying the wages to the individual.

      (c) The Governor may designate a State agency (or appropriate State entity) to assist in carrying out the performance reporting requirements for WIOA core programs and ETPs. The Governor or such agency (or appropriate State entity) is responsible for:

      (1) Facilitating data matches;

      (2) Data quality reliability; and

      (3) Protection against disaggregation that would violate applicable privacy standards.

    Subpart B—Sanctions for State Performance and the Provision of Technical Assistance

      § 677.180   When is a State subject to a financial sanction under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 677.180

      A State will be subject to financial sanction under WIOA sec. 116(f) if it fails to:

      (a) Submit the State annual performance report required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2); or

      (b) Meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance in accordance with sec. 116(f) of WIOA.

      § 677.185   When are sanctions applied for a State's failure to submit an annual performance report?

#### § § 677.185

      (a) Sanctions will be applied when a State fails to submit the State annual performance report required under sec. 116(d)(2) of WIOA. A State fails to report if the State either:

      (1) Does not submit a State annual performance report by the date for timely submission set in performance reporting guidance; or

      (2) Submits a State annual performance report by the date for timely submission, but the report is incomplete.

      (b) Sanctions will not be applied if the reporting failure is due to exceptional circumstances outside of the State's control. Exceptional circumstances may include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Natural disasters;

      (2) Unexpected personnel transitions; and

      (3) Unexpected technology related issues.

      (c) In the event that a State may not be able to submit a complete and accurate performance report by the deadline for timely reporting:

      (1) The State must notify the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior to the established deadline for submission, of a potential impact on the State's ability to submit its State annual performance report in order to not be considered failing to report.

      (2) In circumstances where unexpected events occur less than 30 days before the established deadline for submission of the State annual performance reports, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will review requests for extending the reporting deadline in accordance with the Departments of Labor and Education's procedures that will be established in guidance.

      § 677.190   When are sanctions applied for failure to achieve adjusted levels of performance?

#### § § 677.190

      (a) States' negotiated levels of performance will be adjusted through the application of the statistical adjustment model established under § 677.170 to account for actual economic conditions experienced during a program year and characteristics of participants, annually at the close of each program year.

      (b) Any State that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance outlined in § 677.155 for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education.

      (c) Whether a State has failed to meet adjusted levels of performance will be determined using the following criteria:

      (1) The overall State program score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by a core program on the primary indicators of performance, except for the effectiveness in serving employers indicator described in § 677.155(a)(1)(vi), to the adjusted levels of performance for that core program. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators, except for the effectiveness in serving employers indicator described in § 677.155(a)(1)(vi), by a core program will constitute the overall State program score.

      (2) However, until all indicators for the core program have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State program score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data for that program.

      (3) The overall State indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved on a primary indicator of performance by all core programs in a State to the adjusted levels of performance for that primary indicator.

      (i) The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance by all of the core programs on that indicator will constitute the overall State indicator score, except for the effectiveness in serving employers indicator described in § 677.155(a)(1)(vi).

      (ii) The overall State indicator score for effectiveness in serving employers, as reported by one core program on behalf of all six core programs in the State, as described in guidance, is a statewide indicator that reflects the performance for all core programs. It is calculated as the statewide percentage achieved of the statewide adjusted level of performance.

      (4) However, until all indicators for the State have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State indicator score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data in a State.

      (5) The individual indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by each core program on each of the individual primary indicators to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the program's primary indicators of performance, except for the effectiveness in serving employers indicator described in § 677.155(a)(1)(vi).

      (d) A performance failure occurs when:

      (1) Any overall State program score or overall State indicator score falls below 90 percent for the program year; or

      (2) Any of the States' individual indicator scores fall below 50 percent for the program year.

      (e) Sanctions based on performance failure will be applied to States if, for 2 consecutive years, the State fails to meet:

      (1) 90 percent of the overall State program score for the same core program;

      (2) 90 percent of the overall State indicator score for the same primary indicator; or

      (3) 50 percent of the same indicator score for the same program.

      § 677.195   What should States expect when a sanction is applied to the Governor's Reserve Allotment?

#### § § 677.195

      (a) The Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by five percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year if:

      (1) The State fails to submit the State annual performance reports as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2), as defined in § 677.185;

      (2) The State fails to meet State adjusted levels of performance for the same primary performance indicator(s) under either § 677.190(d)(1) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 677.190; or

      (3) The State's score on the same indicator for the same program falls below 50 percent under § 677.190(d)(2) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 677.190.

      (b) If the State fails under paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (3) of this section in the same program year, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by 10 percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year.

      (c) If a State's Governor's Reserve Allotment is reduced:

      (1) The reduced amount will not be returned to the State in the event that the State later improves performance or submits its annual performance report; and

      (2) The Governor's Reserve will continue to be set at the reduced level in each subsequent year until the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education, depending on which program is impacted, determines that the State met the State adjusted levels of performance for the applicable primary performance indicators and has submitted all of the required performance reports.

      (d) A State may request review of a sanction the Secretary of Labor imposes in accordance with the provisions of § 683.800 of this chapter.

      § 677.200   What other administrative actions will be applied to States' performance requirements?

#### § § 677.200

      (a) In addition to sanctions for failure to report or failure to meet adjusted levels of performance, States will be subject to administrative actions in the case of poor performance.

      (b) States' performance achievement on the individual primary indicators will be assessed in addition to the overall State program score and overall State indicator score. Based on this assessment, as clarified and explained in guidance, for performance on any individual primary indicator, the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education will require the State to establish a performance risk plan to address continuous improvement on the individual primary indicator.

    Subpart C—Local Performance Accountability for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Title I Programs

      § 677.205   What performance indicators apply to local areas and what information must be included in local area performance reports?

#### § § 677.205

      (a) Each local area in a State under WIOA title I is subject to the same primary indicators of performance for the core programs for WIOA title I under § 677.155(a)(1) and (c) that apply to the State.

      (b) In addition to the indicators described in paragraph (a) of this section, under § 677.165, the Governor may apply additional indicators of performance to local areas in the State.

      (c) States must annually make local area performance reports available to the public using a template that the Departments of Labor and Education will disseminate in guidance, including by electronic means. The State must provide electronic access to the public local area performance report in its annual State performance report.

      (d) The local area performance report must include:

      (1) The actual results achieved under § 677.155 and the information required under § 677.160(a);

      (2) The percentage of a local area's allotment under WIOA secs. 128(b) and 133(b) that the local area spent on administrative costs; and

      (3) Other information that facilitates comparisons of programs with programs in other local areas (or planning regions if the local area is part of a planning region).

      (e) The disaggregation of data for the local area performance report must be done in compliance with WIOA sec. 116(d)(6)(C).

      (f) States must comply with any requirements from sec. 116(d)(3) of WIOA as explained in guidance, including the use of the performance reporting template, issued by DOL.

      § 677.210   How are local performance levels established?

#### § § 677.210

      (a) The objective statistical adjustment model required under sec. 116(b)(3)(A)(viii) of WIOA and described in § 677.170(c) must be:

      (1) Applied to the core programs' primary indicators upon availability of data which are necessary to populate the model and apply the model to the local core programs;

      (2) Used in order to reach agreement on local negotiated levels of performance for the upcoming program year; and

      (3) Used to establish adjusted levels of performance at the end of a program year based on actual conditions, consistent with WIOA sec. 116(c)(3).

      (b) Until all indicators for the core program in a local area have at least 2 years of complete data, the comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the primary indicators only will be applied where there are at least 2 years of complete data for that program.

      (c) The Governor, Local Workforce Development Board (WDB), and chief elected official must reach agreement on local negotiated levels of performance based on a negotiations process before the start of a program year with the use of the objective statistical model described in paragraph (a) of this section. The negotiations will include a discussion of circumstances not accounted for in the model and will take into account the extent to which the levels promote continuous improvement. The objective statistical model will be applied at the end of the program year based on actual economic conditions and characteristics of the participants served.

      (d) The negotiations process described in paragraph (c) of this section must be developed by the Governor and disseminated to all Local WDBs and chief elected officials.

      (e) The Local WDBs may apply performance measures to service providers that differ from the performance indicators that apply to the local area. These performance measures must be established after considering:

      (1) The established local negotiated levels;

      (2) The services provided by each provider; and

      (3) The populations the service providers are intended to serve.

    Subpart D—Incentives and Sanctions for Local Performance for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Title I Programs

      § 677.215   Under what circumstances are local areas eligible for State Incentive Grants?

#### § § 677.215

      (a) The Governor is not required to award local incentive funds, but is authorized to provide incentive grants to local areas for performance on the primary indicators of performance consistent with WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(xi).

      (b) The Governor may use non-Federal funds to create incentives for the Local WDBs to implement pay-for-performance contract strategies for the delivery of training services described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3) or activities described in WIOA sec. 129(c)(2) in the local areas served by the Local WDBs. Pay-for-performance contract strategies must be implemented in accordance with part 683, subpart E of this chapter and § 677.160.

      § 677.220   Under what circumstances may a corrective action or sanction be applied to local areas for poor performance?

    (i) The last day of service cannot be determined until at least 90 days have elapsed since the participant last received services; services do not include self-service, information-only services or activities, or follow-up services. This also requires that there are no plans to provide the participant with future services.

    (ii) [Reserved].

    (2)(i) For the VR program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV (VR program):

    (A) The participant's record of service is closed in accordance with 34 CFR 361.56 because the participant has achieved an employment outcome; or

  PART 678—DESCRIPTION OF THE ONE-STOP DELIVERY SYSTEM UNDER TITLE I OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT

### Part 678

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 503, 107, 121, 134, 189, Pub. L. 113-128, 128 Stat. 1425 (Jul. 22, 2014).

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 56008, Aug. 19, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General Description of the One-Stop Delivery System

      § 678.300   What is the one-stop delivery system?

#### § § 678.300

      (a) The one-stop delivery system brings together workforce development, educational, and other human resource services in a seamless customer-focused service delivery network that enhances access to the programs' services and improves long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance. One-stop partners administer separately funded programs as a set of integrated streamlined services to customers.

      (b) Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) assigns responsibilities at the local, State, and Federal level to ensure the creation and maintenance of a one-stop delivery system that enhances the range and quality of education and workforce development services that employers and individual customers can access.

      (c) The system must include at least one comprehensive physical center in each local area as described in § 678.305.

      (d) The system may also have additional arrangements to supplement the comprehensive center. These arrangements include:

      (1) An affiliated site or a network of affiliated sites, where one or more partners make programs, services, and activities available, as described in § 678.310;

      (2) A network of eligible one-stop partners, as described in §§ 678.400 through 678.410, through which each partner provides one or more of the programs, services, and activities that are linked, physically or technologically, to an affiliated site or access point that assures customers are provided information on the availability of career services, as well as other program services and activities, regardless of where they initially enter the public workforce system in the local area; and

      (3) Specialized centers that address specific needs, including those of dislocated workers, youth, or key industry sectors, or clusters.

      (e) Required one-stop partner programs must provide access to programs, services, and activities through electronic means if applicable and practicable. This is in addition to providing access to services through the mandatory comprehensive physical one-stop center and any affiliated sites or specialized centers. The provision of programs and services by electronic methods such as Web sites, telephones, or other means must improve the efficiency, coordination, and quality of one-stop partner services. Electronic delivery must not replace access to such services at a comprehensive one-stop center or be a substitute to making services available at an affiliated site if the partner is participating in an affiliated site. Electronic delivery systems must be in compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA sec. 188 and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 38.

      (f) The design of the local area's one-stop delivery system must be described in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed with the one-stop partners, described in § 678.500.

      § 678.305   What is a comprehensive one-stop center and what must be provided there?

#### § § 678.305

      (a) A comprehensive one-stop center is a physical location where job seeker and employer customers can access the programs, services, and activities of all required one-stop partners. A comprehensive one-stop center must have at least one title I staff person physically present.

      (b) The comprehensive one-stop center must provide:

      (1) Career services, described in § 678.430;

      (2) Access to training services described in § 680.200 of this chapter;

      (3) Access to any employment and training activities carried out under sec. 134(d) of WIOA;

      (4) Access to programs and activities carried out by one-stop partners listed in §§ 678.400 through 678.410, including the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III (Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service program); and

      (5) Workforce and labor market information.

      (c) Customers must have access to these programs, services, and activities during regular business days at a comprehensive one-stop center. The Local Workforce Development Board (WDB) may establish other service hours at other times to accommodate the schedules of individuals who work on regular business days. The State WDB will evaluate the hours of access to service as part of the evaluation of effectiveness in the one-stop certification process described in § 678.800(b).

      (d) “Access” to each partner program and its services means:

      (1) Having a program staff member physically present at the one-stop center;

      (2) Having a staff member from a different partner program physically present at the one-stop center appropriately trained to provide information to customers about the programs, services, and activities available through partner programs; or

      (3) Making available a direct linkage through technology to program staff who can provide meaningful information or services.

      (i) A “direct linkage” means providing direct connection at the one-stop center, within a reasonable time, by phone or through a real-time Web-based communication to a program staff member who can provide program information or services to the customer.

      (ii) A “direct linkage” cannot exclusively be providing a phone number or computer Web site or providing information, pamphlets, or materials.

      (e) All comprehensive one-stop centers must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.

      § 678.310   What is an affiliated site and what must be provided there?

#### § § 678.310

      (a) An affiliated site, or affiliate one-stop center, is a site that makes available to job seeker and employer customers one or more of the one-stop partners' programs, services, and activities. An affiliated site does not need to provide access to every required one-stop partner program. The frequency of program staff's physical presence in the affiliated site will be determined at the local level. Affiliated sites are access points in addition to the comprehensive one-stop center(s) in each local area. If used by local areas as a part of the service delivery strategy, affiliate sites must be implemented in a manner that supplements and enhances customer access to services.

      (b) As described in § 678.315, Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot be a stand-alone affiliated site.

      (c) States, in conjunction with the Local WDBs, must examine lease agreements and property holdings throughout the one-stop delivery system in order to use property in an efficient and effective way. Where necessary and appropriate, States and Local WDBs must take expeditious steps to align lease expiration dates with efforts to consolidate one-stop operations into service points where Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are colocated as soon as reasonably possible. These steps must be included in the State Plan.

      (d) All affiliated sites must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.

      § 678.315   Can a stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service office be designated as an affiliated one-stop site?

#### § § 678.315

      (a) Separate stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service offices are not permitted under WIOA, as also described in § 652.202 of this chapter.

      (b) If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are provided at an affiliated site, there must be at least one or more other partners in the affiliated site with a physical presence of combined staff more than 50 percent of the time the center is open. Additionally, the other partner must not be the partner administering local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, or unemployment compensation programs. If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services and any of these 3 programs are provided at an affiliated site, an additional partner or partners must have a presence of combined staff in the center more than 50 percent of the time the center is open.

      § 678.320   Are there any requirements for networks of eligible one-stop partners or specialized centers?

#### § § 678.320

      Any network of one-stop partners or specialized centers, as described in § 678.300(d)(3), must be connected to the comprehensive one-stop center and any appropriate affiliate one-stop centers, for example, by having processes in place to make referrals to these centers and the partner programs located in them. Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot stand alone in a specialized center. Just as described in § 678.315 for an affiliated site, a specialized center must include other programs besides Wagner-Peyser Act employment services, local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, and unemployment compensation.

    Subpart B—One-Stop Partners and the Responsibilities of Partners

      § 678.400   Who are the required one-stop partners?

#### § § 678.400

      § 678.405   Is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families a required one-stop partner?

#### § § 678.405

      (a) Yes, TANF, authorized under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 ), is a required partner.

      (b) The Governor may determine that TANF will not be a required partner in the State, or within some specific local areas in the State. In this instance, the Governor must notify the Secretaries of the U.S. Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services in writing of this determination.

      (c) In States, or local areas within a State, where the Governor has determined that TANF is not required to be a partner, local TANF programs may still work in collaboration or partnership with the local one-stop centers to deliver employment and training services to the TANF population unless inconsistent with the Governor's direction.

The entity for the Native American program, YouthBuild, and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs is the grantee of those respective programs. The entity for Job Corps is the Job Corps center.

      (e) For the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the entity that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is the eligible recipient or recipients at the postsecondary level, or a consortium of eligible recipients at the postsecondary level in the local area.

      § 678.435   What are the business services provided through the one-stop delivery system, and how are they provided?

#### § § 678.435

      (a) Certain career services must be made available to local employers, specifically labor exchange activities and labor market information described in § 678.430(a)(4)(ii) and (a)(6). Local areas must establish and develop relationships and networks with large and small employers and their intermediaries.

      (c) Local areas may also provide other business services and strategies that meet the workforce investment needs of area employers, in accordance with partner programs' statutory requirements and consistent with Federal cost principles. These business services may be provided through effective business intermediaries working in conjunction with the Local WDB, or through the use of economic development, philanthropic, and other public and private resources in a manner determined appropriate by the Local WDB and in cooperation with the State. Allowable activities, consistent with each partner's authorized activities, include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Developing and implementing industry sector strategies (including strategies involving industry partnerships, regional skills alliances, industry skill panels, and sectoral skills partnerships);

      (2) Customized assistance or referral for assistance in the development of a registered apprenticeship program;

      (3) Developing and delivering innovative workforce investment services and strategies for area employers, which may include career pathways, skills upgrading, skill standard development and certification for recognized postsecondary credential or other employer use, and other effective initiatives for meeting the workforce investment needs of area employers and workers;

#### § § 678.440

      (a) There is no requirement that a fee-for-service be charged to employers.

      (b) No fee may be charged for services provided in § 678.435(a).

      (c) A fee may be charged for services provided under § 678.435(b) and (c). Services provided under § 678.435(c) may be provided through effective business intermediaries working in conjunction with the Local WDB and may also be provided on a fee-for-service basis or through the leveraging of economic development, philanthropic, and other public and private resources in a manner determined appropriate by the Local WDB. The Local WDB may examine the services provided compared with the assets and resources available within the local one-stop delivery system and through its partners to determine an appropriate cost structure for services, if any.

      (d) Any fees earned are recognized as program income and must be expended by the partner in accordance with the partner program's authorizing statute, implementing regulations, and Federal cost principles identified in Uniform Guidance.

    Subpart C—Memorandum of Understanding for the One-Stop Delivery System

      § 678.500   What is the Memorandum of Understanding for the one-stop delivery system and what must be included in the Memorandum of Understanding?

#### § § 678.500

      (a) The MOU is the product of local discussion and negotiation, and is an agreement developed and executed between the Local WDB and the one-stop partners, with the agreement of the chief elected official and the one-stop partners, relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system in the local area. Two or more local areas in a region may develop a single joint MOU, if they are in a region that has submitted a regional plan under sec. 106 of WIOA.

      (b) The MOU must include:

      (1) A description of services to be provided through the one-stop delivery system, including the manner in which the services will be coordinated and delivered through the system;

      (2) Agreement on funding the costs of the services and the operating costs of the system, including:

      (i) Funding of infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in accordance with §§ 678.700 through 678.755; and

      (ii) Funding of the shared services and operating costs of the one-stop delivery system described in § 678.760;

      (3) Methods for referring individuals between the one-stop operators and partners for appropriate services and activities;

      (4) Methods to ensure that the needs of workers, youth, and individuals with barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, are addressed in providing access to services, including access to technology and materials that are available through the one-stop delivery system;

      (5) The duration of the MOU and procedures for amending it; and

      (6) Assurances that each MOU will be reviewed, and if substantial changes have occurred, renewed, not less than once every 3-year period to ensure appropriate funding and delivery of services.

      (c) The MOU may contain any other provisions agreed to by the parties that are consistent with WIOA title I, the authorizing statutes and regulations of one-stop partner programs, and the WIOA regulations.

      (d) When fully executed, the MOU must contain the signatures of the Local WDB, one-stop partners, the chief elected official(s), and the time period in which the agreement is effective. The MOU must be updated not less than every 3 years to reflect any changes in the signatory official of the Board, one-stop partners, and chief elected officials, or one-stop infrastructure funding.

      (e) If a one-stop partner appeal to the State regarding infrastructure costs, using the process described in § 678.750, results in a change to the one-stop partner's infrastructure cost contributions, the MOU must be updated to reflect the final one-stop partner infrastructure cost contributions.

      § 678.505   Is there a single Memorandum of Understanding for the local area, or must there be different Memoranda of Understanding between the Local Workforce Development Board and each partner?

#### § § 678.505

      (a) A single “umbrella” MOU may be developed that addresses the issues relating to the local one-stop delivery system for the Local WDB, chief elected official and all partners. Alternatively, the Local WDB (with agreement of chief elected official) may enter into separate agreements between each partner or groups of partners.

      (b) Under either approach, the requirements described in § 678.500 apply. Since funds are generally appropriated annually, the Local WDB may negotiate financial agreements with each partner annually to update funding of services and operating costs of the system under the MOU.

      § 678.510   How must the Memorandum of Understanding be negotiated?

#### § § 678.510

      (a) WIOA emphasizes full and effective partnerships between Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners. Local WDBs and partners must enter into good-faith negotiations. Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners may also request assistance from a State agency responsible for administering the partner program, the Governor, State WDB, or other appropriate parties on other aspects of the MOU.

      (b) Local WDBs and one-stop partners must establish, in the MOU, how they will fund the infrastructure costs and other shared costs of the one-stop centers. If agreement regarding infrastructure costs is not reached when other sections of the MOU are ready, an interim infrastructure funding agreement may be included instead, as described in § 678.715(c). Once agreement on infrastructure funding is reached, the Local WDB and one-stop partners must amend the MOU to include the infrastructure funding of the one-stop centers. Infrastructure funding is described in detail in subpart E of this part.

      (c) The Local WDB must report to the State WDB, Governor, and relevant State agency when MOU negotiations with one-stop partners have reached an impasse.

      (1) The Local WDB and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place in the MOU. The State WDB, one-stop partner programs, and the Governor may consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations related to issues other than infrastructure funding after attempting to address the impasse. Impasses related to infrastructure cost funding must be resolved using the State infrastructure cost funding mechanism described in § 678.730.

      (2) The Local WDB must report failure to execute an MOU with a required partner to the Governor, State WDB, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program. Additionally, if the State cannot assist the Local WDB in resolving the impasse, the Governor or the State WDB must report the failure to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program.

    Subpart D—One-Stop Operators

      § 678.600   Who may operate one-stop centers?

#### § § 678.600

      (a) One-stop operators may be a single entity (public, private, or nonprofit) or a consortium of entities. If the consortium of entities is one of one-stop partners, it must include a minimum of three of the one-stop partners described in § 678.400.

      (b) The one-stop operator may operate one or more one-stop centers. There may be more than one one-stop operator in a local area.

      (c) The types of entities that may be a one-stop operator include:

      (1) An institution of higher education;

      (2) An Employment Service State agency established under the Wagner-Peyser Act;

      (3) A community-based organization, nonprofit organization, or workforce intermediary;

      (4) A private for-profit entity;

      (5) A government agency;

      (6) A Local WDB, with the approval of the chief elected official and the Governor; or

      (7) Another interested organization or entity, which is capable of carrying out the duties of the one-stop operator. Examples may include a local chamber of commerce or other business organization, or a labor organization.

      (d) Elementary schools and secondary schools are not eligible as one-stop operators, except that a nontraditional public secondary school such as a night school, adult school, or an area career and technical education school may be selected.

      (e) The State and Local WDBs must ensure that, in carrying out WIOA programs and activities, one-stop operators:

      (1) Disclose any potential conflicts of interest arising from the relationships of the operators with particular training service providers or other service providers (further discussed in § 679.430 of this chapter);

      (2) Do not establish practices that create disincentives to providing services to individuals with barriers to employment who may require longer-term career and training services; and

      (3) Comply with Federal regulations and procurement policies relating to the calculation and use of profits, including those at § 683.295 of this chapter, the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable regulations and policies.

      § 678.605   How is the one-stop operator selected?

#### § § 678.605

      (a) Consistent with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Local WDB must select the one-stop operator through a competitive process, as required by sec. 121(d)(2)(A) of WIOA, at least once every 4 years. A State may require, or a Local WDB may choose to implement, a competitive selection process more than once every 4 years.

      (b) In instances in which a State is conducting the competitive process described in paragraph (a) of this section, the State must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurement with non-Federal funds.

      (c) All other non-Federal entities, including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas), must use a competitive process based on local procurement policies and procedures and the principles of competitive procurement in the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326. All references to “noncompetitive proposals” in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.320(f) will be read as “sole source procurement” for the purposes of implementing this section.

      (d) Entities must prepare written documentation explaining the determination concerning the nature of the competitive process to be followed in selecting a one-stop operator.

      § 678.610   When is the sole-source selection of one-stop operators appropriate, and how is it conducted?

#### § § 678.610

      (a) States may select a one-stop operator through sole source selection when allowed under the same policies and procedures used for competitive procurement with non-Federal funds, while other non-Federal entities including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas) may select a one-stop operator through sole selection when consistent with local procurement policies and procedures and the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.320.

      (b) In the event that sole source procurement is determined necessary and reasonable, in accordance with § 678.605(c), written documentation must be prepared and maintained concerning the entire process of making such a selection.

      (c) Such sole source procurement must include appropriate conflict of interest policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.

      (d) A Local WDB may be selected as a one-stop operator through sole source procurement only with agreement of the chief elected official in the local area and the Governor. The Local WDB must establish sufficient conflict of interest policies and procedures and these policies and procedures must be approved by the Governor.

      § 678.615   May an entity currently serving as one-stop operator compete to be a one-stop operator under the procurement requirements of this subpart?

#### § § 678.615

      (a) Local WDBs may compete for and be selected as one-stop operators, as long as appropriate firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures are in place. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.

      (b) State and local agencies may compete for and be selected as one-stop operators by the Local WDB, as long as appropriate firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures are in place. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.

      (c) In the case of single-area States where the State WDB serves as the Local WDB, the State agency is eligible to compete for and be selected as operator as long as appropriate firewalls and conflict of interest policies are in place and followed for the competition. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflicts of interest.

      § 678.620   What is the one-stop operator's role?

#### § § 678.620

      (a) At a minimum, the one-stop operator must coordinate the service delivery of required one-stop partners and service providers. Local WDBs may establish additional roles of one-stop operator, including, but not limited to: Coordinating service providers across the one-stop delivery system, being the primary provider of services within the center, providing some of the services within the center, or coordinating service delivery in a multi-center area, which may include affiliated sites. The competition for a one-stop operator must clearly articulate the role of the one-stop operator.

      (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a one-stop operator may not perform the following functions: Convene system stakeholders to assist in the development of the local plan; prepare and submit local plans (as required under sec. 107 of WIOA); be responsible for oversight of itself; manage or significantly participate in the competitive selection process for one-stop operators; select or terminate one-stop operators, career services, and youth providers; negotiate local performance accountability measures; or develop and submit budget for activities of the Local WDB in the local area.

      (2) An entity serving as a one-stop operator, that also serves a different role within the one-stop delivery system, may perform some or all of these functions when it is acting in its other role, if it has established sufficient firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.

      § 678.625   Can a one-stop operator also be a service provider?

#### § § 678.625

      Yes, but there must be appropriate firewalls in place in regards to the competition, and subsequent oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The operator cannot develop, manage, or conduct the competition of a service provider in which it intends to compete. In cases where an operator is also a service provider, there must be firewalls and internal controls within the operator-service provider entity, as well as specific policies and procedures at the Local WDB level regarding oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The firewalls must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflicts of interest.

      § 678.630   Can State merit staff still work in a one-stop center where the operator is not a governmental entity?

#### § § 678.630

      Yes. State merit staff can continue to perform functions and activities in the one-stop center. The Local WDB and one-stop operator must establish a system for management of merit staff in accordance with State policies and procedures. Continued use of State merit staff for the provision of Wagner-Peyser Act services or services from other programs with merit staffing requirements must be included in the competition for and final contract with the one-stop operator when Wagner-Peyser Act services or services from other programs with merit staffing requirements are being provided.

      § 678.635   What is the compliance date of the provisions of this subpart?

#### § § 678.635

      (a) No later than July 1, 2017, one-stop operators selected under the competitive process described in this subpart must be in place and operating the one-stop center.

      (b) By November 17, 2016, every Local WDB must demonstrate it is taking steps to prepare for competition of its one-stop operator. This demonstration may include, but is not limited to, market research, requests for information, and conducting a cost and price analysis.

    Subpart E—One-Stop Operating Costs

      § 678.700   What are the one-stop infrastructure costs?

#### § § 678.700

      (a) Infrastructure costs of one-stop centers are nonpersonnel costs that are necessary for the general operation of the one-stop center, including:

      (1) Rental of the facilities;

      (2) Utilities and maintenance;

      (3) Equipment (including assessment-related products and assistive technology for individuals with disabilities); and

      (4) Technology to facilitate access to the one-stop center, including technology used for the center's planning and outreach activities.

      (b) Local WDBs may consider common identifier costs as costs of one-stop infrastructure.

      (c) Each entity that carries out a program or activities in a local one-stop center, described in §§ 678.400 through 678.410, must use a portion of the funds available for the program and activities to maintain the one-stop delivery system, including payment of the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers. These payments must be in accordance with this subpart; Federal cost principles, which require that all costs must be allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable to the program; and all other applicable legal requirements.

      § 678.705   What guidance must the Governor issue regarding one-stop infrastructure funding?

#### § § 678.705

      (a) The Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, the State WDB, and Local WDBs, and consistent with guidance and policies provided by the State WDB, must develop and issue guidance for use by local areas, specifically:

      (1) Guidelines for State-administered one-stop partner programs for determining such programs' contributions to a one-stop delivery system, based on such programs' proportionate use of such system, and relative benefit received, consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200, including determining funding for the costs of infrastructure; and

      (2) Guidance to assist Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners in local areas in determining equitable and stable methods of funding the costs of infrastructure at one-stop centers based on proportionate use and relative benefit received, and consistent with Federal cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200.

      (b) The guidance must include:

      (1) The appropriate roles of the one-stop partner programs in identifying one-stop infrastructure costs;

      (2) Approaches to facilitate equitable and efficient cost allocation that results in a reasonable cost allocation methodology where infrastructure costs are charged to each partner based on its proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received, consistent with Federal cost principles at 2 CFR part 200; and

      (3) The timelines regarding notification to the Governor for not reaching local agreement and triggering the State funding mechanism described in § 678.730, and timelines for a one-stop partner to submit an appeal in the State funding mechanism.

      § 678.710   How are infrastructure costs funded?

#### § § 678.710

      Infrastructure costs are funded either through the local funding mechanism described in § 678.715 or through the State funding mechanism described in § 678.730.

      § 678.715   How are one-stop infrastructure costs funded in the local funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.715

      (a) In the local funding mechanism, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners agree to amounts and methods of calculating amounts each partner will contribute for one-stop infrastructure funding, include the infrastructure funding terms in the MOU, and sign the MOU. The local funding mechanism must meet all of the following requirements:

      (1) The infrastructure costs are funded through cash and fairly evaluated non-cash and third-party in-kind partner contributions and include any funding from philanthropic organizations or other private entities, or through other alternative financing options, to provide a stable and equitable funding stream for ongoing one-stop delivery system operations;

      (2) Contributions must be negotiated between one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and the Local WDB and the amount to be contributed must be included in the MOU;

      (3) The one-stop partner program's proportionate share of funding must be calculated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200 based upon a reasonable cost allocation methodology whereby infrastructure costs are charged to each partner in proportion to its use of the one-stop center, relative to benefits received. Such costs must also be allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable;

      (4) Partner shares must be periodically reviewed and reconciled against actual costs incurred, and adjusted to ensure that actual costs charged to any one-stop partners are proportionate to the use of the one-stop center and relative to the benefit received by the one-stop partners and their respective programs or activities.

      (b) In developing the section of the MOU on one-stop infrastructure funding described in § 678.755, the Local WDB and chief elected officials will:

      (1) Ensure that the one-stop partners adhere to the guidance identified in § 678.705 on one-stop delivery system infrastructure costs.

      (2) Work with one-stop partners to achieve consensus and informally mediate any possible conflicts or disagreements among one-stop partners.

      (3) Provide technical assistance to new one-stop partners and local grant recipients to ensure that those entities are informed and knowledgeable of the elements contained in the MOU and the one-stop infrastructure costs arrangement.

      (c) The MOU may include an interim infrastructure funding agreement, including as much detail as the Local WDB has negotiated with one-stop partners, if all other parts of the MOU have been negotiated, in order to allow the partner programs to operate in the one-stop centers. The interim infrastructure funding agreement must be finalized within 6 months of when the MOU is signed. If the interim infrastructure funding agreement is not finalized within that timeframe, the Local WDB must notify the Governor, as described in § 678.725.

      § 678.720   What funds are used to pay for infrastructure costs in the local one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.720

      (a) In the local funding mechanism, one-stop partner programs may determine what funds they will use to pay for infrastructure costs. The use of these funds must be in accordance with the requirements in this subpart, and with the relevant partner's authorizing statutes and regulations, including, for example, prohibitions against supplanting non-Federal resources, statutory limitations on administrative costs, and all other applicable legal requirements. In the case of partners administering programs authorized by title I of WIOA, these infrastructure costs may be considered program costs. In the case of partners administering adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA, these funds must include Federal funds made available for the local administration of adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA. These funds may also include non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions. In the case of partners administering the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, funds used to pay for infrastructure costs may include funds available for local administrative expenses, non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions, and may include other funds made available by the State.

      (b) There are no specific caps on the amount or percent of overall funding a one-stop partner may contribute to fund infrastructure costs under the local funding mechanism, except that contributions for administrative costs may not exceed the amount available for administrative costs under the authorizing statute of the partner program. However, amounts contributed for infrastructure costs must be allowable and based on proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received by the partner program, taking into account the total cost of the one-stop infrastructure as well as alternate financing options, and must be consistent with 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles.

      (c) Cash, non-cash, and third-party in-kind contributions may be provided by one-stop partners to cover their proportionate share of infrastructure costs.

      (1) Cash contributions are cash funds provided to the Local WDB or its designee by one-stop partners, either directly or by an interagency transfer.

      (2) Non-cash contributions are comprised of—

      (i) Expenditures incurred by one-stop partners on behalf of the one-stop center; and

      (ii) Non-cash contributions or goods or services contributed by a partner program and used by the one-stop center.

      (3) Non-cash contributions, especially those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the partners' proportionate share.

      (4) Third-party in-kind contributions are:

      (i) Contributions of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, by a non-one-stop partner to support the one-stop center in general, not a specific partner; or

      (ii) Contributions by a non-one-stop partner of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, to a one-stop partner to support its proportionate share of one-stop infrastructure costs.

      (iii) In-kind contributions described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 and reconciled on a regular basis to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the proportionate share of the partner.

      (5) All partner contributions, regardless of the type, must be reconciled on a regular basis ( monthly or quarterly), comparing actual expenses incurred to relative benefits received, to ensure each partner program is contributing its proportionate share in accordance with the terms of the MOU.

      § 678.725   What happens if consensus on infrastructure funding is not reached at the local level between the Local Workforce Development Board, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners?

#### § § 678.725

      With regard to negotiations for infrastructure funding for Program Year (PY) 2017 and for each subsequent program year thereafter, if the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners do not reach consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism in accordance with the Governor's guidance issued under § 678.705 and consistent with the regulations in §§ 678.715 and 678.720, and include that consensus agreement in the signed MOU, then the Local WDB must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 678.705(b)(3). Once notified, the Governor must administer funding through the State funding mechanism, as described in §§ 678.730 through 678.738, for the program year impacted by the local area's failure to reach consensus.

      § 678.730   What is the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.730

      (a) Consistent with sec. 121(h)(1)(A)(i)(II) of WIOA, if the Local WDB, chief elected official, and one-stop partners in a local area do not reach consensus agreement on methods of sufficiently funding the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers for a program year, the State funding mechanism is applicable to the local area for that program year.

      (b) In the State funding mechanism, the Governor, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, determines one-stop partner contributions after consultation with the chief elected officials, Local WDBs, and the State WDB. This determination involves:

      (1) The application of a budget for one-stop infrastructure costs as described in § 678.735, based on either agreement reached in the local area negotiations or the State WDB formula outlined in § 678.745;

      (2) The determination of each local one-stop partner program's proportionate use of the one-stop delivery system and relative benefit received, consistent with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles, the partner programs' authorizing laws and regulations, and other applicable legal requirements described in § 678.736; and

      (3) The calculation of required statewide program caps on contributions to infrastructure costs from one-stop partner programs in areas operating under the State funding mechanism as described in § 678.738.

      (c) In certain situations, the Governor does not determine the infrastructure cost contributions for some one-stop partner programs under the State funding mechanism.

      (1) The Governor will not determine the contribution amounts for infrastructure funds for Native American program grantees described in part 684 of this chapter. The appropriate portion of funds to be provided by Native American program grantees to pay for one-stop infrastructure must be determined as part of the development of the MOU described in § 678.500 and specified in that MOU.

      (2) In States in which the policy-making authority is placed in an entity or official that is independent of the authority of the Governor with respect to the funds provided for adult education and literacy activities authorized under title II of WIOA, postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, or VR services authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (other than sec. 112 or part C), as amended by WIOA title IV, the determination of the amount each of the applicable partners must contribute to assist in paying the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers must be made by the official or chief officer of the entity with such authority, in consultation with the Governor.

      (d) Any duty, ability, choice, responsibility, or other action otherwise related to the determination of infrastructure costs contributions that is assigned to the Governor in §§ 678.730 through 678.745 also applies to this decision-making process performed by the official or chief officer described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      § 678.731   What are the steps to determine the amount to be paid under the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.731

      (a) To initiate the State funding mechanism, a Local WDB that has not reached consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism as provided in § 678.725 must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 678.705(b)(3).

      (b) Once a Local WDB has informed the Governor that no consensus has been reached:

      (1) The Local WDB must provide the Governor with local negotiation materials in accordance with § 678.735(a).

      (2) The Governor must determine the one-stop center budget by either:

      (i) Accepting a budget previously agreed upon by partner programs in the local negotiations, in accordance with § 678.735(b)(1); or

      (ii) Creating a budget for the one-stop center using the State WDB formula (described in § 678.745) in accordance with § 678.735(b)(3).

      (3) The Governor then must establish a cost allocation methodology to determine the one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 678.736.

      (4)(i) Using the methodology established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and taking into consideration the factors concerning individual partner programs listed in § 678.737(b)(2), the Governor must determine each partner's proportionate share of the infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 678.737(b)(1), and

      (ii) In accordance with § 678.730(c), in some instances, the Governor does not determine a partner program's proportionate share of infrastructure funding costs, in which case it must be determined by the entities named in § 678.730(c)(1) and (2).

      (5) The Governor must then calculate the statewide caps on the amounts that partner programs may be required to contribute toward infrastructure funding, according to the steps found at § 678.738(a)(1) through (4).

      (6) The Governor must ensure that the aggregate total of the infrastructure contributions according to proportionate share required of all local partner programs in local areas under the State funding mechanism do not exceed the cap for that particular program, in accordance with § 678.738(b)(1). If the total does not exceed the cap, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the amount determined under § 678.737(a) toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center. If the total does exceed the cap, then to determine the amount to direct each one-stop program to pay, the Governor may:

      (i) Ascertain, in accordance with § 678.738(b)(2)(i), whether the local partner or partners whose proportionate shares are calculated above the individual program caps are willing to voluntarily contribute above the capped amount to equal that program's proportionate share; or

      (ii) Choose from the options provided in § 678.738(b)(2)(ii), including having the local area re-enter negotiations to reassess each one-stop partner's proportionate share and make adjustments or identify alternate sources of funding to make up the difference between the capped amount and the proportionate share of infrastructure funding of the one-stop partner.

      (7) If none of the solutions given in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section prove to be viable, the Governor must reassess the proportionate shares of each one-stop partner so that the aggregate amount attributable to the local partners for each program is less than that program's cap amount. Upon such reassessment, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the reassessed amount toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center.

      § 678.735   How are infrastructure cost budgets for the one-stop centers in a local area determined in the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.735

      (a) Local WDBs must provide to the Governor appropriate and relevant materials and documents used in the negotiations under the local funding mechanism, including but not limited to: The local WIOA plan, the cost allocation method or methods proposed by the partners to be used in determining proportionate share, the proposed amounts or budget to fund infrastructure, the amount of total partner funds included, the type of funds or non-cash contributions, proposed one-stop center budgets, and any agreed upon or proposed MOUs.

      (b)(1) If a local area has reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, it must provide this budget to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section. If, as a result of the agreed upon infrastructure budget, only the individual programmatic contributions to infrastructure funding based upon proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received are at issue, the Governor may accept the budget, from which the Governor must calculate each partner's contribution consistent with the cost allocation methodologies contained in the Uniform Guidance found in 2 CFR part 200, as described in § 678.736.

      (2) The Governor may also take into consideration the extent to which the partners in the local area have agreed in determining the proportionate shares, including any agreements reached at the local level by one or more partners, as well as any other element or product of the negotiating process provided to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section.

      (3) If a local area has not reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, or if the Governor determines that the agreed upon budget does not adequately meet the needs of the local area or does not reasonably work within the confines of the local area's resources in accordance with the Governor's one-stop budget guidance (which is required to be issued by WIOA sec. 121(h)(1)(B) and under § 678.705), then, in accordance with § 678.745, the Governor must use the formula developed by the State WDB based on at least the factors required under § 678.745, and any associated weights to determine the local area budget.

      § 678.736   How does the Governor establish a cost allocation methodology used to determine the one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs under the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.736

      Once the appropriate budget is determined for a local area through either method described in § 678.735 (by acceptance of a budget agreed upon in local negotiation or by the Governor applying the formula detailed in § 678.745), the Governor must determine the appropriate cost allocation methodology to be applied to the one-stop partners in such local area, consistent with the Federal cost principles permitted under 2 CFR part 200, to fund the infrastructure budget.

      § 678.737   How are one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs determined under the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.737

      (a) The Governor must direct the one-stop partners in each local area that have not reached agreement under the local funding mechanism to pay what the Governor determines is each partner program's proportionate share of infrastructure funds for that area, subject to the application of the caps described in § 678.738.

      (b)(1) The Governor must use the cost allocation methodology—as determined under § 678.736—to determine each partner's proportionate share of the infrastructure costs under the State funding mechanism, subject to considering the factors described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) In determining each partner program's proportionate share of infrastructure costs, the Governor must take into account the costs of administration of the one-stop delivery system for purposes not related to one-stop centers for each partner (such as costs associated with maintaining the Local WDB or information technology systems), as well as the statutory requirements for each partner program, the partner program's ability to fulfill such requirements, and all other applicable legal requirements. The Governor may also take into consideration the extent to which the partners in the local area have agreed in determining the proportionate shares, including any agreements reached at the local level by one or more partners, as well as any other materials or documents of the negotiating process, which must be provided to the Governor by the Local WDB and described in § 678.735(a).

      § 678.738   How are statewide caps on the contributions for one-stop infrastructure funding determined in the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.738

      (a) The Governor must calculate the statewide cap on the contributions for one-stop infrastructure funding required to be provided by each one-stop partner program for those local areas that have not reached agreement. The cap is the amount determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which the Governor derives by:

      (1) First, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage for the corresponding one-stop partner program provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out the one-stop partner program in the State for the applicable fiscal year;

      (2) Second, selecting a factor (or factors) that reasonably indicates the use of one-stop centers in the State, applying such factor(s) to all local areas in the State, and determining the percentage of such factor(s) applicable to the local areas that reached agreement under the local funding mechanism in the State;

      (3) Third, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the one-stop partner program; and

      (4) Fourth, determining the amount that results from subtracting the amount determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The outcome of this final calculation results in the partner program's cap.

      (b)(1) The Governor must ensure that the funds required to be contributed by each partner program in the local areas in the State under the State funding mechanism, in aggregate, do not exceed the statewide cap for each program as determined under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (2) If the contributions initially determined under § 678.737 would exceed the applicable cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Governor may:

      (i) Ascertain if the one-stop partner whose contribution would otherwise exceed the cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section will voluntarily contribute above the capped amount, so that the total contributions equal that partner's proportionate share. The one-stop partner's contribution must still be consistent with the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements; or

      (ii) Direct or allow the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners to: Re-enter negotiations, as necessary; reduce the infrastructure costs to reflect the amount of funds that are available for such costs without exceeding the cap levels; reassess the proportionate share of each one-stop partner; or identify alternative sources of financing for one-stop infrastructure funding, consistent with the requirement that each one-stop partner pay an amount that is consistent with the proportionate use of the one-stop center and relative benefit received by the partner, the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements.

      (3) If applicable under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners, after renegotiation, may come to agreement, sign an MOU, and proceed under the local funding mechanism. Such actions do not require the redetermination of the applicable caps under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (4) If, after renegotiation, agreement among partners still cannot be reached or alternate financing cannot be identified, the Governor may adjust the specified allocation, in accordance with the amounts available and the limitations described in paragraph (d) of this section. In determining these adjustments, the Governor may take into account information relating to the renegotiation as well as the information described in § 678.735(a).

      (c)  Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and in accordance with WIOA sec. 121(h)(2)(D), the following limitations apply to the Governor's calculations of the amount that one-stop partners in local areas that have not reached agreement under the local funding mechanism may be required under § 678.736 to contribute to one-stop infrastructure funding:

      (1)  The portion of funds required to be contributed under the WIOA youth, adult, or dislocated worker programs, or under the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 ) must not exceed three percent of the amount of the program in the State for a program year.

      (2)  For required one-stop partners other than those specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, the portion of funds required to be contributed must not exceed 1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year. For purposes of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the cap on contributions is determined based on the funds made available by the State for postsecondary level programs and activities under sec. 132 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the amount of funds used by the State under sec. 112(a)(3) of the Perkins Act during the prior year to administer postsecondary level programs and activities, as applicable.

      (3)  (i) Within a State, for the entity or entities administering the programs described in WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(iv) and § 678.400, the allotment is based on the one State Federal fiscal year allotment, even in instances where that allotment is shared between two State agencies, and the cumulative portion of funds required to be contributed must not exceed—

      (A) 0.75 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2016 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2017;

      (B) 1.0 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2017 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2018;

      (C) 1.25 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2018 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2019;

      (D) 1.5 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2019 and following years for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2020 and subsequent years.

      (ii) The limitations set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section for any given fiscal year must be based on the final VR allotment to the State in the applicable Federal fiscal year.

      (4)  For local areas that have not reached a one-stop infrastructure funding agreement by consensus, an entity administering a program funded with direct Federal spending, as defined in sec. 250(c)(8) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as in effect on February 15, 2014 (2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)), must not be required to provide more for infrastructure costs than the amount that the Governor determined (as described in § 678.737).

      (5)  For purposes of TANF, the cap on contributions is determined based on the total Federal TANF funds expended by the State for work, education, and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year (as reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the quarterly TANF Financial Report form), plus any additional amount of Federal TANF funds that the State TANF agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative costs in connection with these activities but that was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution to the one-stop infrastructure must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.

      (6)  For purposes of CSBG, the cap on contributions will be based on the total amount of CSBG funds determined by the State to have been expended by local CSBG-eligible entities for the provision of employment and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year for which information is available (as reported to HHS on the CSBG Annual Report) and any additional amount that the State CSBG agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative purposes in connection with these activities and was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.

      (d) For programs for which it is not otherwise feasible to determine the amount of Federal funding used by the program until the end of that program's operational year—because, for example, the funding available for education, employment, and training activities is included within funding for the program that may also be used for other unrelated activities—the determination of the Federal funds provided to carry out the program for a fiscal year under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be determined by:

      (1) The percentage of Federal funds available to the one-stop partner program that were used by the one-stop partner program for education, employment, and training activities in the previous fiscal year for which data are available; and

      (2) Applying the percentage determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the total amount of Federal funds available to the one-stop partner program for the fiscal year for which the determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.

      § 678.740   What funds are used to pay for infrastructure costs in the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.740

      (a) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for WIOA title I programs, including Native American Programs described in part 684 of this chapter, may be paid using program funds, administrative funds, or both. Infrastructure costs for the Senior Community Service Employment Program under title V of the Older Americans Act (42 U.S.C. 3056 ) may also be paid using program funds, administrative funds, or both.

      (b) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for other required one-stop partner programs (listed in §§ 678.400 through 678.410) are limited to the program's administrative funds, as appropriate.

      (c) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the adult education program authorized by title II of WIOA must be paid from the funds that are available for local administration and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.

      (d) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 must be paid from funds available for local administration of postsecondary level programs and activities to eligible recipients or consortia of eligible recipients and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.

      § 678.745   What factors does the State Workforce Development Board use to develop the formula described in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which is used by the Governor to determine the appropriate one-stop infrastructure budget for each local area operating under the State infrastructure funding mechanism, if no reasonably implementable locally negotiated budget exists?

#### § § 678.745

      The State WDB must develop a formula, as described in WIOA sec. 121(h)(3)(B), to be used by the Governor under § 678.735(b)(3) in determining the appropriate budget for the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in the local areas that do not reach agreement under the local funding mechanism and are, therefore, subject to the State funding mechanism. The formula identifies the factors and corresponding weights for each factor that the Governor must use, which must include: The number of one-stop centers in a local area; the population served by such centers; the services provided by such centers; and any factors relating to the operations of such centers in the local area that the State WDB determines are appropriate. As indicated in § 678.735(b)(1), if the local area has agreed on such a budget, the Governor may accept that budget in lieu of applying the formula factors.

      § 678.750   When and how can a one-stop partner appeal a one-stop infrastructure amount designated by the State under the State infrastructure funding mechanism?

#### § § 678.750

      (a) The Governor must establish a process, described under sec. 121(h)(2)(E) of WIOA, for a one-stop partner administering a program described in §§ 678.400 through 678.410 to appeal the Governor's determination regarding the one-stop partner's portion of funds to be provided for one-stop infrastructure costs. This appeal process must be described in the Unified State Plan.

      (b) The appeal may be made on the ground that the Governor's determination is inconsistent with proportionate share requirements in § 678.735(a), the cost contribution limitations in § 678.735(b), the cost contribution caps in § 678.738, consistent with the process described in the State Plan.

      (c) The process must ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of § 683.630 of this chapter.

      (d) The one-stop partner must submit an appeal in accordance with State's deadlines for appeals specified in the guidance issued under § 678.705(b)(3), or if the State has not set a deadline, within 21 days from the Governor's determination.

      § 678.755   What are the required elements regarding infrastructure funding that must be included in the one-stop Memorandum of Understanding?

#### § § 678.755

      The MOU, fully described in § 678.500, must contain the following information whether the local areas use either the local one-stop or the State funding method:

      (a) The period of time in which this infrastructure funding agreement is effective. This may be a different time period than the duration of the MOU.

      (b) Identification of an infrastructure and shared services budget that will be periodically reconciled against actual costs incurred and adjusted accordingly to ensure that it reflects a cost allocation methodology that demonstrates how infrastructure costs are charged to each partner in proportion to its use of the one-stop center and relative benefit received, and that complies with 2 CFR part 200 (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling).

      (c) Identification of all one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and Local WDB participating in the infrastructure funding arrangement.

      (d) Steps the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners used to reach consensus or an assurance that the local area followed the guidance for the State funding process.

      (e) Description of the process to be used among partners to resolve issues during the MOU duration period when consensus cannot be reached.

      (f) Description of the periodic modification and review process to ensure equitable benefit among one-stop partners.

      § 678.760   How do one-stop partners jointly fund other shared costs under the Memorandum of Understanding?

#### § § 678.760

      (a) In order to assist in administration of the grant funds, the chief elected official or the Governor, where the Governor serves as the local grant recipient for a local area, may designate an entity to serve as a local fiscal agent. Designation of a fiscal agent does not relieve the chief elected official or Governor of liability for the misuse of grant funds. If the CEO designates a fiscal agent, the CEO must ensure this agent has clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

      (b) In general the fiscal agent is responsible for the following functions:

      (1) Receive funds.

      (2) Ensure sustained fiscal integrity and accountability for expenditures of funds in accordance with Office of Management and Budget circulars, WIOA and the corresponding Federal Regulations and State policies.

      (3) Respond to audit financial findings.

### Part 680

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 122, 134, 189, 503, Pub. L. 113-128, 128 Stat. 1425 (Jul. 22, 2014).

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 56385, Aug. 19, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Delivery of Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities Under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act

      § 680.100   What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker programs in the one-stop delivery system?

#### § § 680.100

      (a) The one-stop delivery system is the basic delivery system for adult and dislocated worker services. Through this system, adults and dislocated workers can access a continuum of services. The services are classified as career and training services.

      (b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local grant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated worker programs, is a required one-stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with those provisions:

      (1) Career services for adults and dislocated workers must be made available in at least one one-stop center in each local area. Services also may be available elsewhere, either at affiliated sites or at specialized centers. For example, specialized centers may be established to serve workers being dislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve residents of public housing.

      (2) Through the one-stop delivery system, adults and dislocated workers needing training are provided Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) and access to lists of eligible training providers and programs of training. These lists contain quality consumer information, including cost and performance information for each of the providers' programs, so that participants can make informed choices on where to use their ITAs. (ITAs are more fully discussed in subpart C of this part.)

      § 680.110   When must adults and dislocated workers be registered and considered a participant?

#### § § 680.110

      (a) Registration is the process for collecting information to support a determination of eligibility. This information may be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's application. Individuals are considered participants when they have received a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) service other than self-service or information-only activities and have satisfied all applicable programmatic requirements for the provision of services, such as eligibility determination ( § 677.150(a) of this chapter).

      (b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under WIOA title I other than self-service or information-only activities must be registered and must be a participant.

      (c) EO data, as defined in § 675.300 of this chapter, must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the grant recipient or designated service provider.

      § 680.120   What are the eligibility criteria for career services for adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?

#### § § 680.120

      To be eligible to receive career services as an adult in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must be 18 years of age or older. To be eligible for any dislocated worker programs, an eligible adult must meet the criteria of § 680.130. Eligibility criteria for training services are found at § 680.210.

      § 680.130   What are the eligibility criteria for career services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?

#### § § 680.130

      (a) To be eligible to receive career services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must meet the definition of “dislocated worker” at WIOA sec. 3(15). Eligibility criteria for training services are found at § 680.210.

      (b) Governors and Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) may establish policies and procedures for one-stop centers to use in determining an individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIOA sec. 3(15). These policies and procedures may address such conditions as:

      (1) What constitutes a “general announcement” of plant closing under WIOA sec. 3(15)(B)(ii) or (iii);

      (2) What constitutes “unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters” for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, including family members and farm workers or ranch hands, under WIOA sec. 3(15)(C); and

      (3) What constitutes “unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation” under WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(iii), consistent with § 680.660.

      § 680.140   What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I adult and dislocated worker services are Local Workforce Development Boards required and permitted to provide?

#### § § 680.140

      (a) WIOA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults and dislocated workers must be used to provide career and training services through the one-stop delivery system. Local WDBs determine the most appropriate mix of these services, but both types must be available for eligible adults and dislocated workers. Different eligibility criteria apply for each type of services.  §§ 680.120, 680.130, and 680.210.

      (b) WIOA title I funds also may be used to provide the additional services described in WIOA sec. 134(d), including:

      (1) Job seeker services, such as:

      (i) Customer support to enable individuals with barriers to employment (including individuals with disabilities) and veterans, to navigate among multiple services and activities;

      (ii) Training programs for displaced homemakers and for individuals training for nontraditional employment (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(37) as occupations or fields of work in which individuals of one gender comprise less than 25 percent of the individuals so employed), in conjunction with programs operated in the local area;

      (iii) Work support activities for low-wage workers, in coordination with one-stop partners, which will provide opportunities for these workers to retain or enhance employment. These activities may include any activities available under the WIOA adult and dislocated worker programs in coordination with activities and resources available through partner programs. These activities may be provided in a manner that enhances the worker's ability to participate, for example by providing them at nontraditional hours or providing on-site child care;

      (iv) Supportive services, including needs-related payments, as described in subpart G of this part; and

      (v) Transitional jobs, as described in § 680.190, to individuals with barriers to employment who are chronically unemployed or have an inconsistent work history;

      (2) Employer services, such as:

      (i) Customized screening and referral of qualified participants in training services to employers;

      (ii) Customized employment-related services to employers, employer associations, or other such organization on a fee-for-service basis that are in addition to labor exchange services available to employers under the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service;

      (iii) Activities to provide business services and strategies that meet the workforce investment needs of area employers, as determined by the Local WDB and consistent with the local plan ( § 678.435 of this chapter and WIOA sec. 134(d)(1)(A)(ix)); and

      (3) Coordination activities, such as:

      (i) Employment and training activities in coordination with child support enforcement activities, as well as child support services and assistance activities, of the State and local agencies carrying out part D of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 );

      (ii) Employment and training activities in coordination with cooperative extension programs carried out by the Department of Agriculture;

      (iii) Employment and training activities in coordination with activities to facilitate remote access to services provided through a one-stop delivery system, including facilitating access through the use of technology;

      (iv) Improving coordination between workforce investment activities and economic development activities carried out within the local area involved, and to promote entrepreneurial skills training and microenterprise services;

      (v) Improving services and linkages between the local workforce development system (including the local one-stop delivery system) and employers, including small employers, in the local area;

      (vi) Strengthening linkages between the one-stop delivery system and the unemployment insurance programs; and

      (vii) Improving coordination between employment and training activities and programs carried out in the local area for individuals with disabilities, including programs carried out by State agencies relating to intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities, activities carried out by Statewide Independent Living Councils established under sec. 705 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 796d), programs funded under part B of chapter 1 of title VII of such Act (29 U.S.C. 796e ), and activities carried out by centers for independent living, as defined in sec. 702 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 796a);

      (4) Implementing a Pay-for-Performance contract strategy for training services in accordance with §§ 683.500 through 683.530 of this chapter for which up to 10 percent of the Local WDB's total adult and dislocated worker funds may be used;

      (5) Technical assistance for one-stop centers, partners, and eligible training providers (ETPs) on the provision of service to individuals with disabilities in local areas, including staff training and development, provision of outreach and intake assessments, service delivery, service coordination across providers and programs, and development of performance accountability measures;

      (6) Activities to adjust the economic self-sufficiency standards referred to in WIOA sec. 134(a)(3)(A)(xii) for local factors or activities to adopt, calculate or commission for approval, economic self-sufficiency standards for the local areas that specify the income needs of families, by family size, the number and ages of children in the family, and sub-State geographical considerations;

      (7) Implementing promising service to workers and businesses, which may include support for education, training, skill upgrading, and statewide networking for employees to become workplace learning advisors and maintain proficiency in carrying out the activities associated with such advising; and

      (8) Incumbent worker training programs, as described in subpart F of this part.

      § 680.150   What career services must be provided to adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 680.150

      (a) At a minimum, all of the basic career services described in WIOA secs. 134(c)(2)(A)(i)-(xi) and § 678.430(a) of this chapter must be provided in each local area through the one-stop delivery system.

      (b) Individualized career services described in WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii) and § 678.430(b) of this chapter must be made available, if determined appropriate in order for an individual to obtain or retain employment.

      § 680.160   How are career services delivered?

#### § § 680.160

      Career services must be provided through the one-stop delivery system. Career services may be provided directly by the one-stop operator or through contracts with service providers that are approved by the Local WDB. The Local WDB only may be a provider of career services when approved by the chief elected official and the Governor in accordance with the requirements of WIOA sec. 107(g)(2) and § 679.410 of this chapter.

      § 680.170   What is the individual employment plan?

#### § § 680.170

      The individual employment plan (IEP) is an individualized career service, under WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii)(II), that is developed jointly by the participant and career planner when determined appropriate by the one-stop center or one-stop partner. The plan is an ongoing strategy to identify employment goals, achievement objectives, and an appropriate combination of services for the participant to achieve the employment goals.

      § 680.180   What is an internship or work experience for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 680.180

      For the purposes of WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii)(VII), an internship or work experience is a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Internships and other work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate and consistent with other laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. An internship or other work experience may be arranged within the private for profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience setting where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, exists. Transitional jobs are a type of work experience, as described in §§ 680.190 and 680.195.

      § 680.190   What is a transitional job?

#### § § 680.190

      A transitional job is one that provides a time-limited work experience, that is wage-paid and subsidized, and is in the public, private, or non-profit sectors for those individuals with barriers to employment who are chronically unemployed or have inconsistent work history, as determined by the Local WDB. These jobs are designed to enable an individual to establish a work history, demonstrate work success in an employee-employer relationship, and develop the skills that lead to unsubsidized employment.

      § 680.195   What funds may be used for transitional jobs?

#### § § 680.195

      The local area may use up to 10 percent of their combined total of adult and dislocated worker allocations for transitional jobs as described in § 680.190. Transitional jobs must be combined with comprehensive career services ( § 680.150) and supportive services ( § 680.900).

    Subpart B—Training Services

      § 680.200   What are training services for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 680.200

      § 680.210   Who may receive training services?

#### § § 680.210

      Under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(A) training services may be made available to employed and unemployed adults and dislocated workers who:

      (a) A one-stop center or one-stop partner determines, after an interview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning, are:

      (1) Unlikely or unable to obtain or retain employment that leads to economic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than wages from previous employment through career services;

      (2) In need of training services to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than wages from previous employment; and

      (3) Have the skills and qualifications to participate successfully in training services;

      (b) Select a program of training services that is directly linked to the employment opportunities in the local area or the planning region, or in another area to which the individuals are willing to commute or relocate;

      (c) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of such training, including such sources as State-funded training funds, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), and Federal Pell Grants established under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or require WIOA assistance in addition to other sources of grant assistance, including Federal Pell Grants (provisions relating to fund coordination are found at § 680.230 and WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(B)); and

      (d) If training services are provided through the adult funding stream, are determined eligible in accordance with the State and local priority system in effect for adults under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E) and § 680.600.

      § 680.220   Are there particular career services an individual must receive before receiving training services under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 680.220

      (a) Yes, except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, an individual must at a minimum receive either an interview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning or any other method through which the one-stop center or partner can obtain enough information to make an eligibility determination to be determined eligible for training services under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(A)(i) and § 680.210. Where appropriate, a recent interview, evaluation, or assessment, may be used for the assessment purpose.

      (b) The case file must contain a determination of need for training services under § 680.210 as determined through the interview, evaluation, or assessment, and career planning informed by local labor market information and training provider performance information, or through any other career service received. There is no requirement that career services be provided as a condition to receipt of training services; however, if career services are not provided before training, the Local WDB must document the circumstances that justified its determination to provide training without first providing the services described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) There is no Federally required minimum time period for participation in career services before receiving training services.

      § 680.230   What are the requirements for coordination of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act training funds and other grant assistance?

#### § § 680.230

      (a) WIOA funding for training is limited to participants who:

      (1) Are unable to obtain grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of their training; or

      (2) Require assistance beyond that available under grant assistance from other sources to pay the costs of such training. Programs and training providers must coordinate funds available to pay for training as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. In making the determination under this paragraph (a), one-stop centers may take into account the full cost of participating in training services, including the cost of support services and other appropriate costs.

      (b) One-stop centers must coordinate training funds available and make funding arrangements with one-stop partners and other entities to apply the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. One-stop centers must consider the availability of other sources of grants to pay for training costs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), State-funded training funds, and Federal Pell Grants, so that WIOA funds supplement other sources of training grants.

      (c) A WIOA participant may enroll in WIOA-funded training while his/her application for a Pell Grant is pending as long as the one-stop center has made arrangements with the training provider and the WIOA participant regarding allocation of the Pell Grant, if it is subsequently awarded. In that case, the training provider must reimburse the one-stop center the WIOA funds used to underwrite the training for the amount the Pell Grant covers, including any education fees the training provider charges to attend training. Reimbursement is not required from the portion of Pell Grant assistance disbursed to the WIOA participant for education-related expenses.

    Subpart C—Individual Training Accounts

      § 680.300   How are training services provided?

#### § § 680.300

      Training services for eligible individuals are typically provided by training providers who receive payment for their services through an ITA. The ITA is a payment agreement established on behalf of a participant with a training provider. WIOA title I adult and dislocated workers purchase training services from State eligible training providers they select in consultation with the career planner, which includes discussion of program quality and performance information on the available eligible training providers. Payments from ITAs may be made in a variety of ways, including the electronic transfer of funds through financial institutions, vouchers, or other appropriate methods. Payments also may be made incrementally, for example, through payment of a portion of the costs at different points in the training course. Under limited conditions, as provided in § 680.320 and WIOA sec. 134(d)(3)(G), a Local WDB may contract for these services, rather than using an ITA for this purpose. In some limited circumstances, the Local WDB may itself provide the training services, but only if it obtains a waiver from the Governor for this purpose, and the Local WDB meets the other requirements of § 679.410 of this chapter and WIOA sec. 107(g)(1).

      § 680.310   Can the duration and amount of Individual Training Accounts be limited?

#### § § 680.310

      (a) Yes, the State or Local WDB may impose limits on ITAs, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.

      (b) Limits to ITAs may be established in different ways:

      (1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the IEP, such as the participant's occupational choice or goal and the level of training needed to succeed in that goal; or

      (2) There may be a policy decision by the State WDB or Local WDB to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount applicable to all ITAs.

      (c) Limitations established by State or Local WDB policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but must not be implemented in a manner that undermines WIOA's requirement that training services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an ETP. Exceptions to ITA limitations may be provided for individual cases and must be described in State or Local WDB policies.

      (d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.

      § 680.320   Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than Individual Training Accounts be used to provide training services?

#### § § 680.320

      (a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITAs only when one or more of the following five exceptions apply, and the local area has fulfilled the consumer choice requirements of § 680.340:

      (1) When the services provided are on-the-job-training (OJT), customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional jobs.

      (2) When the Local WDB determines that there are an insufficient number of eligible training providers in the local area to accomplish the purpose of a system of ITAs. The determination process must include a public comment period for interested providers of at least 30 days, and be described in the Local Plan.

      (a) This subpart describes the process for determining eligible training providers and programs for WIOA title I, subtitle B adult, dislocated worker, and out-of-school youth (OSY) aged 16-24 training participants and for publicly disseminating the list of these providers with relevant information about their programs. The workforce development system established under WIOA emphasizes informed consumer choice, job-driven training, provider performance, and continuous improvement. The quality and selection of providers and programs of training services is vital to achieving these core principles.

      (b) The State list of eligible training providers and programs and the related eligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality and labor-market relevance of programs of training services that receive funds through WIOA title I, subtitle B. The State list of eligible training providers and programs also is a means for ensuring informed customer choice for individuals eligible for training. In administering the eligible training provider eligibility process, States and local areas must work to ensure that qualified providers offering a wide variety of job-driven programs of training services are available. The State list of eligible training providers and programs is made publicly available online through Web sites and searchable databases as well as any other means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers, including formats accessible to individuals with disabilities. The list must be accompanied by relevant performance and cost information and must be presented in a way that is easily understood, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population groups, and also must be available in an electronic format. The State eligible training provider performance reports, as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4), are addressed separately in § 677.230 of this chapter.

      § 680.410   What is an eligible training provider?

      (a) All registered apprenticeship programs that are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Apprenticeship, or a recognized State apprenticeship agency, are automatically eligible to be included in the State list of eligible training providers and programs. All registered apprenticeship programs must be informed of their automatic eligibility to be included on the list, and must be provided an opportunity to consent to their inclusion, before being placed on the State list of eligible training providers and programs. The Governor must establish a mechanism for registered apprenticeship program sponsors in the State to be informed of their automatic eligibility and to indicate that the program sponsor wishes to be included on the State list of eligible training providers and programs. This mechanism must place minimal burden on registered apprenticeship program sponsors and must be developed in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship or with the assistance of the recognized State apprenticeship agency, as applicable.

      (b) Once on the State list of eligible training providers and programs, registered apprenticeship programs will remain on the list:

      (1) Until they are deregistered;

      (2) Until the registered apprenticeship program notifies the State that it no longer wants to be included on the list; or

      (3) Until the registered apprenticeship program is determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have substantially violated any provision of title I of WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 38.

      (c) A registered apprenticeship program whose eligibility is terminated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all youth, adult, and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance.

      (d) Inclusion of a registered apprenticeship in the State list of eligible training providers and programs allows an individual who is eligible to use WIOA title I, subtitle B funds to use those funds toward registered apprenticeship training, consistent with their availability and limitations as prescribed by § 680.300. The use of ITAs and other WIOA title I, subtitle B funds toward registered apprenticeship training is further described in § 680.330.

      (e) The Governor is encouraged to consult with the State and Local WDBs, ETA's Office of Apprenticeship, recognized State apprenticeship agencies (where they exist in the Governor's State) or other State agencies, to establish voluntary reporting of performance information.

      (f) Pre-apprenticeship providers that wish to provide training services to participants using WIOA title I, subtitle B funds are subject to the eligibility procedures of this subpart.

      § 680.480   May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?

#### § § 680.480

      (a) Yes. A training provider must meet the Governors requirements for eligibility and provide accurate information in order to retain its status as an eligible training provider.

      (b) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have substantially violated any provision of title I of WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 38, must be removed from the State list of eligible training providers and programs in accordance with the enforcement provisions of WIOA sec. 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under these conditions must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all youth, adult, and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures which individual or entity is responsible for making these determinations and the process by which the determination will be made, which must include an opportunity for a hearing that meets the requirements of § 683.630(b) of this chapter.

      (c) As a part of the biennial review of eligibility established by the Governor, the State must remove programs of training services that fail to meet criteria established by the Governor to remain eligible, which may include failure to meet established minimum performance levels. Registered apprenticeship programs only may be removed for the reasons set forth in § 680.470.

      (d) The Governor must establish an appeals procedure for providers of training services to appeal a denial of eligibility under this subpart that meets the requirements of § 683.630(b) of this chapter, which explains the appeals process for denial or termination of eligibility of a provider of training services.

      (e) Where a Local WDB has established higher minimum performance standards, according to § 680.430(e), the Local WDB may remove a program of training services from the eligible programs in that local area for failure to meet those higher performance standards. Training providers may appeal a denial of eligibility under § 683.630(b) of this chapter.

      (4) Information on the program completion rate for WIOA participants in § 680.460(g)(7).

      (c) Governors may require any additional performance information (such as the information described at WIOA sec. 122(b)(1)) that the Governor determines to be appropriate to determine, maintain eligibility, or better to inform consumers.

      (d) Governors must establish a procedure by which a provider can demonstrate that providing additional information required under this section would be unduly burdensome or costly. If the Governor determines that providers have demonstrated such extraordinary costs or undue burden:

      (1) The Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of the information;

      (2) The Governor may provide additional resources to assist providers in the collection of the information from funds for statewide workforce investment activities reserved under WIOA secs. 128(a) and 133(a)(1); or

      (3) The Governor may take other steps to assist eligible training providers in collecting and supplying required information such as offering technical assistance.

    Subpart E—Priority and Special Populations

      § 680.600   What priority must be given to low-income adults and public assistance recipients and individuals who are basic skills deficient served with adult funds under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 680.600

      (a) WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E) states that priority for individualized career services ( § 678.430(b) of this chapter) and training services funded with title I adult funds must be given to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(5)(B)) in the local area.

      (b) States and local areas must establish criteria by which the one-stop center will apply the priority under WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E). Such criteria may include the availability of other funds for providing employment and training-related services in the local area, the needs of the specific groups within the local area, and other appropriate factors.

      (c) The priority established under paragraph (a) of this section does not necessarily mean that these services only may be provided to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient. The Local WDB and the Governor may establish a process that also gives priority to other individuals eligible to receive such services, provided that it is consistent with priority of service for veterans ( § 680.650) and the priority provisions of WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E), discussed above in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      § 680.610   Does the statutory priority for use of adult funds also apply to dislocated worker funds?

#### § § 680.610

      No, the statutory priority only applies to adult funds and only applies to providing individualized career services, as described in § 680.150(b), and training services. Funds allocated for dislocated workers are not subject to this requirement.

      § 680.620   How does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program relate to the one-stop delivery system?

#### § § 680.620

      The local TANF program is a required partner in the one-stop delivery system. Part 678 of this chapter describes the roles of such partners in the one-stop delivery system and it applies to the TANF program. TANF serves individuals who also may be served by the WIOA programs and, through appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have access to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the TANF program in the one-stop delivery system. TANF participants, who are determined to be WIOA eligible, and who need occupational skills training may be referred through the one-stop delivery system to receive WIOA training, when TANF grant and other grant funds are not available to the individual in accordance with § 680.230(a). WIOA participants who also are determined TANF eligible may be referred to the TANF program for assistance.

      § 680.630   How does a displaced homemaker qualify for services under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 680.630

      (a) Individuals who meet the definitions of a “displaced homemaker” ( WIOA sec. 3(16)) qualify for career and training services with dislocated worker title I funds.

      (b) Displaced homemakers also may qualify for career and training services with adult funds under title I if the requirements of this part are met ( §§ 680.120 and 680.600).

      (c) Displaced homemakers also may be served in statewide employment and training projects conducted with reserve funds for innovative programs for displaced homemakers, as described in § 682.210(c) of this chapter.

      (d) The definition of displaced homemaker includes the dependent spouse of a member of the Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in sec. 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code) and whose family income is significantly reduced because of a deployment, a call or order to active duty under a provision of law referred to in sec. 101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United State Code, a permanent change of station, or the service-connected death or disability of the member.

      § 680.640   May an individual with a disability whose family does not meet income eligibility criteria under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act be eligible for priority as a low-income adult?

#### § § 680.640

      Yes, even if the family of an individual with a disability does not meet the income eligibility criteria, the individual with a disability is to be considered a low-income individual if the individual's own income:

      (a) Meets the income criteria established in WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi); or

      (b) Meets the income eligibility criteria for payments under any Federal, State or local public assistance program (see WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(i)).

      § 680.650   Do veterans receive priority of service under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 680.650

      Yes, veterans, as defined under WIOA sec. 3(63)(A) and 38 U.S.C. 101, receive priority of service in all Department of Labor-funded training programs under 38 U.S.C. 4215 and described in 20 CFR part 1010. A veteran still must meet each program's eligibility criteria to receive services under the respective employment and training program. For income-based eligibility determinations, amounts paid while on active duty or paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for vocational rehabilitation, disability payments, or related VA-funded programs are not to be considered as income, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4213 and § 683.230 of this chapter.

      § 680.660   Are separating military service members eligible for dislocated worker activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 680.660

      If the separating service member is separating from the Armed Forces with a discharge that is anything other than dishonorable, the separating service member qualifies for dislocated worker activities based on the following criteria:

      (a) The separating service member has received a notice of separation, a DD-214 from the Department of Defense, or other documentation showing a separation or imminent separation from the Armed Forces to satisfy the termination or layoff part of the dislocated worker eligibility criteria in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(i);

      (b) The separating service member qualifies for the dislocated worker eligibility criteria on eligibility for or exhaustion of unemployment compensation in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(ii)(I) or (II); and,

      (c) As a separating service member, the individual meets the dislocated worker eligibility criteria that the individual is unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation in WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(iii).

    Subpart F—Work-Based Training

      § 680.700   What are the requirements for on-the-job training?

#### § § 680.700

      (a) OJT is defined at WIOA sec. 3(44). OJT is provided under a contract with an employer or registered apprenticeship program sponsor in the public, private non-profit, or private sector. Through the OJT contract, occupational training is provided for the WIOA participant in exchange for the reimbursement, typically up to 50 percent of the wage rate of the participant, for the extraordinary costs of providing the training and supervision related to the training. In limited circumstances, as provided in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(h) and § 680.730, the reimbursement may be up to 75 percent of the wage rate of the participant.

      (b) OJT contracts under WIOA title I, must not be entered into with an employer who has received payments under previous contracts under WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of failing to provide OJT participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages and employment benefits (including health benefits) and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as other employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work.

      (c) An OJT contract must be limited to the period of time required for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, consideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's IEP.

      § 680.710   What are the requirements for on-the-job training contracts for employed workers?

#### § § 680.710

      OJT contracts may be written for eligible employed workers when:

      (b) Employers may be reimbursed up to 50 percent of the wage rate of an OJT participant, and up to 75 percent using the criteria in § 680.730, for the extraordinary costs of providing the training and additional supervision related to the OJT.

      (c) Employers are not required to document such extraordinary costs.

      § 680.730   Under what conditions may a Governor or Local Workforce Development Board raise the on-the-job training reimbursement rate up to 75 percent of the wage rate?

#### § § 680.730

      (a) The Governor may increase the reimbursement rate for OJT contracts funded through the statewide employment and training activities described in § 682.210 of this chapter up to 75 percent, and the Local WDB also may increase the reimbursement rate for OJT contracts described in § 680.320(a)(1) up to 75 percent, when taking into account the following factors:

      (1) The characteristics of the participants taking into consideration whether they are “individuals with barriers to employment,” as defined in WIOA sec. 3(24);

      (2) The size of the employer, with an emphasis on small businesses;

      (3) The quality of employer-provided training and advancement opportunities, for example if the OJT contract is for an in-demand occupation and will lead to an industry-recognized credential; and

      (4) Other factors the Governor or Local WDB may determine to be appropriate, which may include the number of employees participating, wage and benefit levels of the employees (both at present and after completion), and relation of the training to the competitiveness of the participant.

      (b) Governors or Local WDBs must document the factors used when deciding to increase the wage reimbursement levels above 50 percent up to 75 percent.

      § 680.740   How can on-the-job training funds be used to support placing participants into a registered apprenticeship program?

#### § § 680.740

      (a) OJT contracts may be entered into with registered apprenticeship program sponsors or participating employers in registered apprenticeship programs for the OJT portion of the registered apprenticeship program consistent with § 680.700. Depending on the length of the registered apprenticeship and State and local OJT policies, these funds may cover some or all of the registered apprenticeship training.

      (b) If the apprentice is unemployed at the time of participation, the OJT must be conducted as described in § 680.700. If the apprentice is employed at the time of participation, the OJT must be conducted as described in § 680.710.

      § 680.780   Who is an “incumbent worker” for purposes of statewide and local employment and training activities?

#### § § 680.780

      States and local areas must establish policies and definitions to determine which workers, or groups of workers, are eligible for incumbent worker services. To qualify as an incumbent worker, the incumbent worker needs to be employed, meet the Fair Labor Standards Act requirements for an employer-employee relationship, and have an established employment history with the employer for 6 months or more, with the following exception: In the event that the incumbent worker training is being provided to a cohort of employees, not every employee in the cohort must have an established employment history with the employer for 6 months or more as long as a majority of those employees being trained do meet the employment history requirement. An incumbent worker does not have to meet the eligibility requirements for career and training services for adults and dislocated workers under WIOA, unless they also are enrolled as a participant in the WIOA adult or dislocated worker program.

      § 680.790   What is incumbent worker training?

#### § § 680.790

      Incumbent worker training must satisfy the requirements in WIOA sec. 134(d)(4) and increase the competitiveness of the employee or employer. For purposes of WIOA sec. 134(d)(4)(B), incumbent worker training is training:

      (a) Designed to meet the special requirements of an employer (including a group of employers) to retain a skilled workforce or avert the need to lay off employees by assisting the workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain employment.

      (b) Conducted with a commitment by the employer to retain or avert the layoffs of the incumbent worker(s) trained.

#### § § 680.840

      No. Funds provided to employers for work-based training, as described in this subpart and in subpart A of this part, may not be used to directly or indirectly aid in the filling of a job opening which is vacant because the former occupant is on strike, or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or the filling of which is otherwise an issue in a labor dispute involving a work stoppage.

    Subpart G—Supportive Services

      § 680.900   What are supportive services for adults and dislocated workers?

#### § § 680.900

      Supportive services for adults and dislocated workers are defined at WIOA sec. 3(59) and secs. 134(d)(2) and (3). Local WDBs, in consultation with the one-stop partners and other community service providers, must develop a policy on supportive services that ensures resource and service coordination in the local area. The policy should address procedures for referral to such services, including how such services will be funded when they are not otherwise available from other sources. The provision of accurate information about the availability of supportive services in the local area, as well as referral to such activities, is one of the career services that must be available to adults and dislocated workers through the one-stop delivery system. (WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(ix) and § 678.430 of this chapter). Local WDBs must ensure that needs-related payments are made in a manner consistent with §§ 680.930, 680.940, 680.950, 680.960, and 680.970. Supportive services are services that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in activities authorized under WIOA sec. 134(c)(2) and (3).

      § 680.930   What are needs-related payments?

#### § § 680.930

      Needs-related payments provide financial assistance to participants for the purpose of enabling them to participate in training and are a supportive service authorized by WIOA sec. 134(d)(3). Unlike other supportive services, in order to qualify for needs-related payments a participant must be enrolled in training.

      § 680.940   What are the eligibility requirements for adults to receive needs-related payments?

#### § § 680.940

      Adults must:

      (a) Be unemployed;

    Subpart A—Standing Youth Committees

      § 681.100   What is a standing youth committee?

#### § § 681.100

      The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) eliminates the requirement for Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) to establish a youth council. However, the Department encourages Local WDBs to establish a standing committee to provide information and to assist with planning, operational, oversight, and other issues relating to the provision of services to youth. If the Local WDB does not designate a standing youth committee, it retains responsibility for all aspects of youth formula programs.

      § 681.110   Who is included on a standing youth committee?

#### § § 681.110

      (a) If a Local WDB decides to form a standing youth committee, the committee must include a member of the Local WDB, who chairs the committee, members of community-based organizations with a demonstrated record of success in serving eligible youth, and other individuals with appropriate expertise and experience who are not members of the Local WDB.

      (b) The committee must reflect the needs of the local area. The committee members appointed for their experience and expertise may bring their expertise to help the committee address the employment, training, education, human and supportive service needs of eligible youth including out-of-school youth (OSY). Members may represent agencies such as secondary and postsecondary education, training, health, disability, mental health, housing, public assistance, and justice, or be representatives of philanthropic or economic and community development organizations, and employers. The committee may also include parents, participants, and youth.

      (c) A Local WDB may designate an existing entity such as an effective youth council as the standing youth committee if it fulfills the requirements above in paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 681.120   What does a standing youth committee do?

#### § § 681.120

      Under the direction of the Local WDB, a standing youth committee may:

      (a) Recommend policy direction to the Local WDB for the design, development, and implementation of programs that benefit all youth;

      (b) Recommend the design of a comprehensive community workforce development system to ensure a full range of services and opportunities for all youth, including disconnected youth;

      (c) Recommend ways to leverage resources and coordinate services among schools, public programs, and community-based organizations serving youth;

      (d) Recommend ways to coordinate youth services and recommend eligible youth service providers;

      (e) Provide on-going leadership and support for continuous quality improvement for local youth programs;

      (f) Assist with planning, operational, and other issues relating to the provision of services to youth; and

      (g) If so delegated by the Local WDB after consultation with the chief elected official (CEO), oversee eligible youth providers, as well as other youth program oversight responsibilities.

    Subpart B—Eligibility for Youth Services

      § 681.200   Who is eligible for youth services?

#### § § 681.200

      Both in-school youth (ISY) and OSY are eligible for youth services.

      § 681.210   Who is an “out-of-school youth”?

#### § § 681.210

      An OSY is an individual who is:

      (a) Not attending any school (as defined under State law);

      (b) Not younger than age 16 or older than age 24 at time of enrollment. Because age eligibility is based on age at enrollment, participants may continue to receive services beyond the age of 24 once they are enrolled in the program; and

      (c) One or more of the following:

      (1) A school dropout;

      (2) A youth who is within the age of compulsory school attendance, but has not attended school for at least the most recent complete school year calendar quarter. School year calendar quarter is based on how a local school district defines its school year quarters. In cases where schools do not use quarters, local programs must use calendar year quarters;

      (3) A recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent who is a low-income individual and is either basic skills deficient or an English language learner;

      (4) An offender;

      (5) A homeless individual aged 16 to 24 who meets the criteria defined in sec. 41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e-2(6)), a homeless child or youth aged 16 to 24 who meets the criteria defined in sec. 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)) or a runaway;

      (6) An individual in foster care or who has aged out of the foster care system or who has attained 16 years of age and left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption, a child eligible for assistance under sec. 477 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677), or in an out-of-home placement;

      (7) An individual who is pregnant or parenting;

      (8) An individual with a disability; or

      (9) A low-income individual who requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment.

      § 681.220   Who is an “in-school youth”?

#### § § 681.220

      An ISY is an individual who is:

      (a) Attending school (as defined by State law), including secondary and postsecondary school;

      (b) Not younger than age 14 or (unless an individual with a disability who is attending school under State law) older than age 21 at time of enrollment. Because age eligibility is based on age at enrollment, participants may continue to receive services beyond the age of 21 once they are enrolled in the program;

      (c) A low-income individual; and

      (d) One or more of the following:

      (1) Basic skills deficient;

      (2) An English language learner;

      (3) An offender;

      (4) A homeless individual aged 14 to 21 who meets the criteria defined in sec. 41403(6) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e-2(6)), a homeless child or youth aged 14 to 21 who meets the criteria defined in sec. 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), or a runaway;

      (5) An individual in foster care or who has aged out of the foster care system or who has attained 16 years of age and left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption, a child eligible for assistance under sec. 477 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677), or in an out-of-home placement;

      (6) An individual who is pregnant or parenting;

      (7) An individual with a disability; or

      (8) An individual who requires additional assistance to complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment.

      § 681.230   What does “school” refer to in the “not attending or attending any school” in the out-of-school and in-school eligibility criteria?

#### § § 681.230

      In general, the applicable State law for secondary and postsecondary institutions defines “school.” However, for purposes of WIOA, the Department does not consider providers of adult education under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild programs, the Job Corps program, high school equivalency programs, or dropout re-engagement programs to be schools. Therefore, in all cases except the one provided below, WIOA youth programs may consider a youth to be an OSY for purposes of WIOA youth program eligibility if he or she attend adult education provided under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild, Job Corps, high school equivalency programs, or dropout re-engagement programs regardless of the funding source of those programs. Youth attending high school equivalency programs funded by the public K-12 school system who are classified by the school system as still enrolled in school are an exception; they are considered ISY.

      § 681.240   When do local youth programs verify dropout status?

#### § § 681.240

      Local WIOA youth programs must verify a youth's dropout status at the time of WIOA youth program enrollment. An individual who is out of school at the time of enrollment, and subsequently placed in any school, is an OSY for the purposes of the 75 percent expenditure requirement for OSY throughout his/her participation in the program.

      § 681.250   Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply to?

#### § § 681.250

      (a) For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either basic skills deficient or an English language learner, and youth who require additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment, must be low-income. All other OSY meeting OSY eligibility under § 681.210(c)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) are not required to be low-income.

      (b) All ISY must be low-income to meet the ISY eligibility criteria, except those that fall under the low-income exception.

      (c) WIOA allows a low-income exception where five percent of WIOA youth may be participants who ordinarily would be required to be low-income for eligibility purposes and meet all other eligibility criteria for WIOA youth except the low-income criteria. A program must calculate the five percent based on the percent of newly enrolled youth in the local area's WIOA youth program in a given program year who would ordinarily be required to meet the low-income criteria.

      (d) In addition to the criteria in the definition of “low-income individual” in WIOA sec. 3(36), a youth is low-income if he or she receives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751  or if he or she lives in a high poverty area.

      § 681.260   How does the Department define “high poverty area” for the purposes of the special regulation for low-income youth in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 681.260

      A youth who lives in a high poverty area is automatically considered to be a low-income individual. A high poverty area is a Census tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, an American Indian Reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), Alaska Native Village Statistical Area or Alaska Native Regional Corporation Area, Native Hawaiian Homeland Area, or other tribal land as defined by the Secretary in guidance or county that has a poverty rate of at least 25 percent as set every 5 years using American Community Survey 5-Year data.

      § 681.270   May a local program use eligibility for free or reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program as a substitute for the income eligibility criteria under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 681.270

      Yes, WIOA sec. 3(36) defines a low-income individual to include an individual who receives (or is eligible to receive) a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

      § 681.280   Is a youth with a disability eligible for youth services under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act if his or her family income exceeds the income eligibility criteria?

#### § § 681.280

      Yes, for an individual with a disability, income level for eligibility purposes is based on the individual's own income rather than his or her family's income. WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi) states that an individual with a disability whose own income meets the low-income definition in clause (ii) (income that does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income level), but who is a member of a family whose income exceeds this income requirement is eligible for youth services. Furthermore, only ISY with a disability must be low income. OSY with a disability are not required to be low-income.

      § 681.290   How does the Department define the “basic skills deficient” criterion in this part?

#### § § 681.290

      (a) As used in § 681.210(c)(3), a youth is “basic skills deficient” if he or she:

      (1) Have English reading, writing, or computing skills at or below the 8th grade level on a generally accepted standardized test; or

      (2) Are unable to compute or solve problems, or read, write, or speak English at a level necessary to function on the job, in the individual's family, or in society.

      (b) The State or Local WDB must establish its policy on paragraph (a)(2) of this section in its respective State or local plan.

      (c) In assessing basic skills, local programs must use assessment instruments that are valid and appropriate for the target population, and must provide reasonable accommodation in the assessment process, if necessary, for individuals with disabilities.

      § 681.300   How does the Department define the “requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment” criterion in this part for OSY?

#### § § 681.300

      Either the State or the local level may establish definitions and eligibility documentation requirements for the “requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment” criterion of § 681.210(c)(9). In cases where the State WDB establishes State policy on this criterion, the State WDB must include the definition in the State Plan. In cases where the State WDB does not establish a policy, the Local WDB must establish a policy in its local plan if using this criterion.

      § 681.310   How does the Department define the “requires additional assistance to complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment” criterion in this part for ISY?

#### § § 681.310

      (a) Either the State or the local level may establish definitions and eligibility documentation requirements for the “requires additional assistance to complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment” criterion of § 681.220(d)(8). In cases where the State WDB establishes State policy on this criterion, the State WDB must include the definition in the State Plan. In cases where the State WDB does not establish a policy, the Local WDB must establish a policy in its local plan if using this criterion.

      (b) In each local area, not more than five percent of the ISY newly enrolled in a given program year may be eligible based on the “requires additional assistance to complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment” criterion.

      § 681.320   Must youth participants enroll to participate in the youth program?

#### § § 681.320

      (a) Yes, to participate in youth programs, participants must enroll in the WIOA youth program.

      (b) In order to be a participant in the WIOA youth program, all of the following must occur:

      (1) An eligibility determination;

      (2) The provision of an objective assessment;

      (3) Development of an individual service strategy; and

      (4) Participation in any of the 14 WIOA youth program elements.

    Subpart C—Youth Program Design, Elements, and Parameters

      § 681.400   What is the process used to select eligible youth service providers?

#### § § 681.400

      (a) The grant recipient/fiscal agent has the option to provide directly some or all of the youth workforce investment activities.

      (b) However, as provided in WIOA sec. 123, if a Local WDB chooses to award grants or contracts to youth service providers to carry out some or all of the youth workforce investment activities, the Local WDB must award such grants or contracts on a competitive basis, subject to the exception explained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section:

      (1) The Local WDB must identify youth service providers based on criteria established in the State Plan (including such quality criteria established by the Governor for a training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential) and take into consideration the ability of the provider to meet performance accountability measures based on the primary indicators of performance for youth programs.

      (2) The Local WDB must procure the youth service providers in accordance with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, in addition to applicable State and local procurement laws.

      (3) If the Local WDB establishes a standing youth committee under § 681.100 it may assign the committee the function of selecting of grants or contracts.

      (4) Where the Local WDB determines there are an insufficient number of eligible youth providers in the local area, such as a rural area, the Local WDB may award grants or contracts on a sole source basis.

      § 681.410   Does the requirement that a State and local area expend at least 75 percent of youth funds to provide services to out-of-school youth apply to all youth funds?

#### § § 681.410

      Yes. The 75 percent requirement applies to both statewide youth activities funds and local youth funds with 2 exceptions.

      (a) Only statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. Funds spent on statewide youth activities that do not provide direct services to youth, such as most of the required statewide youth activities listed in WIOA sec. 129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. For example, administrative costs, monitoring, and technical assistance are not subject to OSY expenditure requirement; while funds spent on direct services to youth such as statewide demonstration projects, are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.

      (b) For a State that receives a small State minimum allotment under WIOA sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) for youth or WIOA sec. 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II) for adults, the State may submit a request to the Secretary to decrease the percentage to not less than 50 percent for a local area in the State, and the Secretary may approve such a request for that program year, if the State meets the following requirements:

      (1) After an analysis of the ISY and OSY populations in the local area, the State determines that the local area will be unable to use at least 75 percent of the local area WIOA youth funds to serve OSY due to a low number of OSY; and

      (2) The State submits to the Secretary, for the local area, a request including a proposed percentage decreased to not less than 50 percent to provide workforce investment activities for OSY.

      (c) In the exercise of discretion afforded by WIOA sec. 129(a)(4), the Secretary has determined that requests to decrease the percentage of funds used to provide youth workforce investment activities for OSY will not be granted to States that received 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the past year. Therefore, when the Secretary receives such a request from a State, the request will be denied.

      (d) For local area funds, the administrative costs of carrying out local workforce investment activities described in WIOA sec. 128(b)(4) are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. All other local area youth funds beyond the administrative costs are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.

      § 681.420   How must Local Workforce Development Boards design Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth programs?

#### § § 681.420

      (a) The design framework services of local youth programs must:

      (1) Provide for an objective assessment of each youth participant that meets the requirements of WIOA sec. 129(c)(1)(A), and includes a review of the academic and occupational skill levels, as well as the service needs and strengths, of each youth for the purpose of identifying appropriate services and career pathways for participants and informing the individual service strategy;

      (2) Develop, and update as needed, an individual service strategy based on the needs of each youth participant that is directly linked to one or more indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii), that identifies career pathways that include education and employment goals, that considers career planning and the results of the objective assessment and that prescribes achievement objectives and services for the participant; and

      (3) Provide case management of youth participants, including follow-up services.

      (b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth programs in the local area, and how the 14 program elements required in § 681.460 are to be made available within that framework.

      (c) Local WDBs must ensure appropriate links to entities that will foster the participation of eligible local area youth. Such links may include connections to:

      (1) Local area justice and law enforcement officials;

      (2) Local public housing authorities;

      (3) Local education agencies;

      (4) Local human service agencies;

      (5) WIOA title II adult education providers;

      (6) Local disability-serving agencies and providers and health and mental health providers;

      (7) Job Corps representatives; and

      (8) Representatives of other area youth initiatives, such as YouthBuild, and including those that serve homeless youth and other public and private youth initiatives.

      (d) Local WDBs must ensure that WIOA youth service providers meet the referral requirements in WIOA sec. 129(c)(3)(A) for all youth participants, including:

      (1) Providing these participants with information about the full array of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local WDBs or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners; and

      (2) Referring these participants to appropriate training and educational programs that have the capacity to serve them either on a sequential or concurrent basis.

      (e) If a youth applies for enrollment in a program of workforce investment activities and either does not meet the enrollment requirements for that program or cannot be served by that program, the eligible training provider of that program must ensure that the youth is referred for further assessment, if necessary, or referred to appropriate programs to meet the skills and training needs of the youth.

      (f) In order to meet the basic skills and training needs of applicants who do not meet the eligibility requirements of a particular program or who cannot be served by the program, each youth provider must ensure that these youth are referred:

      (1) For further assessment, as necessary; and

      (2) To appropriate programs, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (g) Local WDBs must ensure that parents, youth participants, and other members of the community with experience relating to youth programs are involved in both the design and implementation of its youth programs.

      (h) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the individual service strategy required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program provider determines that it is appropriate to use a recent objective assessment or individual service strategy that was developed under another education or training program.

      (i) The Local WDBs may implement a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy for program elements described at § 681.460, for which the Local WDB may reserve and use not more than 10 percent of the total funds allocated to the local area under WIOA sec. 128(b). For additional regulations on WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategies, see § 683.500 of this chapter.

      § 681.430   May youth participate in both the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) youth and adult programs concurrently, and how do local program operators track concurrent enrollment in the WIOA youth and adult programs?

#### § § 681.430

      (a) Yes, individuals who meet the respective program eligibility requirements may participate in adult and youth programs concurrently. Such individuals must be eligible under the youth or adult eligibility criteria applicable to the services received. Local program operators may determine, for these individuals, the appropriate level and balance of services under the youth and adult programs.

      (b) Local program operators must identify and track the funding streams which pay the costs of services provided to individuals who are participating in youth and adult programs concurrently, and ensure no duplication of services.

      (c) Individuals who meet the respective program eligibility requirements for WIOA youth title I and title II may participate in title I youth and title II concurrently.

      § 681.440   How does a local youth program determine if an 18 to 24 year old is enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) youth program or the WIOA adult program?

#### § § 681.440

      A local program must determine the appropriate program for the participant based on the service needs of the participant and if the participant is career-ready based on an assessment of their occupational skills, prior work experience, employability, and the participant's needs.

      § 681.450   For how long must a local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act youth program serve a participant?

#### § § 681.450

      Local youth programs must provide service to a participant for the amount of time necessary to ensure successful preparation to enter postsecondary education and/or unsubsidized employment. While there is no minimum or maximum time a youth can participate in the WIOA youth program, programs must link participation to the individual service strategy and not the timing of youth service provider contracts or program years.

      § 681.460   What services must local programs offer to youth participants?

#### § § 681.460

      (a) Local programs must make each of the following 14 services available to youth participants:

      (1) Tutoring, study skills training, instruction and evidence-based dropout prevention and recovery strategies that lead to completion of the requirements for a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent (including a recognized certificate of attendance or similar document for individuals with disabilities) or for a recognized postsecondary credential;

      (2) Alternative secondary school services, or dropout recovery services, as appropriate;

      (3) Paid and unpaid work experiences that have academic and occupational education as a component of the work experience, which may include the following types of work experiences:

      (i) Summer employment opportunities and other employment opportunities available throughout the school year;

      (ii) Pre-apprenticeship programs;

      (iii) Internships and job shadowing; and

      (iv) On-the-job training opportunities;

      (4) Occupational skill training, which includes priority consideration for training programs that lead to recognized postsecondary credentials that align with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in the local area involved, if the Local WDB determines that the programs meet the quality criteria described in WIOA sec. 123;

      (5) Education offered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster;

      (6) Leadership development opportunities, including community service and peer-centered activities encouraging responsibility and other positive social and civic behaviors;

      (7) Supportive services, including the services listed in § 681.570;

      (8) Adult mentoring for a duration of at least 12 months, that may occur both during and after program participation;

      (9) Follow-up services for not less than 12 months after the completion of participation, as provided in § 681.580;

      (10) Comprehensive guidance and counseling, which may include drug and alcohol abuse counseling, as well as referrals to counseling, as appropriate to the needs of the individual youth;

      (11) Financial literacy education;

      (12) Entrepreneurial skills training;

      (13) Services that provide labor market and employment information about in-demand industry sectors or occupations available in the local area, such as career awareness, career counseling, and career exploration services; and

      (14) Activities that help youth prepare for and transition to postsecondary education and training.

      (b) Local programs have the discretion to determine what specific program services a youth participant receives, based on each participant's objective assessment and individual service strategy. Local programs are not required to provide every program service to each participant.

      (c) When available, the Department encourages local programs to partner with existing local, State, or national entities that can provide program element(s) at no cost to the local youth program.

      § 681.470   Does the Department require local programs to use Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds for each of the 14 program elements?

#### § § 681.470

      No. The Department does not require local programs to use WIOA youth funds for each of the program elements. Local programs may leverage partner resources to provide some of the readily available program elements. However, the local area must ensure that if a program element is not funded with WIOA title I youth funds, the local program has an agreement in place with a partner organization to ensure that the program element will be offered. The Local WDB must ensure that the program element is closely connected and coordinated with the WIOA youth program.

      § 681.480   What is a pre-apprenticeship program?

#### § § 681.480

      A pre-apprenticeship is a program designed to prepare individuals to enter and succeed in an apprenticeship program registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (commonly known as the “National Apprenticeship Act”; 50 Stat. 664, chapter 663; 29 U.S.C. 50 ) (referred to in this part as a “registered apprenticeship” or “registered apprenticeship program”) and includes the following elements:

      (a) Training and curriculum that aligns with the skill needs of employers in the economy of the State or region involved;

      (b) Access to educational and career counseling and other supportive services, directly or indirectly;

      (c) Hands-on, meaningful learning activities that are connected to education and training activities, such as exploring career options, and understanding how the skills acquired through coursework can be applied toward a future career;

      (d) Opportunities to attain at least one industry-recognized credential; and

      (e) A partnership with one or more registered apprenticeship programs that assists in placing individuals who complete the pre-apprenticeship program in a registered apprenticeship program.

      § 681.490   What is adult mentoring?

#### § § 681.490

      (a) Adult mentoring for youth must:

      (1) Last at least 12 months and may take place both during the program and following exit from the program;

      (2) Be a formal relationship between a youth participant and an adult mentor that includes structured activities where the mentor offers guidance, support, and encouragement to develop the competence and character of the mentee; and

      (3) While group mentoring activities and mentoring through electronic means are allowable as part of the mentoring activities, at a minimum, the local youth program must match the youth with an individual mentor with whom the youth interacts on a face-to-face basis.

      (b) Mentoring may include workplace mentoring where the local program matches a youth participant with an employer or employee of a company.

      § 681.500   What is financial literacy education?

#### § § 681.500

      The financial literacy education program element may include activities which:

      (a) Support the ability of participants to create budgets, initiate checking and savings accounts at banks, and make informed financial decisions;

      (b) Support participants in learning how to effectively manage spending, credit, and debt, including student loans, consumer credit, and credit cards;

      § 681.510   What is comprehensive guidance and counseling?

#### § § 681.510

      Comprehensive guidance and counseling provides individualized counseling to participants. This includes drug and alcohol abuse counseling, mental health counseling, and referral to partner programs, as appropriate. When referring participants to necessary counseling that cannot be provided by the local youth program or its service providers, the local youth program must coordinate with the organization it refers to in order to ensure continuity of service.

      § 681.520   What are leadership development opportunities?

      (h) Other leadership activities that place youth in a leadership role such as serving on youth leadership committees, such as a Standing Youth Committee.

      § 681.530   What are positive social and civic behaviors?

#### § § 681.530

      Positive social and civic behaviors are outcomes of leadership opportunities, which are incorporated by local programs as part of their menu of services. Positive social and civic behaviors focus on areas that may include the following:

      (a) Positive attitudinal development;

      (b) Self-esteem building;

      (c) Openness to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds;

      § 681.540   What is occupational skills training?

#### § § 681.540

      (a) The Department defines occupational skills training as an organized program of study that provides specific vocational skills that lead to proficiency in performing actual tasks and technical functions required by certain occupational fields at entry, intermediate, or advanced levels. Local areas must give priority consideration to training programs that lead to recognized postsecondary credentials that align with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in the local area. Such training must:

      (1) Be outcome-oriented and focused on an occupational goal specified in the individual service strategy;

      (2) Be of sufficient duration to impart the skills needed to meet the occupational goal; and

      (3) Lead to the attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential.

      (b) The chosen occupational skills training must meet the quality standards in WIOA sec. 123.

      § 681.550   Are Individual Training Accounts permitted for youth participants?

#### § § 681.550

      Yes. In order to enhance individual participant choice in their education and training plans and provide flexibility to service providers, the Department allows WIOA Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) for OSY, ages 16 to 24 using WIOA youth funds when appropriate.

      § 681.560   What is entrepreneurial skills training and how is it taught?

#### § § 681.560

      Entrepreneurial skills training provides the basics of starting and operating a small business.

      (a) Such training must develop the skills associated with entrepreneurship. Such skills may include, but are not limited to, the ability to:

      (1) Take initiative;

      (2) Creatively seek out and identify business opportunities;

      (3) Develop budgets and forecast resource needs;

      (4) Understand various options for acquiring capital and the trade-offs associated with each option; and

      (b) Approaches to teaching youth entrepreneurial skills include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (1) Entrepreneurship education that provides an introduction to the values and basics of starting and running a business. Entrepreneurship education programs often guide youth through the development of a business plan and also may include simulations of business start-up and operation.

      (2) Enterprise development which provides supports and services that incubate and help youth develop their own businesses. Enterprise development programs go beyond entrepreneurship education by helping youth access small loans or grants that are needed to begin business operation and by providing more individualized attention to the development of viable business ideas.

      (3) Experiential programs that provide youth with experience in the day-to-day operation of a business. These programs may involve the development of a youth-run business that young people participating in the program work in and manage. Or, they may facilitate placement in apprentice or internship positions with adult entrepreneurs in the community.

      § 681.570   What are supportive services for youth?

#### § § 681.570

      Supportive services for youth, as defined in WIOA sec. 3(59), are services that enable an individual to participate in WIOA activities. These services include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (a) Linkages to community services;

      (b) Assistance with transportation;

      (c) Assistance with child care and dependent care;

#### § § 681.580

      (a) Follow-up services are critical services provided following a youth's exit from the program to help ensure the youth is successful in employment and/or postsecondary education and training. Follow-up services may include regular contact with a youth participant's employer, including assistance in addressing work-related problems that arise.

      (b) Follow-up services for youth also may include the following program elements:

      (3) Financial literacy education;

      (4) Services that provide labor market and employment information about in-demand industry sectors or occupations available in the local area, such as career awareness, career counseling, and career exploration services; and

      (5) Activities that help youth prepare for and transition to postsecondary education and training.

      (c) All youth participants must be offered an opportunity to receive follow-up services that align with their individual service strategies. Furthermore, follow-up services must be provided to all participants for a minimum of 12 months unless the participant declines to receive follow-up services or the participant cannot be located or contacted. Follow-up services may be provided beyond 12 months at the State or Local WDB's discretion. The types of services provided and the duration of services must be determined based on the needs of the individual and therefore, the type and intensity of follow-up services may differ for each participant. Follow-up services must include more than only a contact attempted or made for securing documentation in order to report a performance outcome.

      § 681.590   What is the work experience priority and how will local youth programs track the work experience priority?

#### § § 681.590

      (a) Local youth programs must expend not less than 20 percent of the funds allocated to them to provide ISY and OSY with paid and unpaid work experiences that fall under the categories listed in § 681.460(a)(3) and further defined in § 681.600.

      (b) Local WIOA youth programs must track program funds spent on paid and unpaid work experiences, including wages and staff costs for the development and management of work experiences, and report such expenditures as part of the local WIOA youth financial reporting. The percentage of funds spent on work experience is calculated based on the total local area youth funds expended for work experience rather than calculated separately for ISY and OSY. Local area administrative costs are not subject to the 20 percent minimum work experience expenditure requirement.

      § 681.600   What are work experiences?

#### § § 681.600

      (a) Work experiences are a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience may take place in the private for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act or applicable State law, exists. Consistent with § 680.840 of this chapter, funds provided for work experiences may not be used to directly or indirectly aid in the filling of a job opening that is vacant because the former occupant is on strike, or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or the filling of which is otherwise an issue in a labor dispute involving a work stoppage. Work experiences provide the youth participant with opportunities for career exploration and skill development.

      (b) Work experiences must include academic and occupational education. The educational component may occur concurrently or sequentially with the work experience. Further academic and occupational education may occur inside or outside the work site.

      (c) The types of work experiences include the following categories:

      (1) Summer employment opportunities and other employment opportunities available throughout the school year;

      (2) Pre-apprenticeship programs;

      (3) Internships and job shadowing; and

      (4) On-the-job training (OJT) opportunities as defined in WIOA sec. 3(44) and in § 680.700 of this chapter.

      § 681.610   Does the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act require Local Workforce Development Boards to offer summer employment opportunities in the local youth program?

#### § § 681.610

      No, WIOA does not require Local WDBs to offer summer youth employment opportunities as summer employment is no longer its own program element under WIOA. However, WIOA does require Local WDBs to offer work experience opportunities using at least 20 percent of their funding, which may include summer employment.

      § 681.620   How are summer employment opportunities administered?

#### § § 681.620

      Summer employment opportunities are a component of the work experience program element. If youth service providers administer the work experience program element, they must be selected by the Local WDB according to the requirements of WIOA sec. 123 and § 681.400, based on criteria contained in the State Plan. However, the summer employment administrator does not need to select the employers who are providing the employment opportunities through a competitive process.

      § 681.630   What does education offered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster mean?

#### § § 681.630

      This program element reflects an integrated education and training model and describes how workforce preparation activities, basic academic skills, and hands-on occupational skills training are to be taught within the same time frame and connected to training in a specific occupation, occupational cluster, or career pathway.

      § 681.640   Are incentive payments to youth participants permitted?

#### § § 681.640

      Yes, incentive payments to youth participants are permitted for recognition and achievement directly tied to training activities and work experiences. The local program must have written policies and procedures in place governing the award of incentives and must ensure that such incentive payments are:

      (a) Tied to the goals of the specific program;

      (b) Outlined in writing before the commencement of the program that may provide incentive payments;

      (c) Align with the local program's organizational policies; and

      (d) Are in accordance with the requirements contained in 2 CFR part 200.

      § 681.650   How can parents, youth, and other members of the community get involved in the design and implementation of local youth programs?

#### § § 681.650

      Local WDBs and programs must provide opportunities for parents, participants, and other members of the community with experience working with youth to be involved in the design and implementation of youth programs. Parents, youth participants, and other members of the community can get involved in a number of ways, including serving on youth standing committees, if they exist and they are appointed by the Local WDB. They also can get involved by serving as mentors, serving as tutors, and providing input into the design and implementation of other program design elements. Local WDBs also must make opportunities available to successful participants to volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors, or in other activities.

    Subpart D—One-Stop Services to Youth

      § 681.700   What is the connection between the youth program and the one-stop delivery system?

#### § § 681.700

      (a) WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(i) requires that the youth program function as a required one-stop partner and fulfill the roles and responsibilities of a one-stop partner described in WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(A).

      (b) In addition to the provisions of part 678 of this chapter, connections between the youth program and the one-stop delivery system may include those that facilitate:

      (1) The coordination and provision of youth activities;

      (2) Linkages to the job market and employers;

      (3) Access for eligible youth to the information and services required in § 681.460;

      (4) Services for non-eligible youth such as basic labor exchange services, other self-service activities such as job searches, career exploration, use of one-stop center resources, and referral as appropriate; and

      (5) Other activities described in WIOA sec. 129(b)-(c).

      (c) Local WDBs must either colocate WIOA youth program staff at one-stop centers and/or ensure one-stop centers and staff are trained to serve youth and equipped to advise youth to increase youth access to services and connect youth to the program that best aligns with their needs.

      § 681.710   Do Local Workforce Development Boards have the flexibility to offer services to area youth who are not eligible under the youth program through the one-stop centers?

#### § § 681.710

      Yes. However, Local WDBs must ensure one-stop centers fund services for non-eligible youth through programs authorized to provide services to such youth. For example, one-stop centers may provide basic labor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act to any youth.

      (b) The Department's annual fiscal year appropriation provides funding for programs and activities described in paragraph (a) of this section under separate appropriations with various periods of availability. These periods of availability are described in § 683.100 as a program year. A program year for funds allocated under secs. 133(b)(2)(A) and 133(b)(2)(B) of WIOA begins on July 1 in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made and ends on June 30 of the following year. A program year for funds available under WIOA sec. 128(b)(2) is available from April 1 of the fiscal year in which the appropriation is made and ends on June 30 of the following year. Therefore, when grantees are calculating the minimum funding percentage they must do so on a program year basis.

      (c) When a new local area is designated under sec. 106 of WIOA the State must develop a methodology to apply the minimum funding provision specified in paragraph (a) of this section to local area allocations of WIOA youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds.

      (d) Amounts necessary to increase allocations to local areas to comply with paragraph (a) of this section must be obtained by ratably reducing the allocations to be made to other local areas.

      (e) If the amounts of WIOA funds appropriated in a fiscal year are not sufficient to provide the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section to all local areas, the amounts allocated to each local area must be ratably reduced.

      § 683.130   Does a Local Workforce Development Board have the authority to transfer funds between the adult employment and training activities allocation and the dislocated worker employment and training activities allocation?

#### § § 683.130

      (a) A Local WDB may transfer up to 100 percent of a program year allocation for adult employment and training activities, and up to 100 percent of a program year allocation for dislocated worker employment and training activities between the two programs.

      (b) Local WDBs may not transfer funds to or from the youth program.

      (c) Before making any transfer described in paragraph (a) of this section, a Local WDB must obtain the Governor's written approval. The Governor's written approval must be based on criteria or factors that the Governor must establish in a written policy, such as the State Unified or Combined Plan or other written policy.

      § 683.135   What reallotment procedures does the Secretary use?

#### § § 683.135

      (a) The Secretary determines, during the second quarter of each program year, whether a State has obligated its required level of at least 80 percent of the funds allotted under secs. 127 and 132 of WIOA for programs serving youth, adults, and dislocated workers for the prior program year, as separately determined for each of the three funding streams. The amount to be recaptured from each State for reallotment, if any, is based on State obligations of the funds allotted to each State under secs. 127 and 132 of WIOA for programs serving youth, adults, or dislocated workers, less any amount reserved (up to five percent at the State level) for the costs of administration. The recapture amount, if any, is separately determined for each funding stream.

      (b) The Secretary reallots youth, adult and dislocated worker funds among eligible States in accordance with the provisions of secs. 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA, respectively. To be eligible to receive a reallotment of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds under the reallotment procedures, a State must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allotment, less any amount reserved for the costs of administration at the State level of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds. A State's eligibility to receive a reallotment is separately determined for each funding stream.

      (c) The term “obligation” is defined at 2 CFR 200.71.

      (d) Obligations must be reported on the required Department of Labor (the Department) financial form, such as the ETA-9130 form, unless otherwise noted in guidance.

      § 683.140   What reallocation procedures must the Governors use?

#### § § 683.140

      (a) The Governor, after consultation with the State WDB, may reallocate youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds among local areas within the State in accordance with the provisions of secs. 128(c) and 133(c) of WIOA. If the Governor chooses to reallocate funds, the provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply.

      (b) For the youth, adult and dislocated worker programs, the amount to be recaptured from each local area for purposes of reallocation, if any, must be based on the amount by which the prior year's unobligated balance of allocated funds exceeds 20 percent of that year's allocation for the program, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration. Unobligated balances must be determined based on allocations adjusted for any allowable transfer between funding streams. The amount to be recaptured, if any, must be separately determined for each funding stream. The term “obligation” is defined at 2 CFR 200.71.

      (c) To be eligible to receive youth, adult or dislocated worker funds under the reallocation procedures, a local area must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allocation, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration, for youth, adult, or dislocated worker activities, as separately determined. A local area's eligibility to receive a reallocation must be separately determined for each funding stream.

      § 683.145   What merit review and risk assessment does the Department conduct for Federal financial assistance awards made under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I, subtitle D?

#### § § 683.145

      (a) For competitive awards, the Department will design and execute a merit review process for applications as prescribed under 2 CFR 200.204 when issuing Federal financial assistance awards made under WIOA title I, subtitle D. This process will be described in the applicable funding opportunity announcement.

      (b) Prior to issuing a Federal financial assistance award under WIOA title I, subtitle D, the Department will conduct a risk assessment to assess the organization's overall ability to administer Federal funds as required under 2 CFR 200.205. As part of this assessment, the Department may consider any information that has come to its attention and will consider the organization's history with regard to the management of other grants, including Department of Labor grants.

      (c) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Department will consider the following:

      (1) Financial stability;

      (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;

      (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards;

      (4) Reports and findings from audits; and

      (5) The applicant's ability to implement effectively statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities.

      (e) Consistent with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Department must make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

      (f) The grant recipient must account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal government in accordance with 2 CFR 200.310 through 200.316, and 200.329.

      (g) The Department should complete all closeout actions for Federal awards no later than 1 year after receipt and acceptance of all required final reports.

      (b)  (1) Recipients and subrecipients of a Federal award under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act must follow the cost principles at subpart E and appendices III through IX of 2 CFR part 200, including any exceptions identified by the Department at 2 CFR part 2900.

      (2) Unless specified in the grant agreement, for those items requiring prior approval in the Uniform Guidance ( selected items of cost, budget realignment), the authority to grant or deny approval is delegated to the Governor for programs funded under sec. 127 or 132 of WIOA or under the Wagner-Peyser Act.

      (3) Costs of workforce councils, advisory councils, Native American Employment and Training Councils, and Local WDB committees established under title I of WIOA are allowable.

      (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) through (6) of this section, all recipients and subrecipients of a Federal award under title I of WIOA and under the Wagner-Peyser Act must follow 2 CFR part 200, including any exceptions identified by the Department at 2 CFR part 2900.

      (2) Unless otherwise specified in the grant agreement, expenditures must be reported on accrual basis.

      (6) The addition method, described at 2 CFR 200.307, must be used for all program income earned under title I of WIOA and Wagner-Peyser Act grants. When the cost of generating program income has been charged to the program, the gross amount earned must be added to the program in which it was earned. However, the cost of generating program income must be subtracted from the amount earned to establish the net amount of program income available for use under the grants when these costs have not been charged to the program.

      (7) Any excess of revenue over costs incurred for services provided by a governmental or non-profit entity must be included in program income.

      (8) Interest income earned on funds received under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act must be included in program income.

      (a)  (1) As part of the 15 percent that a State may reserve for statewide activities, the State may spend up to 5 percent of the amount allotted under secs. 127(b)(1), 132(b)(1), and 132(b)(2) of WIOA for the administrative costs of statewide activities.

      (2) Local area expenditures for administrative purposes under WIOA formula grants are limited to no more than 10 percent of the amount allocated to the local area under secs. 128(b) and 133(b) of WIOA.

      (3) The 5 percent reserved for statewide administrative costs and the 10 percent reserved for local administrative costs may be used for administrative costs for any of the statewide youth workforce investment activities or statewide employment and training activities under secs. 127(b)(1), 128(b), 132(b), and 133(b) of WIOA.

      (4) In a one-stop environment, administrative costs borne by other sources of funds, such as the Wagner-Peyser Act, are not included in the administrative cost limit calculation. Each program's administrative activities are chargeable to its own grant and subject to its own administrative cost limitations.

      (5) Costs of negotiating a MOU or infrastructure funding agreement under title I of WIOA are excluded from the administrative cost limitations.

      (b)  Limits on administrative costs, if any, for programs operated under subtitle D of title I of WIOA will be identified in the grant or cooperative agreement.

      (b)  An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor depending on the substance of its agreements with Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. Federal awards expended as a recipient or subrecipient are subject to audit requirements under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      (c)  The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. Subrecipient and contractor determinations made under 2 CFR 200.330 must be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services provided as a contractor.

      § 683.215   What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I functions and activities constitute the costs of administration subject to the administrative cost limitation?

      § 683.220   What are the internal controls requirements for recipients and subrecipients of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?

#### § § 683.220

      (a) Recipients and subrecipients of WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds must have an internal control structure and written policies in place that provide safeguards to protect personally identifiable information, records, contracts, grant funds, equipment, sensitive information, tangible items, and other information that is readily or easily exchanged in the open market, or that the Department or the recipient or subrecipient considers to be sensitive, consistent with applicable Federal, State and local privacy and confidentiality laws. Internal controls also must include reasonable assurance that the entity is:

      (1) Managing the award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;

      (2) Complying with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal awards;

      (3) Evaluating and monitoring the recipient's and subrecipient's compliance with WIOA, regulations and the terms and conditions of Federal awards; and

      § 683.225   What requirements relate to the enforcement of the Military Selective Service Act?

#### § § 683.225

      The requirements relating to the enforcement of the Military Selective Service Act are found at WIOA sec. 189(h).

      § 683.230   Are there special rules that apply to veterans when income is a factor in eligibility determinations?

#### § § 683.230

      Yes, under 38 U.S.C. 4213, when past income is an eligibility determinant for Federal employment or training programs, any amounts received as military pay or allowances by any person who served on active duty, and certain other specified benefits must be disregarded for the veteran and for other individuals for whom those amounts would normally be applied in making an eligibility determination. This applies when determining if a person is a “low-income individual” for eligibility purposes (for example, in the WIOA youth, or NFJP programs). Also, it applies when income is used as a factor when a local area provides priority of service for “low-income individuals” with title I WIOA funds ( §§ 680.600 and 680.650 of this chapter). A veteran must still meet each program's eligibility criteria to receive services under the respective employment and training program.

#### § § 683.240

      (a)  Federal equity acquired in real property through grants to States awarded under title III of the Social Security Act or the Wagner-Peyser Act, including State Employment Security Agency (SESA) real property, is transferred to the States that used the grant to acquire such equity.

      (1) The portion of any real property that is attributable to the Federal equity transferred under this section must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act (Unemployment Compensation program), or the Wagner-Peyser Act.

      (2) When such real property is no longer needed for the activities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the States must request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer prior to disposition or sale of the property. The portion of the proceeds from the disposition of the real property that is attributable to the Federal equity transferred under this section must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act, or the Wagner-Peyser Act.

      (3) States must not use funds awarded under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act, or the Wagner-Peyser Act to amortize the costs of real property that is purchased by any State on or after February 15, 2007, the date of enactment of the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007.

      (4) Properties occupied by the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service must be colocated with one-stop centers.

      (b)  Properties with Reed Act equity may be used for the one-stop service delivery system to the extent that the proportionate share of Reed Act equity is less than or equal to the proportionate share of occupancy by the Unemployment Compensation and Wagner-Peyser Act programs in such properties. When such real property is no longer needed for authorized purposes, the State must request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer prior to disposition or sale. The portion of the proceeds from the disposition or sale of the real property that is attributable to the Reed Act equity must be returned to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and used in accordance with Department-issued guidance.

      (c)  Real property that was purchased with WIA funds or that was transferred to WIA now is transferred to the WIOA title I programs and must be used for WIOA purposes. When such real property is no longer needed for the activities of WIOA, the recipient or subrecipient must seek instructions from the Grant Officer or State (in the case of a subrecipient) prior to disposition or sale.

      § 683.245   Are employment generating activities, or similar activities, allowable under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 683.245

      (a) Under sec. 181(e) of WIOA, title I funds must not be spent on employment generating activities, investment in revolving loan funds, capitalization of businesses, investment in contract bidding resource centers, economic development activities, or similar activities, unless they are directly related to training for eligible individuals. For purposes of this prohibition, employer outreach and job development activities are directly related to training for eligible individuals.

      (b) These employer outreach and job development activities may include:

      (1) Contacts with potential employers for the purpose of placement of WIOA participants;

      (i) A State or direct grant recipient must utilize the written monitoring and audit resolution, debt collection and appeal procedures that it uses for other Federal grant programs.

      (ii) If a State or direct grant recipient does not have such written procedures, it must prescribe standards and procedures to be used for this grant program.

      (2) For subrecipients awarded funds through a recipient of grant funds under subtitle D of title I of WIOA, the direct recipient of the grant funds must have written monitoring and resolution procedures in place that are consistent with 2 CFR part 200.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary is responsible for resolving findings that arise from Federal audits, monitoring reviews, investigations, incident reports, and audits under 2 CFR part 200 for direct recipients of Federal awards under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III.

      (2) The Secretary will use the Department audit resolution process, consistent with 2 CFR part 200 (and Department modifications at 2 CFR part 2900), and Grant Officer Resolution provisions of § 683.440, as appropriate.

      (3) A final determination issued by a Grant Officer under this process may be appealed to the Department of Labor Office of Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at § 683.800.

      (c)  Findings arising from investigations or reviews conducted under nondiscrimination laws will be resolved in accordance with WIOA sec. 188 of WIOA and the Department of Labor nondiscrimination regulations implementing sec. 188 of WIOA, codified at 29 CFR part 38.

      § 683.430   How does the Secretary resolve investigative and monitoring findings?

#### § § 683.430

      (a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit, other monitoring, or an audit ( Single Audit, OIG Audit, GAO Audit, or other audit), the Secretary will notify the direct recipient of the Federal award of the findings of the investigation and give the direct recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take appropriate corrective actions.

      (1)  The Grant Officer in conjunction with the Federal project officer, reviews the complete file of the monitoring review, monitoring report, or final audit report and the recipient's response and actions under paragraph (a) of this section. The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of secs. 184(b)-(c) of WIOA. If the Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of the situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient. This notification constitutes final agency action.

      (2)  If the direct recipient's response and actions to resolve the findings are found to be inadequate, the Grant Officer will begin the Grant Officer resolution process under § 683.440.

      (b) Audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be resolved through the Grant Officer resolution process, as discussed in § 683.440.

      (a)  When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the a recipient's disposition of an audit or other resolution of findings (including those arising out of site visits, incident reports or compliance reviews), or with the recipient's response to findings resulting from investigations or monitoring reports, the initial and final determination process as set forth in this section is used to resolve the matter.

      (b)  The Grant Officer makes an initial determination on the findings for both those matters where there is agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's resolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of WIOA, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and applicable regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants or other agreements under the award.

      (c)  Except in an emergency situation, when the Secretary invokes the authority described in sec. 184(e) of WIOA, the Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, nor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments to resolve informally those matters in dispute contained in the initial determination. The initial determination must provide for an informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial determination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant Officer must issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which notifies the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the file.

      (d)  (1) Upon completion of the informal resolution process, the Grant Officer provides each party with a written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested. For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients which receive WIOA funds directly from the Department, ordinarily, the final determination is issued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved audit report to the Employment and Training Administration.

      § 683.500   What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategy?

#### § § 683.500

      (a) A WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is a specific type of performance-based contract strategy that has four distinct characteristics:

      (1) It is a strategy to use WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts as they are described in § 683.510;

      (2) It must include the identification of the workforce development problem and target populations for which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy; the outcomes the local area would hope to achieve through a Pay-for-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; and the acceptable cost to government associated with achieving these outcomes;

      (3) It must include a strategy for independently validating the performance outcomes achieved under each contract within the strategy prior to payment occurring; and

      (4) It must include a description of how the State or local area will reallocate funds to other activities under the contract strategy in the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract.

      (b) Prior to the implementation of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy, a local area must conduct a feasibility study to determine whether the intervention is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy.

      (c) The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy must be developed in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary.

      (b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain debt collection actions against a subrecipient when:

      (1) The subrecipient meets the criteria set forth in WIOA sec. 184(d)(2);

      (2) The misexpenditure of funds:

      (i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received WIOA funds from that subrecipient;

      (ii) Was not a violation of WIOA sec. 184(d)(1), did not constitute fraud, or failure to disclose, in a timely manner, all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award; or

      (iii) If fraud did exist:

      (A) It was perpetrated against the subrecipient;

      (B) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and cooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and

      (C) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented that further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile;

      (3) A determination which disallows the misexpenditure and establishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate level; and,

      (4) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the recipient would be either inappropriate or futile.

      § 683.750   What procedure must be used for administering the offset/deduction provisions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 683.750

      (a)(1) For misexpenditures by direct recipients of title I and Wagner-Peyser Act formula funds the Grant Officer may determine that a debt, or a portion thereof, may be offset against amounts that are allotted to the recipient. Recipients must submit a written request for an offset to the Grant Officer. Generally, the Grant Officer will apply the offset against amounts that are available at the recipient level for administrative costs.

      (2) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the misexpenditures were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of WIOA and regulations, fraud, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure.

      (b) For subrecipient misexpenditures that were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of WIOA and regulations, fraud, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure, if the Grant Officer has required the State to repay or offset such amount, the State may deduct an amount equal to the misexpenditure from the subrecipient's allocation of the program year after the determination was made. Deductions are to be made from funds reserved for the administrative costs of the local programs involved, as appropriate.

      (c) If offset is granted, the debt will not be fully satisfied until the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to the recipient by the amount of the misexpenditure.

      (d) For recipients of funds under title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds, a direct recipient may not make a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section until the State has taken appropriate corrective action to ensure full compliance within the local area with regard to appropriate expenditure of WIOA funds.

    Subpart H—Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review

      § 683.800   What actions of the Department may be appealed to the Office of Administrative Law Judges?

#### § § 683.800

      (a) An applicant for financial assistance under title I of WIOA who is dissatisfied by a determination not to award Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to such applicant; or a recipient, subrecipient, or a contractor against which the Grant Officer has directly imposed a sanction or corrective action under sec. 184 of WIOA, including a sanction against a State under part 677 of this chapter, may appeal to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) within 21 days of receipt of the final determination.

      (b) Failure to request a hearing within 21 days of receipt of the final determination constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.

      (c) A request for a hearing under this subpart must specifically state those issues or findings in the final determination upon which review is requested. Issues or findings in the final determination not specified for review, or the entire final determination when no hearing has been requested within the 21 days, are considered resolved and not subject to further review. Only alleged violations of WIOA, its regulations, the grant or other agreement under WIOA raised in the final determination and the request for hearing are subject to review.

      (d) A request for a hearing must be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Department of Labor, in accordance with 29 CFR part 18, with one copy to the Departmental official who issued the determination.

      (e) The procedures in this subpart apply in the case of a complainant who has engaged in the alternative dispute resolution process set forth in § 683.840, if neither a settlement was reached nor a decision issued within the 60 days, except that the request for hearing before the OALJ must be filed within 15 days of the conclusion of the 60-day period provided in § 683.840. In addition to including the final determination upon which review is requested, the complainant must include a copy of any Stipulation of Facts and a brief summary of proceedings.

      § 683.810   What rules of procedure apply to hearings conducted under this subpart?

#### § § 683.810

      (a)  The rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the OALJ at subpart A of 29 CFR part 18, govern the conduct of hearings under this subpart. However, a request for hearing under this subpart is not considered a complaint to which the filing of an answer by the Department or a Department agency or official is required. Technical rules of evidence will not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part. However, rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to cross-examination will apply.

      (b)  In all cases, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) should encourage the use of prehearing procedures to simplify and clarify facts and issues.

      (c)  Subpoenas necessary to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents or other items at hearings must be obtained from the ALJ and must be issued under the authority contained in WIOA sec. 183(c), incorporating 15 U.S.C. 49.

      (d)  The ALJ must not permit the introduction at the hearing of any documentation if it has not been made available for review by the other parties to the proceeding either at the time ordered for any prehearing conference, or, in the absence of such an order, at least 3 weeks prior to the hearing date.

      (e)  The Grant Officer has the burden of production to support her or his decision. This burden is satisfied once the Grant Officer prepares and files an administrative file in support of the decision which must be made part of the record. Thereafter, the party or parties seeking to overturn the Grant Officer's decision has the burden of persuasion.

      § 683.820   What authority does the Administrative Law Judge have in ordering relief as an outcome of an administrative hearing?

#### § § 683.820

      (a) In ordering relief the ALJ has the full authority of the Secretary under WIOA, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) In grant selection appeals of awards funded under WIOA title I, subtitle D:

      (1) If the Administrative Law Judge rules, under § 683.800, that the appealing organization should have been selected for an award, the matter must be remanded to the Grant Officer. The Grant Officer must, within 10 working days, determine whether the organization continues to meet the requirements of the applicable solicitation, whether the funds which are the subject of the ALJ's decision will be awarded to the organization, and the timing of the award. In making this determination, the Grant Officer must take into account disruption to participants, disruption to grantees, and the operational needs of the program.

      (2) If the Administrative Law Judge rules that additional application review is required, the Grant Officer must implement that review and, if a new organization is selected, follow the steps laid out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine whether the grant funds will be awarded to that organization.

      (3) In the event that the Grant Officer determines that the funds will not be awarded to the appealing organization for the reasons discussed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an organization which does not have an approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement will be awarded its reasonable application preparation costs.

      (4) If funds are awarded to the appealing organization, the Grant Officer will notify the current grantee within 10 days. In addition, the appealing organization is not entitled to the full grant amount but only will receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been obligated by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and its subsequent closeout.

      (5) In the event that an organization, other than the appealing organization, is adversely effected by the Grant Officer's determination upon completion of the additional application review under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that organization may appeal that decision to the Office of Administrative Law Judges by following the procedures set forth in § 683.800.

      (6) Any organization selected and/or funded under WIOA title I, subtitle D, is subject to having its award removed if an ALJ decision so orders. As part of this process, the Grant Officer will provide instructions on transition and closeout to both the newly selected grantee and to the grantee whose position is affected or which is being removed. All awardees must agree to the provisions of this paragraph (b) as a condition of accepting a grant award.

      § 683.830   When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a decision?

#### § § 683.830

      (a) The ALJ should render a written decision not later than 90 days after the closing of the record.

      (b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 01-2020), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken, in accordance with 29 CFR part 26. Any exception not specifically raised in the petition is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review also must be sent to the opposing party and if an applicant or recipient, to the Grant Officer and the Grant Officer's Counsel at the time of filing. Unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, notifies the parties that the case has been accepted for review, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. In any case accepted by the ARB, a decision must be issued by the ARB within 180 days of acceptance. If a decision is not so issued, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.

> [81 FR 56410, Aug. 19, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 13030, Mar. 6, 2020; 85 FR 30616, May 20, 2020; 86 FR 1779, Jan. 11, 2021]

      § 683.840   Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law Judges hearing?

#### § § 683.840

      (a) The parties to a complaint which has been filed according to the requirements of § 683.800 may choose to waive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts and render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter for informal review.

      (b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ described in paragraph (a) of this section will automatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a written decision has not been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as a final decision of an Administrative Law Judge under WIOA sec. 186(b).

      § 683.850   Is there judicial review of a final order of the Secretary issued under WIOA?

#### § § 683.850

      (a) Any party to a proceeding which resulted in a Secretary's final order under WIOA sec. 186 in which the Secretary awards, declines to award, or only conditionally awards financial assistance or with respect to a corrective action or sanction imposed under WIOA sec. 184 may obtain a review in the United States Court of Appeals having jurisdiction over the applicant or recipient of funds involved, by filing a review petition within 30 days of the issuance of the Secretary's final order in accordance with WIOA sec. 187.

      (b) The court has jurisdiction to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the Secretary, in whole or in part.

      (c) No objection to the Secretary's order may be considered by the court unless the objection was specifically urged, in a timely manner, before the Secretary. The review is limited to questions of law, and the findings of fact of the Secretary are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

      (d) The judgment of the court is final, subject to certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court.

  PART 684—INDIAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS UNDER TITLE I OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT

### Part 684

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 134, 166, 189, 503, Public Law 113-128, 128 Stat. 1425 (Jul. 22, 2014).

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 56428, Aug. 19, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purposes and Policies

      § 684.100   What is the purpose of the programs established to serve Indians and Native Americans under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

#### § § 684.100

      (a) The purpose of WIOA Indian and Native American (INA) programs in sec. 166 is to support employment and training activities for INAs in order to:

      (1) Develop more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of such individuals;

      (2) Make such individuals more competitive in the workforce and to equip them with entrepreneurial skills necessary for successful self-employment; and

      (3) Promote the economic and social development of INA communities in accordance with the goals and values of such communities.

      (b) The principal means of accomplishing these purposes is to enable tribes and Native American organizations to provide employment and training services to INAs and their communities. Services should be provided in a culturally appropriate manner, consistent with the principles of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 ).

      § 684.110   How must Indian and Native American programs be administered?

#### § § 684.110

      (a) INA programs will be administered to maximize the Federal commitment to support the growth and development of INAs and their communities as determined by representatives of such communities.

      (b) In administering these programs, the Department will follow the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. 450a, as well as the Department of Labor's “American Indian and Alaska Native Policies.”

      (c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the trust responsibilities of the Federal government to Federally recognized tribes in any way.

      (d) The Department will administer INA programs through a single organizational unit and consistent with the requirements in sec. 166(i) of WIOA. The Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is designated as this single organizational unit as required by sec. 166(i)(1) of WIOA.

      (e) The Department will establish and maintain administrative procedures for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of INA employment and training programs authorized under this Act.

      § 684.120   What obligation does the Department have to consult with the Indian and Native American grantee community in developing rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for Indian and Native American programs?

#### § § 684.120

      The Department's primary consultation vehicle for INA programs is the Native American Employment and Training Council. In addition, the Department will consult with the INA program grantee community in developing policies for the INA programs, actively seeking and considering the views of INA program grantees prior to establishing INA program policies and regulations. The Department will follow the Department of Labor's tribal consultation policy and Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000.

      § 684.130   What definitions apply to terms used in this part?

#### § § 684.130

      In addition to the definitions found in secs. 3 and 166 of WIOA, and § 675.300 of this chapter, the following definitions apply:

      means an organization whose governing board is comprised of 51 percent or more of individuals who are Alaska Native as defined in secs. 3(b) and 3(r) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602(b), (r)).

      means the total amount of funds unobligated by a grantee at the end of a program year. If the amount of funds unobligated by a grantee at the end of a program year is more than 20 percent of the grantee's “total funds available” for that program year, such excess amount is considered “excess carry-in.”

      means the Division of Indian and Native American Programs within the Employment and Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor.

      means a body of representatives who are duly elected, appointed by duly elected officials, or selected according to traditional tribal means. A governing body must have the authority to provide services to and to enter into grants on behalf of the organization that selected or designated it.

      means a U.S. Department of Labor official authorized to obligate Federal funds.

      means a Census tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, an American Indian Reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area, Alaska Native Village Statistical Area, or Alaska Native Regional Corporation Area, Native Hawaiian Homeland Area or county where the poverty rate for the INA population is at least 25 percent of the total INA population of such area using the most recent ACS 5-Year data. Alternatively, high-poverty also can mean, a Census tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, an American Indian Reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area, Alaska Native Village Statistical Area, or Alaska Native Regional Corporation Area, Native Hawaiian Homeland Area or county where the poverty rate for the total population is at least 25 percent of such area using the most recent ACS 5-Year data. INA program grantees may use either definition when determining if a Census tract is a high-poverty area.

      means an entity which is formally selected under subpart B of this part to operate an INA program and which has a grant agreement.

      means an entity that is currently receiving a grant under sec. 166 of WIOA.

      means, for the purpose of this part, an individual that is an American Indian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native.

      means an organization whose governing board is comprised of 51 percent or more individuals who are members of one or more Federally recognized tribes. Incumbent grantees who were receiving INA funding as of October 18, 2016 and met the 51 percent threshold with the inclusion of members of “State recognized tribes” continue to be eligible for WIOA sec. 166 funds as an _Indian-Controlled Organization_, as long as they have been continuously funded under WIOA as recipients of INA program grantees since October 18, 2016. Tribal Colleges and Universities meet the definition of Indian-Controlled Organization for the purposes of this regulation.

      means an organization whose governing board is comprised of 51 percent or more individuals who are Native Hawaiian as defined in sec. 7207 of the Native Hawaiian Education Act (20 U.S.C. 7517).

      means all funds that a grantee had “available” at the beginning of a program year.

      means an individual who is working part-time but desires full-time employment, or who is working in employment not commensurate with the individual's demonstrated level of educational and/or skill achievement.

    Subpart B—Service Delivery Systems Applicable to Section 166 Programs

      § 684.200   What are the requirements to apply for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?

#### § § 684.200

      (a) To be eligible to apply for a WIOA, sec. 166 grant, an entity must have legal status as a government or as an agency of a government, private non-profit corporation, or a consortium whose members all qualify as one of these entities.

      (b) A new entity (which is not an incumbent grantee) must have a population within the designated geographic service area which would receive at least $100,000 under the funding formula found at § 684.270(b), including any amounts received for supplemental youth services under the funding formula at § 684.440(a).

      (c) Incumbent grantees which do not meet this dollar threshold and were receiving INA funding of less than $100,000 as of October 18, 2016 will be grandfathered into the program and are eligible to be awarded less than $100,000 so long as the grantees have continuously received less than $100,000 since October 18, 2016.

      (d) The Department will make an exception to the $100,000 minimum for applicants that apply for WIOA funding through Public Law 102-477, the Indian, Employment, Training, and Related Services demonstration program, if all resources to be consolidated under the Public Law 102-477 plan total at least $100,000, with at least $20,000 derived from sec. 166 funds. However, incumbent Public Law 102-477 grantees that were receiving INA funding of less than $20,000 as of October 18, 2016 will be grandfathered into the program and are eligible to be awarded less than $20,000 so long as the grantees have continuously received less than $20,000 since October 18, 2016.

      (e) To be eligible to apply as a consortium, each member of the consortium must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must:

      (1) Be in close proximity to one another, but may operate in more than one State;

      (2) Have an administrative unit legally authorized to run the program and to commit the other members to contracts, grants, and other legally-binding agreements; and

      (3) Be jointly and individually responsible for the actions and obligations of the consortium, including debts.

      (f) Entities eligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:

      (1) Federally recognized Indian tribes;

      (2) Tribal organizations, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b;

      (3) Alaska Native-controlled organizations;

      (4) Native Hawaiian-controlled organizations;

      (5) Indian-controlled organizations serving INAs; and

      (6) A consortium of eligible entities which meets the legal requirements for a consortium described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (g) State-recognized tribal organizations that meet the definition of an Indian-controlled organization are eligible to apply for WIOA sec. 166 grant funds. State-recognized tribes that do not meet this definition but were grantees under WIA as of July 1, 2015 will be grandfathered into WIOA as Indian-controlled organizations provided they meet the definition of Indian-controlled organization in § 684.130.

      § 684.210   What priority for awarding grants is given to eligible organizations?

#### § § 684.210

      (a) Federally recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or a consortium of such entities will have priority to receive grants under this part for those geographic service areas in which they have legal jurisdiction, such as an Indian reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Service Area (OTSA), or Alaska Native Village Service Area (ANVSA).

      (b) If the Department decides not to make an award to an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity that has legal jurisdiction over a service area, it will consult with such tribe or Alaska Native entity that has jurisdiction before selecting another entity to provide services for such areas.

      (c) The priority described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply to service areas outside the legal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity.

      § 684.220   What is the process for applying for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?

#### § § 684.220

      (a) Entities seeking a WIOA sec. 166 grant, including incumbent grantees, will be provided an opportunity to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant every 4 years through a competitive grant process.

      (b) As part of the competitive application process, applicants will be required to submit a 4-year plan as described at § 684.710. The requirement to submit a 4-year plan does not apply to entities that have been granted approval to transfer their WIOA funds to the Department of the Interior pursuant to Public Law 102-477.

      § 684.230   What appeal rights are available to entities that are denied a grant award?

#### § § 684.230

      Any entity that is denied a grant award for which it applied in whole or in part may appeal the denial to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges using the procedures at § 683.800 of this chapter or the alternative dispute resolution procedures at § 683.840 of this chapter. The Grant Officer will provide an entity whose request for a grant award was denied, in whole or in part, with a copy of the appeal procedures.

      § 684.240   Are there any other ways in which an entity may be awarded a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?

#### § § 684.240

      Yes. For areas that would otherwise go unserved, the Grant Officer may designate an entity, which has not submitted a competitive application, but which meets the qualifications for a grant award, to serve the particular geographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP will seek the views of INA leaders in the community that would otherwise go unserved before making the decision to designate the entity that would serve the community. DINAP will inform the Grant Officer of the INA leaders' views. The Grant Officer will accommodate views of INA leaders in such areas to the extent possible.

      § 684.250   Can an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award be terminated?

#### § § 684.250

      (a) Yes, the Grant Officer can terminate a grantee's award for cause, or the Secretary or another Department of Labor official confirmed by the Senate can terminate a grantee's award in emergency circumstances where termination is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program under sec. 184(e) of WIOA.

      (b) The Grant Officer may terminate a grantee's award for cause only if there is a substantial or persistent violation of the requirements in WIOA or the WIOA regulations. The grantee must be provided with written notice 60 days before termination, stating the specific reasons why termination is proposed. The appeal procedures at § 683.800 of this chapter apply.

      § 684.260   Does the Department have to award a grant for every part of the country?

#### § § 684.260

      No, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for a grant award in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, the Department will not award funds for that service area. The funds that otherwise would have been allocated to that area under § 684.270 will be distributed to other INA program grantees, or used for other program purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for TAT are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 684.270(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent grant award cycle, when and if a current grantee or other eligible entity applies for a grant award to serve that area.

      § 684.270   How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds allocated to Indian and Native American program grantees?

#### § § 684.270

      (a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this section and funds used for other program purposes under § 684.260, all funds available for WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive workforce investment services program at the beginning of a program year will be allocated to INA program grantees for the geographic service area(s) awarded to them through the grant competition.

      (b) Each INA program grantee will receive the sum of the funds calculated using the following formula:

      (1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of unemployed American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals in the grantee's geographic service area(s) compared to all such unemployed persons in the United States.

      (2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals in poverty in the grantee's geographic service area(s) as compared to all such persons in poverty in the United States.

      (3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas are provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

      (c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section, based upon criteria to be described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the Department may utilize a hold harmless factor to reduce the disruption in grantee services which would otherwise result from changes in funding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.

      (d) The Department may reallocate funds from one INA program grantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve its area for any reason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal (political) strife, failure to adhere to or meet grant terms and conditions, or lack of ability or interest. If a grantee has excess carry-in for a program year, the Department also may readjust the awards granted under the funding formula so that an amount that equals the previous program year's carry-in will be allocated to another INA program grantee(s).

      (e) The Department may reserve up to one percent of the funds appropriated under WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for any program year for TAT purposes. It will consult with the Native American Employment and Training Council in planning how the TAT funds will be used, designating activities to meet the unique needs of the INA communities served by the INA program. INA program grantees also will have access to resources available to other Department programs to the extent permitted under other law.

    Subpart C—Services to Customers

      (g) Under § 683.255 of this chapter, sectarian activities involving WIOA financial assistance or participants are limited in accordance with the provisions of sec. 188(a)(3) of WIOA.

      § 684.330   What is the role of Indian and Native American program grantees in the one-stop delivery system?

#### § § 684.330

      (a) In those local areas where an INA program grantee conducts field operations or provides substantial services, the INA program grantee is a required partner in the local one-stop delivery system and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with those provisions, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the INA program grantee and the Local Workforce Development Board (WDB) over the operation of the one-stop center(s) in the Local WDB's workforce development area also must be executed. Where the Local WDB is an alternative entity under § 679.150 of this chapter, the INA program grantee must negotiate with the alternative entity on the terms of its MOU and the scope of its on-going role in the local workforce development system, as specified in §§ 678.420 and 678.500 through 678.510 of this chapter. In local areas with a large concentration of potentially eligible INA participants, which are in an INA program grantee's service area but in which the grantee does not conduct operations or provide substantial services, the INA program grantee should encourage such individuals to participate in the one-stop delivery system in that area in order to receive WIOA services.

      (b) At a minimum, the MOU must contain the provisions listed in WIOA sec. 121(c) and:

      (1) The exchange of information on the services available and accessible through the one-stop delivery system and the INA program;

      (2) As necessary to provide referrals and case management services, the exchange of information on INA participants in the one-stop delivery system and the INA program; and

      (3) Arrangements for the funding of services provided by the one-stop(s), consistent with the requirements that no expenditures may be made with INA program funds for individuals who are not eligible or for services not authorized under this part.

      (c) Where the INA program grantee has failed to enter into a MOU with the Local WDB, the INA program grantee must describe in its 4-year plan the good-faith efforts made in order to negotiate an MOU with the Local WDB.

      (d) Pursuant to WIOA sec. 121(h)(2)(D)(iv), INA program grantees will not be subject to the funding of the one-stop infrastructure unless otherwise agreed upon in the MOU under subpart C of part 678 of this chapter.

      § 684.340   What policies govern payments to participants, including wages, training allowances or stipends, or direct payments for supportive services?

#### § § 684.340

      (a) INA program grantees may pay training allowances or stipends to participants for their successful participation in and completion of education or training services (except such allowance may not be provided to participants in OJT). Allowances or stipends may not exceed the Federal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher.

      (b) INA program grantees may not pay a participant in a training activity when the person fails to participate without good cause.

      (c) If a participant in a WIOA-funded activity, including participants in OJT, is involved in an employer-employee relationship, that participant must be paid wages and fringe benefits at the same rates as trainees or employees who have similar training, experience and skills and which are not less than the higher of the applicable Federal, State, or local minimum wage.

      (d) In accordance with the policy described in the 4-year plan submitted as part of the competitive process, INA program grantees may pay incentive bonuses to participants who meet or exceed individual employability or training goals established in writing in the individual employment plan.

      (e) INA program grantees must comply with other restrictions listed in WIOA secs. 181 through 195, which apply to all programs funded under title I of WIOA, including the provisions on labor standards in WIOA sec. 181(b).

      § 684.350   What will the Department do to strengthen the capacity of Indian and Native American program grantees to deliver effective services?

#### § § 684.350

      The Department will provide appropriate TAT, as necessary, to INA program grantees. This TAT will assist INA program grantees to improve program performance and improve the quality of services to the target population(s), as resources permit.

As indicated in § 684.710(c), additional planning information required for applicants requesting supplemental youth funding will be provided in the FOA. The Department envisions that the strategy for youth funds will not be extensive; however, grantees will be required to provide the number of youth it plans to serve and projected performance outcomes. The Department also supports youth activities that preserve INA culture and will support strategies that promote INA values.

      § 684.430   What individuals are eligible to receive supplemental youth services?

#### § § 684.430

      (a) Participants in supplemental youth services activities must be:

      (1) American Indian, Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian as determined by the INA program grantee according to § 684.300(a);

      (2) Between the age of 14 and 24; and

      (3) A low-income individual as defined at WIOA sec. 3(36) except up to five percent of the participants during a program year in an INA youth program may not be low-income individuals provided they meet the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

      (b) For the purpose of this section, the term “low-income,” used with respect to an individual, also includes a youth living in a high-poverty area.

      § 684.440   How is funding for supplemental youth services determined?

#### § § 684.440

      (a) Supplemental youth funding will be allocated to eligible INA program grantees on the basis of the relative number of INA youth between the ages of 14 and 24 living in poverty in the grantee's geographic service area compared to the number of INA youth between the ages of 14 and 24 living in poverty in all eligible geographic service areas. The Department reserves the right to redefine the supplemental youth funding stream in future program years, in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council, as program experience warrants and as appropriate data become available.

      (b) The data used to implement this formula are provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

      (c) The hold harmless factor described in § 684.270(c) also applies to supplemental youth services funding. This factor also will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.

      (d) The reallocation provisions of § 684.270(d) also apply to supplemental youth services funding.

      (e) Any supplemental youth services funds not allotted to a grantee or refused by a grantee may be used for the purposes outlined in § 684.270(e), as described in § 684.260. Any such funds are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 684.270(e).

      § 684.450   How will supplemental youth services be provided?

#### § § 684.450

      (a) INA program grantees may offer supplemental services to youth throughout the school year, during the summer vacation, and/or during other breaks during the school year at their discretion.

      (b) The Department encourages INA program grantees to work with local educational agencies to provide academic credit for youth activities whenever possible.

      (c) INA program grantees may provide participating youth with the activities referenced in § 684.310(e).

      § 684.460   What performance indicators are applicable to the supplemental youth services program?

#### § § 684.460

      (a) Pursuant to WIOA secs. 166(e)(5) and 166(h), the performance indicators at WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) apply to the INA youth program, which must include:

      (1) The percentage of program participants who are in education or training activities, or in unsubsidized employment, during the second quarter after exit from the program;

INA program grantees must document in their 4-year plan that a system is in place to afford all members of the eligible population within the service area for which the grantee was designated an equitable opportunity to receive WIOA services and activities.

      (b) Nothing in this section restricts the ability of INA program grantees to target subgroups of the eligible population (for example, the disabled, substance abusers, TANF recipients, or similar categories), as outlined in an approved 4-year plan. However, it is unlawful to target services to subgroups on grounds prohibited by WIOA sec. 188 and 29 CFR part 38, including tribal affiliation (which is considered national origin). Outreach efforts, on the other hand, may be targeted to any subgroups.

    Subpart G—Section 166 Planning/Funding Process

      (c) The Secretary only will renew the agreement of an entity to operate a Job Corps center if the entity:

      (1) Has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;

      (2) Has adequate financial resources to perform the agreement;

      (3) Has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills; and

      (4) Is otherwise qualified and eligible under applicable laws and regulations, including that the contractor is not under suspension or debarred from eligibility for Federal contractors.

      (1) Has been ranked in the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers according to the rankings calculated under § 686.1060; and

      (2) Failed to achieve an average of 50 percent or higher of the expected level of performance established under § 686.1050 with respect to each of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA, listed in § 686.1010.

      (e)(1) Information will be considered to be available for a program year for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section if for each of the primary indicators of performance, all of the students included in the cohort being measured either began their participation under the current center operator or, if they began their participation under the previous center operator, were on center for at least 6 months under the current operator. If an operator assumes operation of a center that meets the criteria under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the first contractual option year will not be denied based on the application of paragraph (d) of this section provided that the operator otherwise meets the requirements for renewal described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

      (2) If complete information for any of the indicators of performance described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not available for either of the 2 program years described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will review partial program year data from the most recent program year for those indicators, if at least two quarters of data are available, when making the determination required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

    § 687.180   What are the allowable activities under National Dislocated Worker Grants?

#### § § 687.180

    (a) For Employment Recovery DWGs:

    (1) Employment and training assistance, including those activities authorized at secs. 134(c) through (d) and 170(b)(1) of WIOA. The services to be provided in a particular project are negotiated between the Department and the grantee, taking into account the needs of the target population covered by the grant, and may be changed through grant modifications, if necessary.

    (2) DWGs may provide for supportive services, including needs-related payments (subject to the restrictions in sec. 134(d)(3) of WIOA, where applicable, and the terms and conditions of the grant) to help workers who require such assistance to participate in the activities provided for in the grant. Generally, the terms of a grant must be consistent with local policies governing such financial assistance under its formula funds (including the payment levels and duration of payments). The terms of the grant agreement may diverge from established local policies, in the following instances:

    (i) If unemployed dislocated workers served by the project are not able to meet the 13 or 8 weeks enrollment in training requirement established by sec. 134(d)(3)(B) of WIOA because of the lack of formula or DWG funds in the State or local area at the time of the dislocation, such individuals may be eligible for needs-related payments if they are enrolled in training by the end of the 6th week following the date of the DWG award; or

    (ii) Under other circumstances as specified in guidance governing DWG application requirements.

    (b) For Disaster DWGs: Funds provided under sec. 170(b)(1)(B) of WIOA can support a different array of activities, depending on the circumstances surrounding the situation for which the grant was awarded:

    (1) For DWGs serving individuals in an emergency or disaster area declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, disaster relief employment is authorized to support projects that provide food, clothing, shelter, and other humanitarian assistance for emergency and disaster victims, and projects regarding demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities, and lands located within the disaster area and in offshore areas related to the emergency or disaster in coordination with the Administrator of FEMA. Employment and training activities also may be provided, as appropriate. An individual's disaster relief employment is limited to 12 months or less for work related to recovery from a single emergency or disaster. The Secretary may extend an individual's disaster relief employment for up to an additional 12 months, if it is requested and sufficiently justified by an entity described in § 687.120(b).

    (2) For DWGs serving individuals who have relocated from an emergency or disaster area, only employment and training activities will be authorized, except where disaster relief employment is appropriate.

    (3) For DWGs awarded to States for events that have designations from Federal agencies (other than FEMA) that recognize an emergency or disaster situation as one of national significance that could result in a potentially large loss of employment, disaster relief employment and/or employment and training activities may be authorized, depending on the circumstances associated with the specific event.

    (c) Disaster Recovery DWG funds may be expended through public and private agencies and organizations engaged in the activities described in this paragraph (b) of this section.

    § 687.190   How do statutory and regulatory waivers apply to National Dislocated Worker Grants?

#### § § 687.190

    (a) For DWGs, utilization of statutory or regulatory waivers is limited to waivers already approved by the Department under sec. 189(i) of WIOA, separate from the DWG process. WIOA sec. 189(i) gives the Department the authority to waive provisions under subtitles A, B, and/or E of WIOA; requirements of DWGs in WIOA subtitle D cannot and will not be waived.

    (b) A grant application must include a description of the approved waiver and request that the waiver be applied to the DWG. The Department will consider such requests as part of the overall DWG application review and decision process; however, applicants may not use this process to request new waivers.

    (c) If during the operation of a DWG, the grantee wishes to utilize a statutory or regulatory waiver that the Department has already approved under sec. 189(i), but it was not included in the grantee's original DWG application, the grantee must submit a grant modification that describes the waiver and requests application of the waiver to the DWG. Grantees may not use this process to request new waivers.

    § 687.200   What are the program and administrative requirements that apply to National Dislocated Worker Grants?

#### § § 687.200

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized in a DWG agreement, the financial and administrative rules contained in part 683 of this chapter apply to awards under this part.

    (b) Exceptions include:

    (1) Funds provided in response to a disaster may be used for temporary job creation in areas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, and, in some instances, areas impacted by an emergency or disaster situation of national significance, as provided in § 687.110(b)(2), and subject to the limitations of sec. 170(d) of WIOA, this part, and any guidance issued by the Department;

    (2) Per sec. 170(d)(4) of WIOA, in extremely limited instances, as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, any Disaster Recovery DWG funds that are available for expenditure under any grant awarded under this part may be used for additional disasters or situations of national significance experienced by an entity described in § 687.120(b) in the same program year the funds were awarded;

    (3) DWG funds may be used to pay an appropriate level of administrative costs based on the design and complexity of the project. The Department will negotiate administrative costs with the applicant as part of the application review and grant award and modification processes. Administrative cost limits will be calculated against the amount of the grant awarded;

    (4) The period of availability for expenditure of funds under a DWG is specified in the grant agreement;

    (5) The Department may establish supplemental reporting, monitoring, and oversight requirements for DWGs. The requirements will be identified in the grant application instructions or the grant document; and

    (6) The Department may negotiate and fund projects under terms other than those specified in this part where it can be clearly demonstrated that such adjustments will achieve a greater positive benefit for the workers and/or communities being assisted.

      (a) YouthBuild is a workforce development program that provides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged and low-income youth between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom are secondary school drop outs and are either a member of a low-income family, a foster care youth, a youth who is homeless, an offender, a youth with a disability, a child of an incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.

      (b) Program participants receive education services that may lead to either a high school diploma or its State-recognized equivalent. Further, they receive occupational skills training and are encouraged to pursue postsecondary education or additional training, including registered apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The program is designed to create a skilled workforce either in the construction industry, through the rehabilitation and construction of housing for homeless and low-income individuals and families, as well as public facilities, or in other in-demand industries or occupations. The program also benefits the larger community because it provides increased access to affordable housing.

      § 688.110   What are the purposes of the YouthBuild program?

#### § § 688.110

      The overarching goal of the YouthBuild program is to provide disadvantaged and low-income youth the opportunity to obtain education and employment skills in local in-demand jobs to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, the YouthBuild program has as goals to:

      (a) Enable disadvantaged youth to obtain the education and employment skills necessary to achieve economic self-sufficiency through employment in in-demand occupations and pursuit of postsecondary education and training opportunities;

      (b) Provide disadvantaged youth with opportunities for meaningful work and service to their communities;

      (c) Foster the development of employment and leadership skills and commitment to community development among youth in low-income communities;

      (d) Expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for homeless individuals and families, homeless youth, and low-income families by utilizing the talents of disadvantaged youth. The program seeks to increase the number of affordable and transitional housing units available to decrease the rate of homelessness in communities with YouthBuild programs; and

      (e) Improve the quality and energy efficiency of community and other non-profit and public facilities, including those that are used to serve homeless and low-income families.
