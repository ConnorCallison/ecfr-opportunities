      § 401.220   Registration of Pilots.

#### § § 401.220

      (a) The Director must determine the number of Pilots required to be registered in order to assure adequate and efficient pilotage service in the United States waters of the Great Lakes and to provide for equitable participation of United States Registered Pilots with Canadian Registered Pilots in the rendering of pilotage services. The Director determines the number of Pilots needed as follows:

      (1) The Director determines the base number of Pilots needed by dividing each area's peak pilotage demand data by its pilot work cycle. The Pilot work cycle standard includes any time that the Director finds to be a necessary and reasonable component of ensuring that a pilotage assignment is carried out safely, efficiently, and reliably for each area. These components may include, but are not limited to—

      (i) Amount of time a Pilot provides pilotage service or is available to a vessel's Master to provide pilotage service;

      (ii) Pilot travel time, measured from the Pilot's base, to and from an assignment's starting and ending points;

      (iii) Assignment delays and detentions;

      (iv) Administrative time for a Pilot who serves as a pilot association's president;

      (v) Rest between assignments, as required by § 401.451;

      (vi) Ten days' recuperative rest per month from April 15 through November 15 each year, provided that lesser rest allowances are approved by the Director at the pilot association's request, if necessary to provide pilotage without interruption through that period; and

      (vii) Pilotage-related training.

      (2) Pilotage demand and the base seasonal work standard are based on available and reliable data, as so deemed by the Director, for a multi-year base period. The multi-year period is the 10 most recent past years, and the data source is a system approved under 46 CFR 403.300. Where such data are not available or reliable, the Director also may use data, from additional past years or other sources, that the Director determines to be available and reliable.

      (3) The number of Pilots needed in each district is calculated by totaling the area results by district and rounding them to the nearest whole integer. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make reasonable and necessary adjustments to the rounded result to provide for changes that the Director anticipates will affect the need for Pilots in the district over the period for which base rates are being established.

      (b) Registration of Pilots must be made from among those Apprentice Pilots who have:

      (1) Completed the minimum number of round trips prescribed by the Director over the waters for which application is made on oceangoing vessels, in company with a United States Registered Pilot or Temporary Registered Pilot, and in accordance with the Apprentice Pilot's approved individual training plan;

      (2) Completed the approved course of instruction for Apprentice Pilots prescribed by the association authorized to establish the pilotage pool; and

      (3) After completing the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, satisfactorily completed a written examination prescribed by the Director, evidencing their knowledge and understanding of the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations, Rules and Orders; the Memorandum of Understanding, Great Lakes Pilotage, between the United States and Canada; and other related matters including the working rules and operating procedures of the district, given at such time and place as the Director may designate within the pilotage district of the Apprentice Pilot.

      (c) The pilot association authorized to establish a pilotage pool in which an Apprentice Pilot has qualified for registration under paragraph (b) of this section must submit to the Director, in writing, its recommendations together with its reasons for or against the registration of the Apprentice Pilot.

      (d) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, an Apprentice Pilot found to be qualified under this subpart may be considered fully registered and issued a Certificate of Registration, valid for a term of five (5) years or until the expiration of their Master, Mate, or Pilot endorsement, or until the Pilot reaches age 70, whichever occurs first.

      § 401.230   Certificates of Registration.

#### § § 401.230

      (a) A Certificate of Registration must describe the areas and routes of the Great Lakes within which the Pilot is authorized to perform pilotage services, and such description must be consistent with the terms of the pilotage authorization in their Master, Mate, or Pilot endorsement issued under the authority of Title 46 of the United States Code.

      (b) A Certificate of Registration does not authorize the holder to board any vessel, or to serve as a Pilot of any vessel, without the permission of the owner or Master. A Certificate of Registration must be in the possession of a Pilot at all times when they are in the service of a vessel, and must be displayed upon demand of the owner or Master, any United States Coast Guard officer or inspector, or a representative of the Director.

      (c) A Certificate of Registration evidencing registration of the holder is the property of the U.S. Coast Guard, and it may not be pledged, deposited, or surrendered to any person except as authorized by this part. A Certificate of Registration may not be copied or digitally reproduced, or be used to make a facsimile or Photostat. A Certificate which has expired without renewal, or renewal of which has been denied under the provisions of this section, must be surrendered to the Director upon demand.

      (d) An application for a replacement of a lost, damaged, or defaced Certificate of Registration must be submitted to the Director, on a Form CG-4509, together with two full-face passport style photographs, signed on the photo, vertically, as close to the head as possible. A replacement fee of five dollars ($5) by check or money order, drawn to the order of the U.S. Coast Guard, must accompany any such application. A Certificate issued as a replacement for a lost, damaged, or defaced Certificate will be marked so as to indicate that it is a replacement. Upon receipt of a Certificate issued as a replacement, the damaged or defaced Certificate must be surrendered to the Director.

      (e) A Certificate of Registration may be voluntarily surrendered to the Director by a U.S. Registered Pilot at any time such Pilot no longer desires to perform pilotage services; however, in the event such U.S. Registered Pilot has been served with a notice of hearing pursuant to § 401.250, a voluntary surrender of the Certificate of Registration will be at the option of the Director.

      § 401.240   Renewal of Certificates of Registration.

#### § § 401.240

      (a) An application for renewal of a Certificate of Registration must be submitted to the Director, on a Form CG-4509, together with two full-face passport style photographs, signed on the photo, vertically, as close to the head as possible, at least 15 days before the expiration date of the existing Certificate. The form for renewal of Certificates of Registration may be obtained from the Director. A renewal fee of five dollars ($5) by check or money order, drawn to the order of the U.S. Coast Guard, must accompany an application for renewal of registration, which will be refunded if registration is not renewed. Failure of a U.S. Registered Pilot to comply with these requirements or file a complete and sufficient application may constitute cause for denying renewal of the Certificate of Registration.

      (b) No Certificate of Registration will be renewed unless the applicant for renewal meets the requirements and qualifications set forth in § 401.210 for issuance of an original Certificate of Registration, excepting that compliance with § 401.210(a)(4) is not required if the examination was satisfactorily passed on a previous application for registration within six (6) months next preceding the date of application for renewal.

      (c) If the Director determines that there is good cause for denying renewal of a Certificate of Registration, the applicant must be notified in writing of such determination and the cause thereof. The applicant may thereupon apply within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice for a hearing in regard to the cause for the denying of a renewal of the Certificate, which hearing must be granted.

      (d) In any case in which the applicant has made timely and sufficient application for renewal of their registration, no such registration will expire until such application has been finally determined by the Director unless the public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise.

      (e) Upon receipt of a renewal Certificate of Registration, the expired Certificate must be surrendered to the Director.

      § 401.510   Operation without Registered Pilots.

#### § § 401.510

      (a) A vessel may be navigated in the United States waters of the Great Lakes without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot when the vessel or its cargo is in distress or jeopardy.

      (b) A vessel may be navigated in the United States waters of the Great Lakes without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot only when the Director, with the concurrence of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District, notifies the Master that a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot is not available.

      (1) Notification to the Master that a Pilot is not available will be made by the Director, either directly to the vessel or through the appropriate pilotage pool, orally or in writing as the circumstances permit, and must not be deemed given until the notice is actually received by the vessel.

      (2) The determination that a Pilot is not available will be made on an individual basis and only when a vessel has given proper notice of its pilotage service requirements to the pilotage pool having dispatching jurisdiction at the time. The vessel has no obligation or responsibility with respect to such notification other than properly informing the pilotage pool of its pilotage requirements. However, the failure or delay by the pilotage pool in processing a pilotage service request, or refusal or delay by the Director in notifying the vessel that a Pilot is not available, does not constitute constructive notice that a Pilot is not available, and the vessel is not relieved by such failure or delay from compliance with the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960.

      (3) In the event of an emergency or any other compelling circumstance, the Director may issue, without the specific request for service as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, individual or general notification that a Pilot or Pilots are not available. Pilotage pools must advise the Director of any condition or circumstance coming to their attention which may warrant such a determination.

  PART 404—GREAT LAKES PILOTAGE RATEMAKING

### Part 404

**Authority:** Authority: 46 U.S.C. 2103, 2104(a), 9303, 9304; DHS Delegation 00170.1, Revision No. 01.2, paragraphs (II)(92)(a), (f).

**Source:** Source: USCG-2015-0497, 81 FR 11941, Mar. 7, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

    § 404.1   General ratemaking provisions.

#### § § 404.1

    (a) The goal of ratemaking is to promote safe, efficient, and reliable pilotage service on the Great Lakes, by generating for each pilotage association sufficient revenue to reimburse its necessary and reasonable operating expenses, fairly compensate trained and rested pilots, and provide an appropriate profit to use for improvements.

    (b) Annual reviews of pilotage association expenses and revenue will be conducted in conjunction with an independent party, and data from completed reviews will be used in ratemaking under this part.

    (c) Full ratemakings to establish multi-year base rates and interim year reviews and adjustments will be conducted in accordance with § 404.100 of this part.

    § 404.2   Procedure and criteria for recognizing association expenses.

#### § § 404.2

    (a) A pilotage association must report each expense item for which it seeks reimbursement through the charging of pilotage rates, and make supporting information available to the Director. The Director must recognize the item as both necessary for providing pilotage service, and reasonable as to its amount when compared to similar expenses paid by others in the maritime or other comparable industry, or when compared with Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The association will be given an opportunity to contest any preliminary determination that a reported item should not be recognized.

    (b) The Director applies the following criteria to recognize an expense item as necessary and reasonable within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section:

    (1)  Conformity to market rates, or in the absence of a comparable market, conformity to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment, computed as if the asset had been purchased with equity capital.

    (2)  A market equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the association by its members, if that investment is necessary for providing pilotage service.

    (3)  Revenues and expenses generated from these transactions are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed the expenses. If these transactions adversely affect providing pilotage services, the Director may make rate adjustments or take other steps to ensure pilotage service is provided.

    (4)  Association-paid benefits, including medical and pension benefits and profit sharing, are treated as pilot compensation.

    (5)  These association expenses are recognizable.

    (6)  These association expenses are recognizable except for any and all expenses associated with legal action against the U.S. Coast Guard or its agents in relation to the ratemaking and oversight requirements in 46 U.S.C. 9303, 9304 and 9305.

    (7)  The association's expenses for Apprentice Pilots and Apprentice Pilots with Limited Registrations, such as health care, travel expenses, training, and other expenses are recognizable when determined to be necessary and reasonable.

    (c) The Director does not recognize the following expense items as necessary and reasonable within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section:

    (1) Unreported or undocumented expenses, and expenses that are not reasonable in their amounts or not reasonably related to providing safe, efficient, and reliable pilotage service;

    (2) Revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots that are commingled with revenues and expenses from U.S. pilots;

    (3) Lobbying expenses; or

    (4) Expenses for personal matters.

    §§ 404.3-404.99   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 404.3-404.99

    § 404.100   Ratemaking and annual reviews in general.

#### § § 404.100

    (a) The Director establishes base pilotage rates by a full ratemaking pursuant to §§ 404.101 through 404.110, which is conducted at least once every 5 years and completed by March 1 of the first year for which the base rates will be in effect. Base rates will be set to meet the goal specified in § 404.1(a).

    (b) In the interim years preceding the next scheduled full rate review, the Director will adjust base pilotage rates by an interim ratemaking pursuant to §§ 404.101 through 404.110.

    (c) Each year, the Director will announce whether the Coast Guard will conduct a full ratemaking or interim ratemaking procedure.

> [USCG-2017-0903, 83 FR 26193, June 5, 2018]

    § 404.101   Ratemaking step 1: Recognize previous operating expenses.

#### § § 404.101

    The Director uses an independent third party to review each pilotage association's expenses, as reported and audited for the last full year for which figures are available, and determines which expense items to recognize for base ratemaking purposes in accordance with § 404.2 of this part.

    § 404.102   Ratemaking step 2: Project operating expenses, adjusting for inflation or deflation.

#### § § 404.102

    The Director projects the base year's non-compensation operating expenses for each pilotage association, using recognized operating expense items from § 404.101. Recognized operating expense items subject to inflation or deflation factors are adjusted for those factors based on the subsequent year's U.S. government consumer price index data for the Midwest, projected through the year in which the new base rates take effect, or if that is unavailable, the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation.

> [USCG-2017-0903, 83 FR 26193, June 5, 2018]

    § 404.103   Ratemaking step 3: Estimate number of registered pilots and apprentice pilots.

#### § § 404.103

    (a) The Director projects, based on the number of persons applying under 46 CFR part 401 to become U.S. Great Lakes registered pilots, and on information provided by the district's pilotage association, the number of pilots expected to be fully working and compensated.

    (b) The Director projects, based on the number of persons applying under 46 CFR part 401 to become Apprentice Pilots, traffic projections, information provided by the pilotage association regarding upcoming retirements, and any other relevant data, the number of Apprentice Pilots and Apprentice Pilots with Limited Registrations expected to be in training and compensated.

> [USCG-2017-0903, 83 FR 26193, June 5, 2018, as amended by USCG-2021-0431, 87 FR 18524, Mar. 30, 2022]

    § 404.104   Ratemaking step 4: Determine target pilot compensation benchmark and apprentice pilot wage benchmark.

#### § § 404.104

    (a) In a full ratemaking year, the Director determines base individual target pilot compensation using a compensation benchmark, set after considering the most relevant currently available non-proprietary information. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make necessary and reasonable adjustments to the benchmark.

    (b) In an interim year, the Director adjusts the previous year's individual target pilot compensation level by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for the Transportation and Materials sector, or if that is unavailable, the Director adjusts the previous year's individual target pilot compensation level using a two-step process:

    (1) First, the Director adjusts the previous year's individual target pilot compensation by the difference between the previous year's Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for the Transportation and Materials sector and the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation value used to inflate the previous year's target pilot compensation.

    (2) Second, the Director then adjusts that value by the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation for the upcoming year.

    (c) The Director determines each pilotage association's total target pilot compensation by multiplying individual target pilot compensation computed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by the number of pilots projected under § 404.103 or § 401.220(a) of this chapter, whichever is lower.

    (d) The Director determines the individual Apprentice Pilot wage benchmark at the rate of 36 percent of the individual target pilot compensation, as calculated according to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.

    (e) The Director determines each pilot association's total Apprentice Pilot wage benchmark by multiplying the Apprentice Pilot compensation computed in paragraph (d) of this section by the number of Apprentice Pilots and Apprentice Pilots with Limited Registrations projected under § 404.103(b).

> [USCG-2017-0903, 83 FR 26193, June 5, 2018, as amended by USCG-2018-0665, 84 FR 20578, May 10, 2019; USCG-2020-0457, 86 FR 14220, Mar. 12, 2021; USCG-2021-0431, 87 FR 18525, Mar. 30, 2022]

    § 404.105   Ratemaking step 5: Project working capital fund.

#### § § 404.105

    The Director calculates each pilotage association's allowed base working capital fund by adding the projected adjusted operating expenses from § 404.102 and the total target pilot compensation from § 404.104 of this part, multiplied by the preceding year's average annual rate of return for new issues of high grade corporate securities.

> [USCG-2015-0497, 81 FR 11941, Mar. 7, 2016, as amended by USCG-2016-0268, 82 FR 41496, Aug. 31, 2017; 82 FR 43864, Sept. 20, 2017]

    § 404.106   Ratemaking step 6: Project needed revenue.

#### § § 404.106

    The Director calculates each pilotage association's base projected needed revenue by adding the projected adjusted operating expenses from § 404.102 of this part, the total target pilot compensation from § 404.104 of this part, and the projected working capital fund from § 404.105 of this part.

> [USCG-2015-0497, 81 FR 11941, Mar. 7, 2016, as amended by USCG-2019-0736, 85 FR 20120, Apr. 9, 2020]

    § 404.107   Ratemaking step 7: Calculate initial base rates.

#### § § 404.107

    (a) The Director calculates initial base hourly rates by dividing the projected needed revenue from § 404.106 by averages of past hours worked in each district's designated and undesignated waters, using available and reliable data for a multi-year period set in accordance with § 401.220(a) of this chapter.

    (b) [Reserved]

> [USCG-2017-0903, 83 FR 26193, June 5, 2018]

    § 404.108   Ratemaking step 8: Calculate average weighting factors by Area.

#### § § 404.108

    The Director calculates the average weighting factor for each area by computing the 10-year rolling average of weighting factors applied in that area, beginning with the year 2014. If less than 10 years of data are available, the Director calculates the average weighting factor using data from each year beginning with 2014.

> [USCG-2016-0268, 82 FR 41496, Aug. 31, 2017]

    § 404.109   Ratemaking step 9: Calculate revised base rates.

#### § § 404.109

    The Director calculates revised base rates for each area by dividing the initial base rate (from Step 7) by the average weighting factor (from Step 8) to produce a revised base rate for each area.

> [USCG-2016-0268, 82 FR 41496, Aug. 31, 2017]

    § 404.110   Ratemaking step 10: Review and finalize rates.

#### § § 404.110

    The Director reviews the base pilotage rates calculated in § 404.109 of this part to ensure they meet the goal set in § 404.1(a) of this part, and either finalizes them or first makes necessary and reasonable adjustments to them based on requirements of Great Lakes pilotage agreements between the United States and Canada, or other supportable circumstances.
