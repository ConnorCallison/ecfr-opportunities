    Subpart B—NASA Information Security Program

      § 1203.200   Background and discussion.

#### § § 1203.200

      (a) In establishing a civilian space program, the Congress required NASA to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof,” and for the withholding from public inspection of that information that is classified to protect the national security.

      (b) The Order was promulgated in recognition of the essential requirement for an informed public concerning the activities of its Government, as well as the need to protect certain national security information from unauthorized disclosure. It delegates to NASA certain responsibility for matters pertaining to national security and confers on the Administrator of NASA, or such responsible officers or employees as the Administrator may designate, the authority for original classification of official information or material which requires protection in the interest of national security. It also provides for:

      (1) Basic classification, downgrading and declassification guidelines;

      (2) The issuance of directives prescribing the procedures to be followed in safeguarding classified information or material;

      (3) A monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of the Order;

      (4) Appropriate administrative sanctions against officers and employees of the United States Government who are found to be in violation of the Order or implementing directive; and

      (5) Classification limitations and restrictions as discussed in §§ 1203.410 and 1203.411.

      (c) The Order requires the timely identification and protection of that NASA information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the best interest of national security. Accordingly, the determination in each case must be based on a judgment as to whether disclosure of information could reasonably be expected to result in damage to the national security.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5889, Feb. 9, 1983; 78 FR 5117, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.201   Information security objectives.

#### § § 1203.201

      The objectives of the NASA Information Security Program are to:

      (a) Ensure that information is classified only when a sound basis exists for such classification and only for such period as is necessary.

      (b) Prevent both the unwarranted classification and the overclassification of NASA information.

      (c) Ensure the greatest practicable uniformity within NASA in the classification of information.

      (d) Ensure effective coordination and reasonable uniformity with other Government departments and agencies, particularly in areas where there is an exchange or sharing of information, techniques, hardware, software, or other technologies.

      (e) Provide a timely and effective means for downgrading or declassifying information when the circumstances necessitating the original classification change or no longer exist.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5117, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.203   Degree of protection.

#### § § 1203.203

      (a)  Upon determination that information or material must be classified, the degree of protection commensurate with the sensitivity of the information must be determined. If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within 30 days. If there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be safeguarded at the higher level of classification pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within 30 days.

      (b)  The three categories of classification, as authorized and defined in “the Order,” are set out below. No other restrictive markings are authorized to be placed on NASA classified documents or materials except as expressly provided by statute or by NASA Directives.

      (1)  Top Secret is the designation applied to information or material, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.

      (2)  Secret is the designation applied to information or material, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.

      (3)  Confidential is the designation applied to that information or material for which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.

    Subpart C—Classification Principles and Considerations

      § 1203.300   General.

#### § § 1203.300

      In general, the types of NASA-generated information and material requiring protection in the interest of national security lie in the areas of applied research, technology or operations.

      § 1203.301   Identification of information requiring protection.

#### § § 1203.301

      Classifiers shall identify the level of classification of each classified portion of a document (including subject and titles), and those portions that are not classified.

      § 1203.302   Compilation.

#### § § 1203.302

      A compilation of items that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that meets the standards of classification under the Order; and is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. As used in the Order, compilations mean an aggregate of pre-existing unclassified items of information.

> [78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.303   Distribution controls.

#### § § 1203.303

      NASA shall establish controls over the distribution of classified information to ensure that it is dispersed only to organizations or individuals eligible for access to such information and with a need-to-know the information.

> [78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.304   Internal effect.

#### § § 1203.304

      The effect of security protection on program progess and cost and on other functional activities of NASA should be considered. Impeditive effects and added costs inherent in a security classification must be assessed and weighed against the detrimental effects on the national security interests which would result from failure to classify.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.305   Restricted data.

#### § § 1203.305

      Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data is so classified when originated or by operation of the law, as required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Specific guidance for the classification of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data is provided in “Classification Guides” published by the Department of Energy and or Department of Defense.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

    Subpart D—Guides for Original Classification

      § 1203.400   Specific classifying guidance.

#### § § 1203.400

      Technological and operational information and material, and in some exceptional cases scientific information falling within any one or more of the following categories, must be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause some degree of damage to the national security. In cases where it is believed that a contrary course of action would better serve the national interests, the matter should be referred to the Chairperson, NISPC, for a determination. It is not intended that this list be exclusive; original classifiers are responsible for initially classifying any other type of information which, in their judgment, requires protection under § 1.4 of “the Order.”

      (a) Military plans, weapons systems, or operations;

      (b) Foreign government information;

      (c) Intelligence activities (including covert activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;

      (d) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;

      (e) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;

      (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;

      (g) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or

      (h) The development, production, or plans relating to the use of weapons of mass destruction.

> [78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.401   Effect of open publication.

#### § § 1203.401

      Public disclosure, regardless of source or form, of information currently classified or being considered for classification does not preclude initial or continued classification. However, such disclosure requires an immediate reevaluation to determine whether the information has been compromised to the extent that downgrading or declassification is indicated. Similar consideration must be given to related items of information in all programs, projects, or items incorporating or pertaining to the compromised items of information. In these cases, if a release were made or authorized by an official Government source, classification of clearly identified items may no longer be warranted. Questions as to the propriety of continued classification should be referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee.

      § 1203.402   Classifying material other than documentation.

#### § § 1203.402

      Items of equipment or other physical objects may be classified only where classified information may be derived by visual observation of internal or external appearance, structure, operation, test, application or use. The overall classification assigned to equipment or objects shall be at least as high as the highest classification of any of the items of information which may be revealed by the equipment or objects, but may be higher if the classifying authority determines that the sum of classified or unclassified information warrants such higher classification. In every instance where classification of an item of equipment or object is determined to be warranted, such determination must be based on a finding that there is at least one aspect of the item or object which requires protection. If mere knowledge of the existence of the equipment or object would compromise or nullify the reason or justification for its classification, the fact of its existence should be classified.

      § 1203.403   [Reserved]

#### § § 1203.403

      § 1203.404   Handling of unprocessed data.

#### § § 1203.404

      It is the usual practice to withhold the release of raw scientific data received from spacecraft until it can be calibrated, correlated and properly interpreted by the experimenter under the monitorship of the cognizant NASA office. During this process, the data are withheld through administrative measures, and it is not necessary to resort to security classification to prevent premature release. However, if at any time during the processing of raw data it becomes apparent that the results require protection under the criteria set forth in this subpart D, it is the responsibility of the cognizant NASA office to obtain the appropriate security classification.

      § 1203.405   Proprietary information.

#### § § 1203.405

      Proprietary information made available to NASA is subject to examination for classification purposes under the criteria set forth in this subpart D. Where the information is in the form of a proposal and accepted by NASA for support, it should be categorized in accordance with the criteria of § 1203.400. If NASA does not support the proposal but believes that security classification would be appropriate under the criteria of § 1203.400 if it were under Government jurisdiction, the contractor should be advised of the reasons why safeguarding would be appropriate, unless security considerations preclude release of the explanation to the contractor. NASA should identify the Government department, agency or activity whose national security interests might be involved and the contractor should be instructed to protect the proposal as though classified pending further advisory classification opinion by the Government activity whose interests are involved. If such a Government activity cannot be identified, the contractor should be advised that the proposal is not under NASA jurisdiction for classification purposes, and that the information should be sent, under proper safeguards, to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office for a determination.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.406   Additional classification factors.

#### § § 1203.406

      In determining the appropriate classification category, the following additional factors should be considered:

      (a)  The effect classification will have on technological programs of other Government departments and agencies should be considered. Classification of official information must be reasonably uniform within the Government.

      (b)  It is necessary to determine whether authoritative classification guidance exists elsewhere for the information under consideration which would make it necessary to assign a higher classification than that indicated by the applicable NASA guidance. The Office of Protective Services will coordinate with the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Committee and the National Declassification Center to determine what classification guides are current.

> [44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.407   Duration of classification.

#### § § 1203.407

      (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for declassification based on the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the date or event shall not exceed the timeframe established in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision.

      (c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this Order are followed.

      (d) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information that is marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, information marked as “Originating Agency's Determination Required,” or classified information that contains either incomplete or no declassification instructions, shall have appropriate declassification information applied in accordance with part 3 of this order.

      § 1203.410   Limitations.

#### § § 1203.410

      (a) In no case shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to:

      (1) Conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;

      (2) Prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;

      (3) Restrain competition; or

      (4) Prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.

      (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security may not be classified.

      (c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification after being released to the public under proper authority unless: The reclassification is based on a document-by-document review by NASA and a determination that reclassification is required to prevent at least significant damage to the national security and personally approved in writing by the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services. All reclassification actions will be coordinated with the Information Security Oversight Office before final approval; the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue public attention to the information; the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (the National Security Advisor) and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been available for public use, the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services, after making the determinations required by this paragraph, shall notify the Archivist of the United States (hereafter, Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval of the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the agency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public access shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal.

      (d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this Order only if such classification meets the requirements of this Order and is accomplished by document-by-document review with the personal participation or under the direction of the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services. The requirements in this paragraph also apply to those situations in which information has been declassified in accordance with a specific date or event determined by an original classification authority in accordance with section 1.5 of this Order.

      (e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that:

      (1) Meets the standards for classification under this Order; and

      (2) Is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.

      § 1203.412   Classification guides.

#### § § 1203.412

      (a)  A classification guide, based upon classification determinations made by appropriate program and classification authorities, shall be issued for each classified system, program or project. Classification guides shall:

      (1) Identify the information elements to be protected, using categorization and subcategorization to the extent necessary to ensure that the information involved can be readily and uniformly identified.

      (2) State which of the classification designations (i.e., Top Secret, Secret or Confidential) apply to the identified information elements.

      (3) State the duration of each specified classification in terms of a period of time or future event. If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision.

      (4) Indicate specifically that the designations, time limits, markings and other requirements of “the Order” are to be applied to information classified pursuant to the guide.

      (5) All security classification guides should be forwarded to the Office of Protective Services for review and final approval. The Office of Protective Services will maintain a list of all classification guides in current use.

      (b)  Classification guides shall be reviewed by the originator for currency and accuracy not less than once every five years. Changes shall be in strict conformance with the provisions of this part 1203 and shall be issued promptly. If no changes are made, the originator shall so annotate the record copy and show the date of the review.

    Subpart E—Derivative Classification

      § 1203.500   Use of derivative classification.

#### § § 1203.500

      (a) Persons who reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority.

      (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:

      (1) Be identified by name and position or by personal identifier, in a manner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification action;

      (2) Observe and respect original classification decisions; and

      (3) Carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:

      (i) The date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources or the marking established pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of the Order; and

      (ii) A listing of the source materials.

      (c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum when classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible or in unclassified form.

      (d) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall receive training in the proper application of the derivative classification principles of the Order, with an emphasis on avoiding over-classification, at least once every two years. Derivative classifiers who do not receive such training at least once every two years shall have their authority to apply derivative classification markings suspended until they have received such training. A waiver may be granted by the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services if an individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as practicable.

      § 1203.603   Systematic review for declassification:

#### § § 1203.603

      (a)  (1) NASA must establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review of NASA-originated records of permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this Order. The NASA Office of Protective Services shall prioritize the review of such records in coordination with the Center Protective Service Offices.

      (2) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review program for classified records:

      (i) Accessioned into the National Archives;

      (ii) Transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and

      (iii) For which the National Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.

      (3) The Chairperson, NISPC, shall designate experienced personnel to assist the Archivist in the systematic review of U.S. originated information and foreign information exempted from automated declassification. Such personnel shall:

      (i) Provide guidance and assistance to the National Archives and Records Service in identifying and separating documents and specific categories of information within documents which are deemed to require continued classification; and

      (ii) Develop reports of information or document categories so separated, with recommendations concerning continued classification.

      (iii) Develop, in coordination with NASA organizational elements, guidelines for the systematic review for declassification of classified information under NASA's jurisdiction. The guidelines shall state specific limited categories of information which, because of their national security sensitivity, should not be declassified automatically, but should be reviewed to determine whether continued protection beyond 25 years is needed. These guidelines are authorized for use by the Archivist and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, with the approval of the Senior Agency Official, which is the Assistant Administrator, Office of Protective Services, for categories listed in section 3.3 of the Order. These guidelines shall be reviewed at least every five years and revised as necessary, unless an earlier review for revision is requested by the Archivist. Copies of the declassification guidelines promulgated by NASA will be provided to the Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). All security classified records exempt from automatic declassification, whether held in storage areas under installation control or in Federal Records Centers, will be surveyed to identify those requiring scheduling for future disposition.

      (A) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises exclusive or final original classification authority and which is to be declassified in accordance with the systematic review guidelines shall be so marked.

      (B) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises exclusive or final original classification authority and which, in accordance with the systematic review guidelines is to be kept protected, shall be listed by category by the responsible custodian and referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee. This listing shall:

      () Identify the information or material involved.

      () Recommend classification beyond _2_5 years to a specific event scheduled to happen or a specific period of time in accordance with the Order.

      () The Administrator shall delegate to the Senior Agency Official the authority to determine which category shall be kept classified and the dates or event for declassification.

      () Declassification by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (DISOO). If the Director determines that NASA information is classified in violation of the Order, the Director may require the information to be declassified. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed through the NASA ISPC to the National Security Council. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.

      (b) [Reserved]

> [78 FR 5120, Jan. 24, 2013]

      § 1203.604   Mandatory review for declassification.

#### § § 1203.604

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information classified under the Order or predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the originating agency if:

      (1) The request for a review describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate it in a reasonably timely manner;

      (2) The document or material containing the information responsive to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance with law; and

      (3) The information is not the subject of pending litigation.

      (b)  Information originated by the President or Vice President; the President's White House Staff, or the Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the President are exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203. Procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a decision on the appeal.

      (c)  Requests for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the following:

      (1) Requests originating within NASA shall, in all cases, be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services.

      (2) For the most expeditious action, requests from other Governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services only. The requestor may submit the request to: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Central Registry, 300 E Street SW., Washington DC 20546, Attention: Office of Protective Services/Information Security Program Manager. The phrase, “Mandatory Declassification Review,” must be stated in the request.

      (d)  (1) Requests which are submitted under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be processed under the MDR process.

      (2) The request describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity, such as accession numbers, box titles or numbers, date and title of document, in any combination, to enable NASA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort, not to exceed 30 days. If more time is required, NASA will notify the requester. After review, the information or any portion thereof that no longer requires protection shall be declassified and released unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.

      (e)  Requests that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be processed as follows:

      (1) The NASA Office of Protective Services review upon receiving the initial request shall be completed within 365 days.

      (2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged promptly. The NASA Office of Protective Services shall determine whether, under the declassification provisions of this part 1203, the requested information may be declassified and, if so, shall make such information available to the requestor, unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the requestor shall be given a brief statement of the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in order to be considered.

      (3) All appeals of denials of requests for declassification shall be acted upon and determined finally within 120 working days after receipt, and the requester shall be advised that the appeal determination is final. If the requester is dissatisfied with NASA's appeal decision, the requester may initiate an appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP), within the Information Security Oversight Office. If continued classification is required under the provisions of this part 1203, the requester shall be notified of the reasons thereof.

      (4) The declassification and release of foreign government information that is subjected to mandatory review under this section shall be determined only in accordance with § 1203.703.

      (5) When the NASA Office of Protective Services receives any request for declassification of information in documents in its custody that was classified by another Government agency, it shall refer copies of the request and the requested documents to the originating agency for processing and may, after consultation with the originating agency, inform the requester of the referral.

      (f)  In response to a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of “the Order,” NASA shall refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classifiable under “the Order.”

      (g) —(1)  In the case of classified information or material transferred by or pursuant to statute or Executive Order to NASA in conjunction with a transfer of functions (not merely for storage purposes) for NASA's use and as part of its official files or property, as distinguished from transfers merely for purposes of storage, NASA shall be deemed to be the original classifying authority over such material for purposes of downgrading and declassification.

      (2)  When NASA has in its possession classified information or material originated by an agency which has since ceased to exist and that information has not been officially transferred to another department or agency or when it is impossible for NASA to identify the originating agency and a review of the material indicates that it should be downgraded or declassified, NASA shall be deemed to be the originating agency for the purpose of declassifying or downgrading such material. NASA will consult with the Information Security Oversight Office to assist in final disposition of the information.

      (3)  (i) Insofar as practicable, classified documents shall be reviewed to determine whether or not they can be downgraded or declassified prior to being forwarded to records centers or to the National Archives for storage. Any downgrading or declassification determination shall be indicated on each document by appropriate markings.

      (ii) Classified information transferred to the General Services Administration for accession into the Archives of the United States shall be downgraded or declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with “the Order,” the directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, GSA, and NASA guidelines.

      (h) —(1)  When classified material has been marked with specific dates or events for downgrading or declassification, it is not necessary to issue notices of such actions to any holders. However, when such actions are taken earlier than originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is shortened, the authority making such changes shall, to the extent practicable, ensure prompt notification to all addressees to whom the information or material was originally transmitted. The notification shall specify the marking action to be taken, the authority therefor, and the effective date. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall effect the proper changes and shall notify addressees to whom they have transmitted the classified information or material.

      (2)  If prompt remarking of large quantities would be unduly burdensome, the custodian may attach declassification, downgrading, or upgrading notices to the storage unit in lieu of the remarking action otherwise required. Each notice shall indicate the change, the authority for the action, the date of the action, and the storage units to which it applies. Items withdrawn from such storage units shall be promptly remarked. However, when information subject to a posted downgrading or declassification notice is withdrawn from one storage unit solely for transfer to another, or a storage unit containing such information is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may be made without remarking if the notice is attached to or remains with each shipment.

      (i)  In order to permit the State Department editors of  to meet their mandated goal of publishing 20 years after the event, NASA shall assist these editors by facilitating access to appropriate classified materials in its custody and by expediting declassification review of items from its files selected for publication.

    § 1203a.100   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1203a.100

    (a) To insure the uninterrupted and successful accomplishment of the NASA mission, certain designated security areas may be established and maintained by NASA Centers and Component Facilities in order to provide appropriate and adequate protection for facilities, property, or classified/proprietary information and material in the possession of NASA or NASA contractors located at NASA Centers and Component Facilities.

    (b) This part sets forth:

    (1) The designation and maintenance of security areas,

    (2) The responsibilities and procedures in connection therewith, and

    (3) The penalties that may be enforced through court actions against unauthorized persons entering security areas.

> [38 FR 8056, Mar. 28, 1973, as amended at 78 FR 5123, Jan. 24, 2013]

    § 1203a.101   Definitions.

#### § § 1203a.101

    For the purpose of this part, the following definitions apply:

    (a)  A physically defined area, established for the protection or security of facilities, property, or classfied/proprietary information and material in the possession of NASA or a NASA contractor located at a NASA Center or Component Facility, entry to which is subject to security measures, procedures, or controls. Security areas which may be established are:

    (1)  An area in which security measures are taken to safeguard and control access to property and hazardous materials or other sensitive material or to protect operations that are vital to the accomplishment of the mission assigned to a Center or Component Facility. The controlled area shall have a clearly defined perimeter, but permanent physical barriers are not required.

    (2)  An area in which security measures are taken to safeguard or control access to classified material or unclassified property warranting special protection or property and hazardous materials or to protect operations that are vital to the accomplishment of the mission assigned to a Center or Component Facility.

      (4) State that the prospective user is prepared to fully comply with the terms of this subpart 14 and the use permit which may be issued.

      (c) Upon receipt of the written request for permission to use the airport, the NASA official designated by each facility will request additional information, if necessary, and forward both this regulation and the required Hold Harmless Agreement for execution by the requestor or forward, where appropriate, a denial of the request.

      (d) The signed original of the Hold Harmless Agreement shall be returned to the designated NASA official, and a copy retained in the aircraft at all times. Such copy shall be exhibited upon proper demand by any designated NASA official.

      (e) At the same time that the prospective user returns the executed original of the Hold Harmless Agreement, the user shall forward to the designated NASA official the required Certificate of Insurance and waiver of rights to subrogation. Such certificate shall evidence that during any period for which a permit to use is being requested, the prospective user has in force a policy of insurance covering liability in amounts not less than those listed in the Hold Harmless Agreement.

      (f) When the documents (in form and substance) required by paragraphs b through e of this section have been received, they will be forwarded with a proposed use permit to the approving authority for action.

      (g) The designated NASA official will forward the executed use permit or notification of denial thereof to the prospective user after the approving authority has acted.

#### § § 1204.1406

      (a) Any aircraft involved in a declared in-flight emergency that endangers the safety of its passengers and aircraft may land at a NASA airfield. In such situations, the requirements for this subpart for advance authorizations, do not apply.

      (b) NASA personnel may use any method or means to clear the aircraft or wreckage from the runway after a landing following an in-flight emergency. Care will be taken to preclude unnecessary damage in so doing. However, the runway will be cleared as soon as possible for appropriate use.

      (c) The emergency user will be billed for all costs to the Government that result from the emergency landing. No landing fee will be charged, but the charges will include the labor, materials, parts, use of equipment, and tools required for any service rendered under these circumstances.

      (d) In addition to any report required by the Federal Aviation Administration, a complete report covering the landing and the emergency will be filed with the airfield manager by the pilot or, if the pilot is not available, any other crew member or passenger.

      (e) Before an aircraft which has made an emergency landing is permitted to take off (if the aircraft can and is to be flown out) the owner or operator thereof shall make arrangements acceptable to the approving authority to pay any charges assessed for services rendered and execute a Hold Harmless Agreement. The owner or operator may also be required to furnish a certificate of insurance, as provided in § 1204.1404, covering such takeoff.

      § 1204.1407   Procedure in the event of an unauthorized use.

#### § § 1204.1407

      Any aircraft not operated for benefit of the Federal Government which lands at a NASA airfield facility without obtaining prior permission from the approving authority, except in a bona fide emergency, is in violation of this subpart. Such aircraft will experience delays while authorization for departure is obtained pursuant to this subpart and may, contrary to the other provisions of this subpart, be required, at the discretion of the approving authority, to pay a user fee of not less than $100. Before the aircraft is permitted to depart, the approving authority will require full compliance with this subpart 1204.14, including the filing of a complete report explaining the reasons for the unauthorized landing. Violators could also be subject to legal liability for unauthorized use. When it appears that the violation of this subpart was deliberate or is a repeated violation, the matter will be referred to the Aircraft Management Office, NASA Headquarters, which will then grant any departure authorization.

      § 1206.100   Scope.

#### § § 1206.100

      This part 1206 establishes the policies, responsibilities, and procedures for the release of Agency records which are under the jurisdiction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, hereinafter NASA, to members of the public. This part applies to information and Agency records located at NASA Headquarters, and NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, herein NASA Headquarters and Centers, as defined in this part.

      § 1206.101   General policy.

#### § § 1206.101

      (a) In compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended 5 U.S.C. 552, a positive and continuing obligation exists for NASA, herein Agency, to make available to the fullest extent practicable upon request by members of the public, all Agency records under its jurisdiction, as described in this regulation.

      (b) Part 1206 does not entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any record that is not required under the FOIA.

      (c) The disclosure of exempt records, without authorization by the appropriate NASA official, is not an official release of information; accordingly, it is not a FOIA release. Such a release does not waive the authority of NASA to assert FOIA exemptions to withhold the same records in response to a FOIA request. In addition, while the authority may exist to disclose records to individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this part apply if the same individual seeks the records in a private or personal capacity.

    Subpart C—Procedures

      § 1206.300   How to make a request for Agency records.

#### § § 1206.300

      (a) A requester submitting a request for records must include his/her name, and an email or mailing address in order for the Agency to be able to send responsive records and/or to be able to contact the requester to obtain additional information or clarification of the request sought (see § 1206.301). The request must also address fees or provide justification for a fee waiver (see § 1206.302) as well as address the fee category in accordance with § 1206.507. The request should also include a telephone number in case the FOIA office needs to contact the requester regarding the request; however, this information is optional when submitting a request if an email or mailing address is provided. A requester may also submit a request online via the NASA FOIA website,  Do not include a social security number on any correspondence with the FOIA office. If the FOIA unit determines processing fees will exceed the fee category entitlement, the unit will require a personal mailing address for billing purposes or for commercial use requesters, a business mailing address.

      (b) NASA does not have a central location for submitting FOIA requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records in its possession. Instead, Agency records are decentralized and maintained by various Centers and offices throughout the country. All NASA Centers have the capability to receive requests electronically, either through email or a Web portal. To make a request for any of the NASA Center records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office of the Center that maintains the records being sought. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office of the Center that maintains the records requested. If a requester does not know which Center(s) may have the requested records, he/she may send his/her request(s) to the NASA's Headquarters (HQ) FOIA Public Liaison, 300 E Street SW, Room 5L19, Washington, DC 20546, Fax number: (202) 358-4332, email address:  and the HQ FOIA unit will forward the request to the Center(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.

      (c) NASA has not yet implemented a records management application for automated capture and control of e-records; therefore, official files are primarily paper files.

      (d) A member of the public may submit a FOIA request for an Agency record by mail, facsimile (FAX), electronic mail (email), or by submitting a written request in person to the FOIA office having responsibility over the record requested or to the NASA Headquarters (HQ) FOIA Office. A requester may also submit a request online via the NASA FOIA website.

      (e) When a requester is unable to determine the proper NASA FOIA Office to direct a request to, the requester may send the request to the NASA HQ FOIA Office, 300 E. Street SW., Washington, DC 20546-0001. The HQ FOIA Office will forward the request to the Center(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.

      (1) For locations, mailing/email addresses of NASA FOIA Centers, visit our website at

      (2) A misdirected request may take up to ten (10) additional working (meaning all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal legal holidays) days to reroute to the proper FOIA office.

      (f) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself (a Privacy Act request) must comply with the verification of identity provisions set forth in 14 CFR 1212.202.

      (g) Where a request pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by the individual who is the subject of the record requested, or a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or submit proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or a verifiable obituary).

      (h) As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each Center FOIA office may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary, i.e., a notarized statement from the subject of the file, in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to a third party disclosure. Information will only be released on a case-by-case basis to third party requesters if they have independently provided authorization from the individual who is the subject of the request.

      § 1206.301   Describing records sought.

#### § § 1206.301

      In view of the time limits under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) for an initial determination on a request for an Agency record, a request must meet the following requirements:

      (a) The request must be addressed to an appropriate FOIA office or otherwise be clearly identified in the letter as a request for an Agency record under the “Freedom of Information Act.”

      (b) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Agency personnel who are familiar with the subject area of the request to identify and locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a FOIA office in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought.

      (c) If NASA, after receiving a request, determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the NASA's designated FOIA contact or the Principal Agency FOIA Officer, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Agency's response to the request may be delayed or NASA may at its discretion close the request administratively.

      (d) Requests for clarification or more information will be made in writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible). Requesters may respond by U.S. mail or by electronic mail regardless of the method used by NASA to transmit the request for additional information. In order to be considered timely, responses to requests for additional information must be postmarked or received by electronic mail within twenty (20) working days of the postmark date or date of the electronic mail request for additional information or received by electronic mail by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on the 20th working day. If the requester does not respond to a request for additional information within the 20 working days, the request may be administratively closed at NASA's discretion. This administrative closure does not prejudice the requester's ability to submit a new request for further consideration with additional information.

      (e) NASA need not comply with a blanket or categorical request (such as “all matters relating to” a general subject) where it is not reasonably feasible to determine what record is sought.

      (f) NASA will in good faith attempt to identify and locate the record(s) sought and will consult with the requester when necessary and appropriate for that purpose in accordance with these regulations.

      (g) NASA is not required to create or compile records in response to a FOIA request.

      § 1206.302   Fee agreements.

#### § § 1206.302

      (a) A request must explicitly state a willingness to pay all fees associated with processing the request, fees up to a specified amount, or a request for a fee waiver, if processing fees will likely exceed the statutory entitlements as defined in § 1206.507(b) and (c).

      (b) If the FOIA office determines that fees for processing the request will exceed the agreed upon amount or the statutory entitlements, the FOIA office will notify the requester that:

      (1) He/she must provide assurance of payment for all anticipated fees or provide an advance payment if estimated fees are expected to exceed $250.00, or

      (2) The FOIA office will not be able to fully comply with the FOIA request unless an assurance or advance payment as requested has been provided.

      (3) He/she may wish to limit the scope of the request to reduce the processing fees.

      (c) If the FOIA office does not receive a written response within 20 working days after requesting the information, it will presume the requester is no longer interested in the records requested and will administratively close the request without further notification.

      (d) A commercial-use requester (as defined in§ 1206.507(c)(1)) must:

      (1) State a willingness to pay all fess associated with processing a request; or

      (2) State a willingness to pay fees to cover the costs of conducting an initial search for responsive records to determine a fee estimate.

      (e) If a requester is only willing to pay a limited amount for processing a request and it is for more than one document, the requester must state the order in which he/she would like the request for records to be processed.

      (f) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, the request must include sufficient justification to substantiate a waiver. (See subpart E of this part for information on fee waivers.) Failure to provide sufficient justification will result in a denial of the fee waiver request.

      (g) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, he/she may also choose to state a willingness to pay fees in case the fee waiver request is denied in order to allow the FOIA office to begin processing the request while considering the fee waiver.

      (h) If a fee is chargeable for search, review, duplication, or other costs incurred in connection with a request for an Agency record, the requester will be billed prior to releasing Agency documents. If the total amount of processing fees is under $50.00, the Agency will release the records when final processing is complete.

      (1) If the exact amount of the fee chargeable is not known at the time of the request, the requester will be notified in the initial determination (or in a final determination in the case of an appeal) of the amount of fees chargeable.

      (2) For circumstances in which advance payment of fees is required, the requester will be notified after the FOIA office has obtained an estimate of associated fees.

      (i) The FOIA office will begin processing a request only after the request has been properly described in accordance with these regulations and fees have been resolved.

      (j) If the requester is required to pay a fee and it is later determined on appeal that he/she was entitled to a full or partial fee waiver, a refund will be sent as appropriate.

      (k) NASA may refuse to consider a waiver or reduction of fees for requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees remain owed to the Agency for another information access request.

      § 1206.303   Format of records disclosed.

#### § § 1206.303

      (a) The FOIA office will provide the records in the requested format if the records can readily be reproduced from the original file to that specific format.

      (b) The FOIA office may charge direct costs associated with converting the records or files into the requested format if they are not maintained in that format. If the costs to convert the records exceed the amount the requester has agreed to pay, the FOIA office will notify the requester in writing. If the requester does not agree to pay the additional fees for converting the records, the records may not be provided in the requested format.

      § 1206.304   Expedited processing.

#### § § 1206.304

      A requester may ask for expedited processing of a request. However, information to substantiate the request must be included in accordance with § 1206.400, Criteria for Expedited Processing; otherwise, the request for expedited processing will be denied and processed in the simple or complex queue.

      § 1206.305   Responding to requests.

#### § § 1206.305

      (a) Except in the instances described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, the FOIA office that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the FOIA office responsible for responding to the request. The office shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than ten (10) working days to process. The NASA office responding to the request shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

      (b) In determining what records are responsive to a request, a FOIA office ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the FOIA office shall inform the requester of that date.

      (c) A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1)-(3), shall not be considered responsive to a request.

      (d) The Head of a Center, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that Center.

      (e) The FOIA office may refer a request to or consult with another Center FOIA office or Federal agency in accordance with § 1206.308, if the FOIA office receives a request for records that are in its possession that were not created at that Center. If another Center within NASA or another Federal agency has substantial interest in or created the records, the request will either be referred or they will consult with that FOIA office/agency.

      (f) If a request for an Agency record is received by a FOIA office not having responsibility of the record (for example, when a request is submitted to one NASA Center or Headquarters and another NASA Center has responsibility of the record), the FOIA office receiving the request shall promptly forward it to that FOIA office within 10 working days from the date of receipt. The receiving FOIA office shall acknowledge the request and provide the requester with a tracking number.

      § 1206.306   Granting a request.

#### § § 1206.306

      (a) Ordinarily, NASA shall have twenty (20) working days from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request unless there are unusual or exceptional circumstances. The FOIA office will not begin processing a request until all issues regarding scope and fees have been resolved. NASA will notify the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance in resolving these issues.

      (b) If fees are not expected to exceed the minimum threshold of $50.00, and the scope of the request is in accordance with § 1206.301, the FOIA office will begin processing the request.

      (c) If the FOIA office contacts the requester regarding fees or clarification and the requester has provided a response, the FOIA office will notify the requester in writing of the decision to either grant or deny the request.

> [79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54775, Oct. 11, 2019]

      § 1206.307   Denying a request.

#### § § 1206.307

      NASA shall withhold records only when it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law.

      (a) If the FOIA office denies records in response to a request either in full or in part, it will advise the requester in writing that:

      (1) The requested record(s) is exempt in full or in part; or

      (2) Records do not exist, cannot be located, are not in the Agency's control, or the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; or

      (3) A record is not readily reproducible in the form or format requested; and or

      (4) Denial is based on a procedural issue only and not access to the underlying records when it makes a decision that:

      (i) A fee waiver or another fee-related issue will not be granted; or

      (ii) Expedited processing will not be provided.

      (b) The denial notification must include:

      (1) The name, title, or position of the person(s) responsible for the denial;

      (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including a reference to any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the FOIA office to withhold records in full or in part;

      (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, i.e., the number of pages or a reasonable form of estimation, unless such an estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) used to withhold the records or information; and

      (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart G of this part and a description of the requirements set forth therein. NASA shall also inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance and include a statement notifying the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Should the requester elect to mediate any dispute related to the FOIA request with OGIS, NASA will participate in the mediation process in good faith.

      (c) If the requested records contain both exempt and non-exempt material, the FOIA office will:

      (1) Segregate and release the non-exempt material unless the non-exempt material is so intertwined with the exempt material that disclosure of it would leave only meaningless words and phrases;

      (2) Indicate on the released portion(s) of the records the amount of information redacted and the FOIA exemption(s) under which the redaction was made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the FOIA exemption used to withhold the information; and

      (3) If technically feasible, place the exemption at the place of excision.

> [79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54775, Oct. 11, 2019]

      § 1206.308   Referrals and consultations within NASA or other Federal Agencies.

#### § § 1206.308

      (a) Referrals and consultations can occur within the Agency or outside the Agency.

      (b) If a FOIA office (other than the Office of Inspector General) receives a request for records in its possession that another NASA FOIA office has responsibility over or is substantially concerned with, it will either:

      (1) Consult with the other FOIA office before deciding whether to release or withhold the records; or

      (2) Refer the request, along with the records, to that FOIA office for direct response.

      (c) If the FOIA office that originally received the request refers all or part of the request to another FOIA office within the Agency for further processing, they will notify the requester of the partial referral and provide that FOIA contact information.

      (d) If while responding to a request, the FOIA office locates records that originated with another Federal agency, it will generally refer the request and any responsive records to that other agency for a release determination and direct response.

      (e) If the FOIA office refers all the records to another agency, it will document the referral and maintain a copy of the records that it refers; notify the requester of the referral in writing, unless that identification will itself disclose a sensitive, exempt fact; and will provide the contact information for the other agency and if known, the name of a contact at the other agency.

      (f) If the FOIA office locates records that originated with another Federal agency while responding to a request, the office will make the release determination itself (after consulting with the originating agency) when:

      (1) The record is of primary interest to NASA (for example, a record may be of primary interest to NASA if it was developed or prepared according to Agency regulations or directives, or in response to an Agency request); or

      (2) NASA is in a better position than the originating agency to assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure; or

      (3) The originating agency is not subject to the FOIA; or

      (4) It is more efficient or practical depending on the circumstances.

      (g) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that another Federal agency has classified under any applicable executive order concerning record classification, it must refer the request to that agency for response.

      (h) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that are under the purview of another Federal agency, the office will return the request to the requester and may advise the requester to submit it directly to another agency. The FOIA office will then close the request.

      (i) All consultations and referrals received by the Agency will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first FOIA office.

    Subpart D—Procedures and Time Limits for Responding to Requests

      § 1206.400   Procedures for processing queues and expedited processing.

#### § § 1206.400

      (a) The FOIA office will normally process requests in the order in which they are received in each of the processing tracks.

      (b) FOIA offices use three queues for multi-track processing depending on the complexity of the request. Once it has been determined the request meets the criteria in accordance with subpart C of this part, the FOIA office will place the request in one of the following tracks:

      (1) Simple—A request that can be processed within 20 working days.

      (2) Complex—A request that will take over 20 working days to process. (A complex request will generally require coordination with more than one office and a legal 10 working day extension for unusual circumstances (see § 1206.403) may be taken either up front or during the first 20 days of processing the request.)

      (3) Expedited processing—A request for expedited processing will be processed in this track if the requester can show exceptional need or urgency that their request should be processed out of turn in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (c) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve one or more of the following:

      (1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

      (2) Circumstances in which there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity if the FOIA request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;

      (i) In most situations, a person primarily engaged in disseminating information will be a representative of the news media and therefore, will qualify as a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.

      (ii) To substantiate paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requested information must be the type of information which has particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly; this ordinarily refers to a breaking news story of general public interest. Information of historical interest only or information sought for litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media deadline unrelated to breaking news; or

      (3) The loss of substantial due process rights.

      (d) A request for expedited processing must contain a statement that:

      (1) Explains in detail how the request meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section; and

      (2) Certifies that the explanation is true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief.

      (3) If the request is made referencing paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requester must substantiate the public interest.

      (e) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests must be submitted to the FOIA office responsible for processing the requested records.

      (f) The FOIA office must notify the requester of its decision to grant or deny expedited processing within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt.

      (g) If expedited processing is granted, the request will be processed on a first-in, first-out basis in that queue.

      (h) If expedited processing is denied, the FOIA office will notify the requester and provide information on appealing this decision in accordance with Subpart G of this part and place the request in the appropriate processing queue.

      (i) If the FOIA office processing the request does not provide notification of either granting or denying the request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt, the requester may file an appeal for non-response in accordance with subpart G of this part.

      § 1206.401   Procedures and time limits for acknowledgement letters and initial determinations.

#### § § 1206.401

      (a) Following receipt of a request submitted under the FOIA, the FOIA staff will send an acknowledgement letter providing the case tracking number and processing track within ten (10) working days from date of receipt to the requester.

      (b) An initial determination is a decision by a NASA official, in response to a request by a member of the public for an Agency record, on whether the record described in the request can be identified and located after a reasonable search and, if so, whether the record (or portions thereof) will be made available under this part or will be withheld from disclosure under the FOIA.

      (c) An initial determination on a request for an Agency record addressed in accordance with this regulation (to include one submitted in person at a FOIA office) shall be made (for example, to grant, partially grant or deny a request), and the requester shall be sent an initial determination letter within 20 working days after receipt of the request, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (unless unusual circumstances exist as defined in § 1206.403).

      (d) The basic time limit for a misdirected FOIA request (not a referral or consultation) begins on the date on which the request is first received by the appropriate FOIA office within the Agency, but in any event no later than ten (10) working days after the date the request is first received by a FOIA office designated to receive FOIA requests.

      (e) Any notification of an initial determination that does not comply fully with the request for an Agency record, including those searches that produce no responsive documents, shall include a statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, include the name and title of the person making the initial determination, and notify the requester of the right to appeal to the Administrator or the Inspector General, as appropriate, pursuant to subpart G of this part, and the right to seek dispute resolution services from the NASA FOIA Public Liaison or Office of Government Information Services.

> [79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54776, Oct. 11, 2019]

      § 1206.402   Suspending the basic time limit.

#### § § 1206.402

      (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(I), the FOIA office may make one request to the requester for information to clarify a request and temporarily suspend (toll) the time (the 20-day period) while it is awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested from the requester. Receipt of the requester's response by the FOIA office to the Agency's request for additional information or clarification ends the temporary time suspension.

      (b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(II), the FOIA office may temporarily suspend (toll) the 20-day period as many times as is necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fees. Receipt of the requester's response by the FOIA office to the Agency's request for information regarding fees ends the temporary time suspension.

      § 1206.403   Time extensions.

#### § § 1206.403

      (a) In “unusual circumstances” as defined in this section, the time limits for an initial determination and for a final determination may be extended, but not to exceed a total of 10 working days in the aggregate in the processing of any specific request for an Agency record. The extension must be taken before the expiration of the 20 working day time limits. The requester will be notified in writing of:

      (1) The unusual circumstances surrounding the extension of the time limit;

      (2) The date by which the FOIA office expects to complete the processing of the request.

      (b) Unusual circumstances are defined as:

      (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from offices other than the office processing the request;

      (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous number of documents;

      (3) The need to coordinate and/or consult with another NASA office or agency having a substantial subject-matter interest in the determination of the request.

      (c) If initial processing time will exceed or is expected to exceed 30 working days, the FOIA office will notify the requester of the delay in processing and:

      (1) Provide the opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the Agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request;

      (2) Provide contact information for the NASA FOIA Public Liaison;

      (3) Offer the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the OGIS;

      (4) Provide information regarding the intended determination; and

      (5) Shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for the purpose of this paragraph (c).

      (d) The requester's refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing a request after being given the opportunity to do so may be considered a factor when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist. A delay that results from a predictable workload of requests does not constitute exceptional circumstances unless the Agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.

    Subpart E—Fees Associated With Processing Requests

      § 1206.500   Search.

#### § § 1206.500

      (a) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. A search will determine what specific documents, if any, are responsive to a request. A search for Agency records responsive to a request may be accomplished by manual or automated means.

      (b) Search charges, as set forth in this part, may be billed even when an Agency record, which has been requested, cannot be identified or located after a diligent search and consultation with a professional NASA employee familiar with the subject area of the request has been conducted or if located, cannot be made available under § 1206.308.

      (c) In responding to FOIA requests, FOIA offices shall charge the following fees based on the date the request is received in the NASA FOIA Office unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 1206.506. Fees will be determined on October 1st of each year based on the appropriate General Schedule (GS) base salary, plus the District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits of employees. Fees such as search, review, and duplication will be charged in accordance with the requester's fee category as defined in § 1206.507.

      (d) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be the average hourly GS-base salary, plus the District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits of employees in the following three categories, as applicable:

      (1) Clerical—Based on a GS-6, Step 5 (all employees at a GS-7 and below are classified as clerical for this purpose).

      (2) Professional—Based on a GS-11, Step 7 pay (all employees at a GS-8 through GS-12 are classified as professional for this purpose);

      (3) Managerial—Based on GS-14, Step 2, pay (all employees at a GS-13 and above are classified as managerial for this purpose).

      (e) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to locate the requested records.

      (f) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

      § 1206.501   Review.

#### § § 1206.501

      (a) Review means the process of examining a document(s) located in response to a request to determine whether the document(s) or any portion thereof is disclosable. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (b) Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by Agency staff to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record.

      (c) Review fees will be charged to commercial use requesters.

      (d) No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, when the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with an additional review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.

      (e) Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under § 1206.500.

      (f) Review fees can be charged even if the record(s) reviewed ultimately is not disclosed.

      (g) Review fees will not include costs incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a request under this section.

      § 1206.502   Duplication.

#### § § 1206.502

      (a) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

      (b) FOIA offices shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the FOIA office in the form or format requested. If the records are not readily reproducible in the requested form or format, the Agency will so inform the requester. The requester may specify an alternative form or format that is available. If in this situation the requester refuses to specify an alternative form or format, the Agency will not process the request any further.

      (c) Where standard-sized photocopies or scans are supplied, the FOIA office will provide one copy per request at the regular copy rate per page.

      (d) For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, FOIA offices will charge the direct costs of producing the copy in the form or format requested, including the time spent by personnel duplicating the requested records. For each quarter hour spent by personnel duplicating the requested records, the fees will be the same as those charged for a search under this subpart.

      (e) If NASA staff must scan paper documents in order to accommodate a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the appropriate copy fee charge per page as well as each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records. Fees will be the same as those charged for search under this subpart for each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records.

      (f) For other forms of duplication, FOIA offices will charge the direct costs as well as any associated personnel costs. For standard-sized copies of documents such as letters, memoranda, statements, reports, contracts, etc., $0.15 per copy of each page; charges for double-sided copies will be $0.30. For copies of oversized documents, such as maps, charts, etc., fees will be assessed as direct costs. Charges for copies (and scanning) include the time spent in duplicating the documents. For copies of computer disks, still photographs, blueprints, videotapes, engineering drawings, hard copies of aperture cards, etc., the fee charged will reflect the direct cost to NASA of reproducing, copying, or scanning the record. In circumstances where a request for a videotape or other outdated media is requested, and NASA does not have the capability to readily reproduce the record in the form or format requested and which requires the Agency to enlist the services of a private contractor to fulfill the request, the direct costs of any services by the private contractor will be charged to the requester. Specific charges will be provided upon request.

      (g) If the request for an Agency record required to be made available under this part requires a computerized search or printout, the charge for the time of personnel involved shall be at the rates specified in this part or the direct costs assessed to the Agency. The charge for computer time involved and for any special supplies or materials used shall not exceed the direct cost to NASA.

      (h) Reasonable standard fees may be charged for additional direct costs incurred in searching for or duplicating an Agency record in response to a request under this part. Charges made under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the transportation of NASA personnel to places of record storage for search purposes or freight charges for transporting records to the personnel searching for or duplicating a requested record.

      (i) Complying with requests for special services such as those listed in this section is entirely at the discretion of NASA. To the extent that NASA elects to provide the following services, it will levy a charge equivalent to the full cost of the service provided:

      (1) Certifying that records are true copies.

      (2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.

      § 1206.503   Restrictions on charging fees.

#### § § 1206.503

      (a) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.

      (b) If NASA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.

      (1) If a NASA component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and the component provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

      (2) If NASA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Agency may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The Agency must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the component must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If the exception in this paragraph (b)(2) is satisfied, the Agency may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

      (3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (c) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

      (d) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, NASA will provide without charge:

      (1) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

      (2) The first two hours of search.

      (e) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under § 1206.504 is less than $50.00 for any request, no fee will be charged.

> [79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54776, Oct. 11, 2019]

      § 1206.504   Charging fees.

#### § § 1206.504

      (a) NASA shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and the OMB Guidelines. NASA will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method for processing requested records. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, NASA may contact a requester for additional information. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. The submission of a FOIA request shall be considered a firm commitment by the requester to pay all applicable fees charged under this section, up to $50.00, unless the requester seeks a waiver of fees. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. When a FOIA office determines or estimates the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will amount to or exceed $50.00, the FOIA office shall notify the requester unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If a portion of the fees can be readily estimated, the FOIA office shall advise the requester accordingly.

      (b) In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees are in excess of $50.00, the request shall be placed on hold and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated fees. Such a commitment must be made by the requester in writing, must indicate a given dollar amount or a willingness to pay all processing fees, and must be received by the FOIA office within 20 working days from the date of the letter providing notification of the fee estimate. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

      (c) After the FOIA office begins processing a request, if it finds that the actual cost will exceed the amount the requester previously agreed to pay, the FOIA office will stop processing the request and promptly notify the requester of the higher amount. The request will be placed on hold until the fee issue has been resolved. If the issue is not resolved within 20 working days from the date of the notification letter, NASA will provide the requester, if the requester is a non-commercial use requester, the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and shall advise the requester that his statutory entitlements have been provided before closing the request.

      (d) Direct costs, meaning those expenditures that NASA actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and downloading computer files and documents in response to a FOIA request, will be included on the invoice as appropriate. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee who would ordinarily perform the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners, the costs associated with retrieving records stored at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, as well as costs for CDs and other media tools.

      (e) NASA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the FOIA office. NASA will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (f) If processing fees are less than $50.00, NASA will send all releaseable documents (or portions thereof) following the completion of the initial determination. If fees are greater than $50.00, the documents will not be released until the invoice has been paid and verified by the FOIA office.

      (g) Final billing will be sent when the initial determination has been completed. At that time the case will be closed.

      § 1206.505   Advance payments.

#### § § 1206.505

      (a) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section, a FOIA office shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment for search, review and/or before records are released to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (b) When a FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A FOIA office may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester.

      (c) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee assessed by any FOIA office in the agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a FOIA office may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest due on the outstanding debt, before the FOIA office begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending remand of an appeal. Once the outstanding bill has been paid, the FOIA office may also require the requester to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before processing the new request.

      (d) Where a FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide further proof of identity.

      (e) In cases in which a FOIA office requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received, and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 20 working days after the date of the FOIA office's letter, the request will be closed without further notification.

      (f) When advance payment is required in order to initiate processing, after a fee estimate has been determined, the FOIA office will require payment before continuing to process the request.

      (g) The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the FOIA office will inform the requester of the contact information for that source.

      § 1206.506   Requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees.

#### § § 1206.506

      (a) The burden is on the requester to justify an entitlement to a fee waiver. (See § 1206.507 for a discussion on fee categories.)

      (b) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis using the criteria in this section. These statutory requirements must be satisfied by the requester before properly assessable fees are waived or reduced under the statutory standard.

      (c) Records shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate if the requester has demonstrated, based on all available information, that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it:

      (1) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and

      (2) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (d) In deciding whether the standards of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, the Agency must consider the factors described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:

      (1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

      (2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. The factor in this paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about Government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. NASA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy the consideration in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).

      (3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components will consider the following criteria:

      (i) NASA, and its Centers processing requests, must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding the consideration in this paragraph (d)(3)(i).

      (ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, NASA must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. NASA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

      (4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees under this section, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

      (5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to NASA and should address the criteria referenced in paragraph (d) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

      (e) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee waiver.

      (f) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a partial waiver shall be granted for those records.

      (g) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Agency and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal.

      (h) When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received by the office processing the original request.

      (i) When deciding whether to waive or reduce fees, the FOIA office will rely on the fee waiver justification submitted in the request letter. If the request letter does not include sufficient justification, the FOIA office will either deny the fee waiver request or at its discretion, ask for additional justification from the requester.

      (j) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee waiver.

      § 1206.507   Categories of requesters.

#### § § 1206.507

      (a) A request should indicate the fee category. If the requester does not indicate a fee category, or it is unclear to the FOIA office, the FOIA office will make a determination of the fee category based on the request. If the requester does not agree with their determination, he/she will be afforded the opportunity to provide information to support a different fee category.

      (b) If the request is submitted on behalf of another person or organization (e.g., if an attorney is submitting a request on behalf of a client), the fee category will be determined by considering the underlying requester's identity and intended use of the information. The following table outlines the basic fee categories and applicable fees:

      (c) The FOIA provides for three categories of requesters. However, for clarity purposes, NASA has broken them down to four for the purposes of determining fees. These four categories of FOIA requesters are: Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories, which is indicated in the FOIA fee table above.

      (1)  When NASA receives a request for documents appearing to be for commercial use, meaning a request from or on behalf of one whom seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation, of either the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, it will assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. NASA will not consider a commercial-use request for a waiver or reduction of fees based upon an assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest. A request from a corporation (not a news media corporation) may be presumed to be for commercial use unless the requester demonstrates that it qualifies for a different fee category. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two (2) hours of search time or to 100 pages of duplication of documents without charge.

      (2)  To be eligible for inclusion in the category in this paragraph (c)(2), requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not being sought for a commercial use (not operated for commerce, trade, or profit), but are being sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.

      (i) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in the fee category in this paragraph (c)(2) must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. NASA may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in the category in this paragraph (c)(2). A request for educational purposes may be presumed if submitted on the Institution's letterhead and signed by the Dean of the School or Department.

      (A)  A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.

      (B)  A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.

      (C)  A student, who makes a request in furtherance of the student's coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of the fee category in this paragraph (c)(2).

      (ii) For the purposes of a non-commercial scientific institution, it must be solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. Requests must be sent on the letterhead of the scientific institution and signed by the responsible official-in-charge of the project/program associated with the subject of the documents that are being requested.

      (3)  (i) NASA shall provide documents to requesters in the category in this paragraph (c)(3) for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.

      (ii) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. These examples are not all inclusive. As methods of news delivery evolve, alternative news media entities may come into existence. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. Agencies will advise requesters of their placement in the category in this paragraph (c)(3).

      (iii) Requesters seeking the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3) who do not articulate sufficient information to support their request will not be included in the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3). Additionally, FOIA staff may grant a reduction of fees if the requester can articulate the information of this section for some of the documents.

      (4)  NASA shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories mentioned in this section fees in accordance with the fee table in paragraph (b) of this section.

      § 1206.508   Aggregation of requests.

#### § § 1206.508

      (a) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees.

      (b) When NASA has reason to believe that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests on a single subject or related subjects for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, NASA will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.

      (c) NASA will consider that multiple requests made within a 30-day period were so intended submitted as such to avoid fees, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

      (d) NASA will aggregate requests separated by a longer period of time only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.

      (e) NASA will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester or organization.

      § 1206.509   Form of payment.

#### § § 1206.509

      Payment shall be made by check or money order payable to the “Treasury of the United States,” or by credit card per instructions in the initial determination or billing invoice and sent to NASA.

      § 1206.510   Nonpayment of fees.

#### § § 1206.510

      (a) Requesters are advised that should they fail to pay the fees assessed, they may be charged interest on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

      (b)  Requesters are advised that if full payment is not received within 60 days after the billing was sent, the procedures of the Debt Collection Act may be invoked (14 CFR 1261.407-1261.409). These procedures include three written demand letters at not more than 30-day intervals, disclosure to a consumer reporting agency, and the use of a collection agency, where appropriate.

      § 1206.511   Other rights and services.

#### § § 1206.511

      Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any record that is not required under the FOIA.

    Subpart F—Commercial Information

      § 1206.600   General policy.

#### § § 1206.600

      (a) Notice shall be given to a submitter whenever the information requested is commercial information and has been designated by the submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Act, or the Agency otherwise has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. For the purpose of applying the notice requirements, commercial information is information provided by a submitter and in the possession of NASA, that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under the provisions of Exemption 4 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). The meaning ascribed to this term for the purpose of this notice requirement is separate and should not be confused with use of this or similar terms in determining whether information satisfies one of the elements of Exemption 4.

      (b) A submitter is a person or entity outside the Federal Government from whom the Agency directly or indirectly obtains commercial or financial information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to corporations, state governments, individuals, and foreign governments.

      (c) The notice requirements of § 1206.601 will not apply if:

      (1) The information has been lawfully published or officially made available to the public; or

      (2) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute (other than this part); or

      (3) The submitter has received notice of a previous FOIA request which encompassed information requested in the later request, and the Agency intends to withhold and/or release information in the same manner as in the previous FOIA request.

      (d) An additional limited exception to the notice requirements of § 1206.601, to be used only when all of the following exceptional circumstances are found to be present, authorizes the Agency to withhold information that is the subject of a FOIA request, based on Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), without providing the submitter individual notice when:

      (1) The Agency would be required to provide notice to over ten (10) submitters, in which case, notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.

      (2) Absent any response to the published notice, the Agency determines that if it provided notice as is otherwise required by § 1206.601, it is reasonable to assume that the submitter would object to disclosure of the information based on Exemption 4; and,

      (3) If the submitter expressed the anticipated objections, the Agency would uphold those objections.

      (e) The exception shall be used only with the approval of the Chief Counsel of the Center, the Counsel to the Inspector General, or the Associate General Counsel responsible for providing advice on the request. This exception shall not be used for a class of documents or requests, but only as warranted by an individual FOIA request.

      § 1206.601   Notice to submitters.

#### § § 1206.601

      (a) Except as provided in § 1206.603(b) and § 1206.603(c), the Agency shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request that seeks its commercial information whenever required under § 1206.600(a).

      (b) A notice to a submitter must include:

      (1) The exact language of the request or an accurate description of the request;

      (2) Access to or a description of the responsive records or portions thereof containing the commercial information to the submitter;

      (3) A description of the procedures for objecting to the release of the possibly confidential information under § 1206.602;

      (4) A time limit for responding to the Agency that shall not exceed 10 working days from the date of the letter sent to the submitter by the FOIA Office or publication of the notice (as set forth in § 1206.603(b)) to object to the release and to explain the basis for the objection;

      (5) Notice that the information contained in the submitter's objections may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA;

      (6) Notice that the Agency, not the submitter, is responsible for deciding whether the information shall be released or withheld;

      (7) Notice that failing to respond within the timeframe specified under § 1206.601(b)(4) will create a presumption that the submitter has no objection to the disclosure of the information in question.

      (c) Whenever the Agency provides notice pursuant to this section, the Agency shall advise the requester that notice and opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter.

      § 1206.602   Opportunity to object to disclosure.

#### § § 1206.602

      (a) If a submitter has any objections to the disclosure of commercial information, the submitter must provide a detailed written statement to the FOIA office that specifies all factual and/or legal grounds for withholding the particular information under any FOIA exemptions.

      (b) The submitter must include a daytime telephone number, an email and mailing address, and a fax number if available on a response to the FOIA office.

      (c) A submitter who does not respond within the time period specified under this subpart will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information.

      (d) Responses received by the FOIA office after the time period specified in § 1206.601(b)(4) will not be considered by the FOIA office. An extension of time to respond may be granted provided the submitter provides an explanation justifying additional time within the time period specified in § 1206.601(b)(4).

      § 1206.603   Notice of intent to disclose.

#### § § 1206.603

      (a) The Agency shall carefully consider any objections of the submitter in the course of determining whether to disclose commercial information. The Agency, not the submitter, is responsible for deciding whether the information will be released or withheld.

      (b) Whenever the Agency decides to disclose commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the Agency shall forward to the submitter a written statement which shall include the following:

      (1) A brief explanation as to why the Agency did not agree with any objections;

      (2) A description of the commercial information to be disclosed, sufficient to identify information to the submitter; and

      (3) A date after which disclosure is expected, which shall be no less than 10 working days from the date of the letter providing notification to the submitter by the FOIA Office (§ 1206.601).

      (c) The FOIA office will provide notification regarding a FOIA lawsuit:

      (1) To a submitter, when a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of commercial information; or

      (2) To a requester, when a submitter brings suit against the Agency in order to prevent disclosure of commercial information.

    Subpart G—Appeals

      § 1206.700   How to submit an appeal.

#### § § 1206.700

      (a) A member of the public who has requested an Agency record in accordance with subpart C of this part, and who has received an initial determination which does not comply fully with the request, may appeal such an adverse initial determination to the Administrator, or, for records as specified in § 1206.805, to the Inspector General within 90 days from the date of the initial determination letter.

      § 1212.201   Requesting a record.

#### § § 1212.201

      (a) Individuals may request access to their Privacy Act records, either in person, in writing, or electronically.

      (b) Individuals may also authorize a third party to have access to their Privacy Act records. This authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual, or submitted electronically. Requests must contain the individual's address or email address, as well as the name, address or email address of the representative being authorized access. The identities of both the subject individual and the representative must be verified in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1212.202.

      (c)(1) In-person or written requests must be directed to the appropriate system manager, or, if unknown, to the Center Privacy Manager or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at NASA Headquarters or Field Center. The request should be identified clearly on the envelope and on the letter as a “Request Under the Privacy Act.”

      (2) Electronic requests may be initiated online at

      (3) Where possible, requests should contain the following information to ensure timely processing:

      (i) Name and address of subject.

      (ii) Email address of subject, for electronic requests only.

      (iii) Identity of the system of records.

      (iv) Nature of the request.

      (v) Identifying information specified in the applicable system notice to assist in identifying the request, such as location of the record, if known, full name, birth date, time periods in which the records are believed to have been compiled, etc.

      (d) NASA has no obligation to comply with a nonspecific request for access to information concerning an individual,  a request to provide copies of “all information contained in your files concerning me,” although a good faith effort will be made to locate records if there is reason to believe NASA has records on the individual. If the request is so incomplete or incomprehensible that the requested record cannot be identified, additional information or clarification will be requested in the acknowledgement, and assistance to the individual will be offered as appropriate.

      (e) If the Center Privacy Manager receives a request for access, the Privacy Manager will record the date of receipt and immediately forward the request to the responsible system manager for handling.

      (f) If the Center FOIA Office receives a first party request for records or access, the FOIA Office will process the request under the Privacy Act pursuant to this part.

      (g) Normally, the system manager shall respond to a request for access within 10 business days of receipt of the request and the access shall be provided within 30 business days of receipt.

      (1) In response to a request for access, the system manager or Privacy Act Officer shall:

      (i) Notify the requester that there is no record on the individual in the system of records and inform the requester of the procedures to follow for appeal (see § 1212.4);

      (ii) Notify the requester that the record is exempt from disclosure, cite the appropriate exemption, and inform the requester of the procedures to follow for appeal (see § 1212.4);

      (iii) Upon request, promptly provide copies of the record, subject to the fee requirements (see § 1212.204); or

      (iv) Make the individual's record available for personal inspection in the presence of a NASA representative.

      (2) Unless the system manager agrees to another location, personal inspection of the record shall be at the location of the record as identified in the system notice.

      (3) When an individual requests records in a system of records maintained on a third party, the request shall be processed as a FOIA request under 14 CFR part 1206. If the records requested are subject to release under FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), then a Privacy Act exemption may not be invoked to deny access.

      (4) When an individual requests records in a system of records maintained on the individual, the request shall be processed under this part. NASA will not rely on exemptions contained in FOIA to withhold any record which is otherwise accessible to the individual under this part.

      (ii) Criminal Matter Records are contained in the system of records and are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2):  That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that they would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which they would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:

      (A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.

      (B) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.

      (C) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure of information about third parties, including other subjects of investigation, law enforcement personnel, and sources of information.

      (D) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources.

      (E) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.

      (F) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures.

      (G) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential sources and law enforcement personnel.

      (iii) The system of records includes records subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) (required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy), and such records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).

      (c) —(1)  _Harassment Report Case Files_ records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a): subsection (c)(3) relating to access to the disclosure accounting; subsection (d) relating to access to the records; subsection (e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in the records; subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing in the annual system notice information as to agency procedures for access and correction and information as to the categories of sources of records; and subsection (f) relating to developing agency rules for gaining access and making corrections.

      (2) —(i)  The release of the disclosure accounting to the individual who is the subject of the investigation/fact-finding would present a serious impediment to NASA's ability to conduct fact-findings into potential violations of law or policy.

      (ii)  Access to records contained in this system would inform the subject of an actual or potential investigation, of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the investigation, of the information and evidence obtained as to their activities, and of the identity of witnesses. Such access would impede a fact-finder/investigator's ability to freely investigate such cases, including concerns that some witnesses have been promised confidentiality and would not want their statements provided to the subject of the investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with the ongoing fact-finding process.

      (iii)  Under the provision of (e)(1), the agency must only maintain such information that is relevant and necessary. It is difficult to know during the course of an investigation what is relevant and necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.

      (iv)  These subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these systems are exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).

      (v)  The categories of sources of the records in these systems have been published in the  in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and related law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.

      (vi)  Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the individual dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation or case, pending or future. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities are under investigation or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act, the rules required pursuant to subsections (f)(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).

      (3)  NASA has determined that the exemption of this system of records from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f) of the Privacy Act is necessary for the Agency's law enforcement efforts to address and eradicate harassment in its workplace.

#### § § 1213.106

    (a) Release of classified information in any form (e.g., documents, through interviews, audio/visual) to the news media is prohibited. The disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals may be cause for prosecution and/or disciplinary action against the NASA employee involved. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding classified information does not release a NASA employee from responsibility for preventing any unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1, Chapter 5, Section 5.23 for internal NASA guidance on management of classified information. For further guidance that applies to all agencies, see Executive Order 12958, as amended, “Classified National Security Information,” and its implementing directive at 32 CFR parts 2001 and 2004.

    § 1213.107   Preventing unauthorized release of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information/material to the news media.

#### § § 1213.107

    (a) All NASA SBU information requires accountability and approval for release. Release of SBU information to unauthorized personnel is prohibited. Unauthorized release of SBU information may result in prosecution and/or disciplinary action. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding SBU information does not release a NASA employee from responsibility for unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1, Chapter 5, Section 5.24 for guidance on identification, marking, accountability and release of NASA SBU information.

    (b) Examples of SBU information include: proprietary information of others provided to NASA under nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement; source selection and bid and proposal information; information subject to export control under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR); information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974; predecisional materials such as national space policy not yet publicly released; pending reorganization plans or sensitive travel itineraries; and information that could constitute an indicator of U.S. Government intentions, capabilities, operations, or activities or otherwise threaten operations security.

    (c) Upon request for access to information/material deemed SBU, coordination must be made with the information/material owner to determine if the information/material may be released. Other organizations that play a part in SBU information identification, accountability, and release (e.g., General Counsel, External Relations, Procurement) must be consulted for assistance and/or concurrence prior to release.

    (d) Requests for SBU information from other Government agencies must be referred to the NASA program or other office responsible for handling the information as SBU.

      § 1215.108   Defining user service requirements.

#### § § 1215.108

      Potential users should become familiar with TDRSS capabilities and constraints, which are detailed in the NSNUG, as early as possible. This action allows the user to evaluate the trade-offs available among various TDRSS services, spacecraft design, operations planning, and other significant mission parameters. It is recommended that potential users contact the Near Space Network as early as possible for assistance in performing the trade studies. When these evaluations have been completed, and the user desires to use TDRSS, the user should initiate a request for TDRSS service.

      (a) Initial requests for TDRSS service from non-U.S. Government users shall be addressed to SCaN at NASA Headquarters, as follows: Deputy Associate Administrator: Space Communications and Navigation Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546.

      (b) Upon review and acceptance of the service request, preliminary analyses shall be performed to determine the feasibility of meeting the proposed requirements.

      (c) If the request is determined to be feasible, the user and SCaN shall negotiate an agreement for provision of the requested services. Acceptance of user requests for TDRSS service is the sole prerogative of NASA.

      (d) Upon approval of the agreement by both parties, GSFC will be assigned to produce the detailed requirements, plans, and documentation necessary for support of the mission. Changes to user requirements shall be made as far in advance as possible and shall be submitted, in writing, to both SCaN at NASA Headquarters (see Section 108, paragraph (a) for mailing address) and GSFC, as follows: Chief: Commercialization, Innovation, and Synergies, Code 450.1, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, M/S 450.1, 8800 Greenbelt Road Greenbelt, MD 20771.

      § 1215.109   Scheduling user service.

#### § § 1215.109

      (a) User service shall be scheduled only by NASA. TDRSS services will be provided in accordance with operational priorities established by the NASA Administrator or his/her designee. See Appendix A for a description of a typical user activity timeline.

      (b) Schedule conflict will be resolved in general by application of principles of priority to user service requirements. Services shall be provided either as normally scheduled service or as emergency service. Priorities will be different for emergency service than for normal services.

      (1) Normally scheduled service is service which is planned and ordered under normal operational conditions and is subject to schedule conflict resolution under normal service priorities. Requests for normally scheduled service must be received by the schedulers at the GSFC WSC Data Services Management Center (DSMC) no later than 21 days prior to the requested support time.

      (2) At times, emergency service requirements will override normal schedule priority. Under emergency service conditions, disruptions to scheduled service will occur.

      (3) The DSMC reserves the sole right to schedule, reschedule, or cancel TDRSS service.

      (4) NASA schedulers will exercise judgment and endeavor to see that lower-priority users are not excluded from a substantial portion of their contracted-for service due to the requirements of higher-priority users.

      (c) General user service requirements, which will be used for preliminary planning and mission modeling, should include all pertinent information necessary for NASA to determine if the proposed service is achievable. Contact Near Space Network to discuss usage and requirements.

      (d) Such user service requirements information typically includes:

      (1) Date of service initiation.

      (2) The type of TDRSS services desired (e.g., multiple access, tracking, ), and the frequency and duration of each service.

      (3) Orbit or trajectory parameters and tracking data requirements.

      (4) Spacecraft events significant to tracking, telemetry or command requirements.

      (5) Communications systems specifics, including location of antennas and other related information dealing with user tracking, command, and data systems.

      (6) Special test requirements, data flows, and simulations,

      (7) Identification of terrestrial data transport requirements, interface points, and delivery locations, including latency and line loss recovery.

      (e) To provide for effective planning, reference Appendix A, Typical New User Activity Timeline.

      § 1215.110   User cancellation of all services.

#### § § 1215.110

      The user has the right to terminate its service contract with NASA at any time. A user who exercises this right after contracting for service shall pay the charge agreed upon for services previously rendered, and the cost incurred by the Government for support of pre-launch activities, services, and mission documentation not included in that charge. The user will remain responsible for the charges for any services actually provided.

      § 1215.111   User postponement of service.

#### § § 1215.111

      The user may postpone the initiation of contracted service (e.g., user launch date) by delivery of written notification to NASA Headquarters, Code OX. Any delay in the contracted start of service date may affect the quantity of service to be provided due to commitments to other support requirements. Therefore, the validity of previous estimates of predicted support availability may no longer be applicable.

#### § § 1215.115

      (a) The procedure for billing and payment of standard TDRSS services is as follows:

      (1) NASA shall be reimbursed by customers in connection with the use of Government property and services provided under an approved reimbursable agreement. Advance payment for services is required. Advance payments shall be scheduled to keep pace with the rate at which NASA anticipates incurring costs. NASA will provide a Customer Budget/Estimate (CBE) for services rendered nominally 60-90 days in advance, or as otherwise agreed, of the first anticipated property use or required service date for each mission. The full cost of the mission shall be paid by the customer not later than 30 days prior to the first anticipated property use or required service date.

      (2) In some cases, an advance partial payment will be required six—nine months prior to the first anticipated property use or required service date in order for advance planning work and/or travel to take place. The amount of this partial payment and its receipt shall be negotiated on an as-needed basis. Adjustments to the amounts prepaid will be made to the succeeding billings as the actual services are rendered.

      (3) If the customer fails to make payment by the payment due date, NASA may terminate the agreement and any subagreements for breach of agreement after notice to the customer is given of this breach and failure to cure such breach within a time period established by NASA.

      (b) Late payments by the user will require the user to pay a late payment charge.

      § 1216.303   NEPA process in NASA planning and decision making.

#### § § 1216.303

      (a) NEPA is a procedural statute intended to ensure Federal agencies consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions in the decision-making process. Full integration of the NEPA process with NASA project and program planning improves Agency decisions and ensures:

      (1) Consideration of sustainability, environmental stewardship, and compliance with applicable environmental statutes, regulations, and policies.

      (2) NASA's analyses and documentation are prepared using a process that is transparent to the public, including opportunities for receipt and consideration of public comment, when appropriate.

      (3) Potential program and project risks and delays are minimized.

      (b) In considering whether the effects of a proposed action are significant and determining the appropriate level of NEPA review and documentation ( EIS, environmental assessments (EA), categorical exclusions (CatEx)), NASA shall consider and analyze the potentially affected environment ( affected area [national, regional, or local] and resources located therein) and the degree of the effects of the proposed action ( short- and long-term effects, effects both beneficial and adverse, effects on public health and safety, effects that would violate Federal, state, Tribal, or local law protecting the environment).

      (c) NASA shall consider the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of a proposed Agency action, along with technical, economic, public health and safety, security, and other factors that are reasonably foreseeable, beginning in the early planning stage of a proposed action. NASA will not take any action that would have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives prior to completing NEPA review except as provided in 40 CFR 1506.1.

      (d) Records of Environmental Consideration (RECs) will be used to document: (1) Application of specific categorical exclusions to proposed actions;

      (2) Adoption of Federal draft or final NEPA documents;

      (3) Reevaluation of an existing NEPA document; and

      (4) Determination of whether an action fits within an existing NEPA document, including a programmatic NEPA document.

> [89 FR 25500, Apr. 11, 2024]

      § 1216.304   Categorical exclusions.

#### § § 1216.304

      (a) Categorical exclusions (CatExs) are categories of Agency actions that normally do not have a significant effect on the human environment and therefore do not require preparation of an EA or EIS. CatExs reduce paperwork, improve Government efficiency, and eliminate delays in initiating and completing proposed actions having no significant environmental impact. For some CatExs, as indicated in paragraph (d) of this section, a REC is required.

      (b) Application of CatExs and presence of extraordinary circumstances:

      (1) A proposed action may be categorically excluded if the action fits within the categories listed in paragraph (d) of this section and it does not involve any extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant effect.

      (2) If an extraordinary circumstance as described in paragraph (c) of this section is present, NASA may nevertheless categorically exclude the proposed action if the action fits within the categories listed in paragraph (d) of this section and NASA determines that implementation of mitigation measures, such as relocation of the proposed action to an alternative site or limiting construction activities to certain seasonal periods of the year to avoid the extraordinary circumstance(s) in question, are sufficient to allow the proposed action to be categorically excluded.

      (c) Extraordinary circumstances include situations where the proposed action:

      (1) Has a reasonable likelihood of having a significant effect on public health and safety or the human environment.

      (2) Imposes uncertain or unique environmental risks.

      (3) Is of significantly greater scope or size than is normal for the particular category of action.

      (4) Has a reasonable likelihood of having effects that would violate Federal, state, Tribal, or local laws, or other enforceable requirements applicable to environmental protection.

      (5) May adversely affect sensitive resources, such as, but not limited to, Federally listed threatened or endangered species, their designated critical habitat, wilderness areas, floodplains, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, coastal zones, wild and scenic rivers, and significant fish or wildlife habitat, unless the impact has been resolved through another environmental review process ( the Clean Water Act (CWA) or the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)).

      (6) May adversely affect national natural landmarks or cultural or historic resources, including, but not limited to, property listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, unless the impact has been resolved through another review process ( the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)).

      (d) The following actions normally do not have a significant effect on the human environment and are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or EIS:

      (1) Administrative Activities including:

      (i) Personnel actions, organizational changes, and procurement of routine goods and services.

      (ii) Issuing procedural rules, manuals, directives, and requirements.

#### § § 1217.102

    In order to encourage and facilitate the use of NASA's launch services for the exploration and use of space, section 116 of Public Law 97-446 provided for the duty-free entry into the United States of certain articles imported by NASA for its space-related activities or articles imported by another person or entity for the purpose of meeting its obligations under a launch services agreement with NASA. Such articles were certified by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs for duty-free entry to be launched into space or space parts or necessary and uniquely associated support equipment for use in connection with a launch into space. This exemption from duty was provided for in Subheading 9808.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). Also, HTSUS, Chapter VIII, U.S. note 1, pursuant to the same law, provided that return of articles by NASA from space to the United States would not be considered an importation, and similarly not be subject to a duty.

    As a result of the Uruguay Round agreements of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this authority was revised and expanded in scope. It now provides that imports of articles for NASA's use and articles imported to implement NASA's international programs, including articles to be launched into space, parts thereof, ground support equipment, and uniquely associated equipment for use in connection with NASA's international programs and launch service agreements would be eligible for duty-free customs entry upon certification by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs. The revised authorities also provided, in U.S. note 1 to subchapter VIII of chapter 98 of the HTSUS, that articles brought into the customs territory of the United States by NASA from space or from a foreign country as part of a NASA's international programs would not be considered imports or subject to customs entry requirements.

      § 1221.108   Establishment of the NASA Unified Visual Communications System.

#### § § 1221.108

      (a) The NASA Administrator directed the establishment of a NASA Unified Visual Communications System. The system, which is comprised of the NASA Graphics Standards Manual and any accompanying style guides or related NASA directive or specification, was developed under the Federal Design Improvement Program initiated by the President in May 1972. This system is the Agency-wide program by which NASA projects a contemporary, business-like, progressive, and forward-looking image through the use of effective design for improved communications. The system provides a professional and cohesive NASA identity by imparting continuity of graphics design in all layout, reproduction art, stationery, forms, publications, signs, films, video productions, vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft markings and other items. It creates a unified image which is representative and symbolic of NASA's progressive attitudes and programs.

      (b) The Associate Administrator for Communications is responsible for the development and implementation of the NASA Graphics Standards Manual and any accompanying style guides for the Agency or related NASA directive or specification.

      (c) The Associate Administrator for Communications has designated staff to implement and monitor Agency-wide design improvements in consonance with the NASA Graphics Standards Manual. Designated staff will develop and issue changes and additions to the Manual as required and as new design standards and specifications are developed and approved. The NASA Graphics Standards Manual can be downloaded at .

      (d) NASA Centers and Headquarters have designated staff to implement NASA's graphics standards and ensure compliance of the NASA Graphics Standards Manual and any accompanying Style Guides or related NASA directive or specification.

#### § § 1230.101

    (a) Except as detailed in § 1230.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.

    (b) [Reserved]

    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.

    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.

    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.

    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the  or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.

    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.  Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the  or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.

    (j) Federal guidance on the requirements of this policy shall be issued only after consultation, for the purpose of harmonization (to the extent appropriate), with other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, unless such consultation is not feasible.

    § 1230.103   Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.

#### § § 1230.103

    (a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 1230.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 1230.103(d)).

    (b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.

    (c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.

    (d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 1230.101(i) or exempted under § 1230.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.

    (e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy ( in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).

    § 1230.104   Exempt research.

#### § § 1230.104

    (a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.

    (b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:

    (1)  Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.

    (2)  The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.

    (3)  The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:

    (1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.

    (2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1230.111(a)(7).

    (3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1230.111(a)(7).

    (ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.

    (iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.

    (4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;

    (ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;

    (iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or

    (iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501

    (5) Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of department or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or service programs, including procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs, possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures, or possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.

    (i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies:

    (i) If wholesome foods without additives are consumed, or

    (ii) If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (7) Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for potential secondary research use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by § 1230.111(a)(8).

    (8) Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following criteria are met:

    (i) Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens was obtained in accordance with § 1230.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent was obtained in accordance with § 1230.117;

    (iii) An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination required by § 1230.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and (iv) The investigator does not include returning individual research results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual research results.

    §§ 1230.105-1230.106   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 1230.105-1230.106

    § 1230.107   IRB membership.

#### § § 1230.107

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.

    (b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.

    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.

    (d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.

    (e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.

    § 1230.108   IRB functions and operations.

#### § § 1230.108

    (a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:

    (1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;

    (2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant;

    (3) Establish and follow written procedures for:

    (i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution;

    (ii) Determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and

    (iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the research activity in accordance with the terms of the IRB approval until any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.

    (4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency of

    (i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB; and

    (ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.

    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described in § 1230.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.

    § 1230.109   IRB review of research.

#### § § 1230.109

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities under § 1230.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption (under § 1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7), and (8)).

    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of informed consent is in accordance with § 1230.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in § 1230.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.

    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with § 1230.117.

    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.

    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research requiring review by the convened IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, not less than once per year, except as described in § 1230.109(f).

    (f)(1) Unless an IRB determines otherwise, continuing review of research is not required in the following circumstances:

    (i) Research eligible for expedited review in accordance with § 1230.110;

    (ii) Research reviewed by the IRB in accordance with the limited IRB review described in § 1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8);

    (iii) Research that has progressed to the point that it involves only one or both of the following, which are part of the IRB-approved study:

    (A) Data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, or

    (B) Accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care.

    (2) [Reserved]

    (g) An IRB shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.

    § 1230.110   Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

#### § § 1230.110

    (a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the  a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the  for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.

    (b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:

    (i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;

    (ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or

    (iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).

    (2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 1230.108(b).

    (c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.

    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.

    § 1230.111   Criteria for IRB approval of research.

#### § § 1230.111

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:

    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized:

    (i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and

    (ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.

    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research ( the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.

    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 1230.116.

    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 1230.117.

    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.

    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 1230.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:

    (i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 1230.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 1230.117; and

    (iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.

    § 1230.112   Review by Institution

#### § § 1230.112

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.

    § 1230.113   Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.

#### § § 1230.113

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

    § 1230.114   Cooperative Research.

#### § § 1230.114

    (a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.

    (b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.

    (2) The following research is not subject to this provision:

    (i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or

    (ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.

    (c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.

    § 1230.115   IRB Records.

#### § § 1230.115

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the following:

    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent forms, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.

    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings, which shall be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.

    (3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would not require continuing review as described in § 1230.109(f)(1).

    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the investigators.

    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described in § 1230.108(a)(2).

    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in § 1230.108(a)(3) and (4).

    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as required by § 1230.116(c)(5).

    (8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under § 1230.110(b)(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review list described in § 1230.110(a) is more than minimal risk.

    (9) Documentation specifying the responsibilities that an institution and an organization operating an IRB each will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, as described in § 1230.103(e).

    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The institution or IRB may maintain the records in printed form, or electronically. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the Federal department or agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

    § 1230.116   General Requirements for Informed Consent.

#### § § 1230.116

    (a)  General requirements for informed consent, whether written or oral, are set forth in this paragraph and apply to consent obtained in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Broad consent may be obtained in lieu of informed consent obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section only with respect to the storage, maintenance, and secondary research uses of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens. Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local officials is described in paragraph (e) of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy:

    (1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.

    (3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the legally authorized representative.

    (4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.

    (5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:

    (i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.

    (ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.

    (6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.

    (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:

    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures that are experimental;

    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject;

    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research;

    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;

    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;

    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained;

    § 1230.117   Documentation of informed consent.

#### § § 1230.117

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:

    (1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 1230.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 1230.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 1230.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.

    (c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:

    (i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;

    (ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or

    (iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

    (2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.

    § 1230.118   Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

#### § § 1230.118

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 1230.101(i) or exempted under § 1230.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.

    § 1230.119   Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.

#### § § 1230.119

    Except for research waived under § 1230.101(i) or exempted under § 1230.104, in the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.

    § 1230.120   Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.

#### § § 1230.120

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.

    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one.

    § 1230.121   [Reserved]

#### § § 1230.121

    § 1230.122   Use of Federal funds.

#### § § 1230.122

    Federal funds administered by a Federal department or agency may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements of this policy have been satisfied.

    § 1230.123   Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.

#### § § 1230.123

    (a) The department or agency head may require that Federal department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with the terms of this policy.

    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to federal regulation).

    § 1230.124   Conditions.

#### § § 1230.124

    With respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.

      § 1245.103   Policy.

#### § § 1245.103

      (a) In implementing the provisions of section 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. Chapter 201), and in determining when the interests of the United States would be served by waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in an invention or class of inventions made in the performance of work under NASA contracts, the Administrator will be guided by the objectives set forth in the National Aeronautics and Space Act, by the basic policy of the Presidential Memorandum and Statement of Government Patent Policy to the Heads of the Executive Departments and agencies dated February 18, 1983, by the goals and objectives of its current Authorization Act, Strategic Plan, and other pertinent National policies or laws, such as the National Space Policy of the United States of America. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Among the most important goals are to provide incentives to foster inventiveness and encourage the reporting of inventions made under NASA contracts, to provide for the widest practicable dissemination of new technology resulting from NASA programs, and to promote early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability of this new technology for commercial purposes and the public benefit. In applying this regulation, both the need for incentives to draw forth private initiatives and the need to promote healthy competition in industry must be weighed.

      (b) Several different situations arise when waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to an invention or class of invention may be requested and are prescribed in §§ 1245.104 through 1245.106. Under § 1245.104, advance waiver of any or all of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract may be requested prior to the execution of the contract, or within 30 days after execution of the contract. Waiver of rights to an identified invention made and reported under a contract are to be requested under § 1245.105, and may be requested under this provision even though a request under § 1245.104 was not made, or if made, was not granted. Waiver of foreign rights under § 1245.106 may be requested concurrently with domestic rights under § 1245.104 or § 1245.105, or may be made independently.

      (c) With respect to inventions which may be or are made or conceived in the course of or under contracts for research, development or demonstration work awarded by NASA on behalf of the Department of Energy (DOE) or in support of a DOE program, on a reimbursable basis pursuant to agreement between DOE and NASA, the waiver policy, regulations, and procedures of DOE will be applied. NASA will normally grant waiver of rights to inventions made under contracts awarded by NASA on behalf of, or in support of, programs funded by another Government agency, unless the funding agency recommends and justifies denial of the waiver. See §§ 1245.110(c) and 1245.111(b).

#### § § 1245.104

      (a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of domestic rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract.

      (b) The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights submitted prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract unless the Board finds that the interests of the United States will be better served by restricting or denying all or part of the requested rights in one or more of the following situations:

      (1) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business in the United States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;

      (2) When a determination has been made by Government authority which is authorized by statute or Executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence activities that the restriction or denial of the requested rights to any inventions made in the performance of work under the contract is necessary to protect the security of such activities; or

      (3) Where the Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that restriction or denial of the requested rights will better promote one or more of the following objectives:

      (i) Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research and development;

      (ii) Encouraging maximum participation of industry in federally-supported research and development;

      (iii) Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote free competition and enterprise;

      (iv) Promoting the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industry and labor; and

      (v) Ensuring that the Government retains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.

      (c)(1) An advance waiver, when granted, will be subject to the reservations set forth in § 1245.107. Normally, the reservations of § 1245.107(a), License to the Government, and § 1245.107(b), March-in rights, will apply. However, should one or more of the situations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3), of this section exist, rather than denying the advance waiver request, the Board may recommend granting to the contractor only part of the requested rights, to the extent necessary to address the particular situation, consistent with the policy and goals of § 1245.103. In that event, the waiver grant will be subject to additional reservations as provided for in § 1245.107(c).

      (2) To meet the National Aeronautics and Space Act standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” for advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention(s) and/or class(es) of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver of rights is being requested. Therefore, the petition must be directed to a specific invention(s) or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly drawn, focused area(s) of technology.

      (3) An advance waiver, when granted, will apply only to inventions reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and a designation made within 6 months of the time of reporting (or a reasonable time thereafter permitted for good cause shown) that the contractor elects title to the invention and intends to file or has filed a U.S. patent application. Such election will be made by notification in writing to the patent representative designated in the contract. Title to all other inventions made under the contract are subject to section 20135(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51 U.S.C. 20135(b)(1). The granting of the advance waiver does not otherwise relieve a contractor of any of the invention identification or reporting requirements set forth in the applicable patent rights clause in the contract.

      (4) The advance waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in any patent application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the reported invention.

      (d) When a petition for waiver is submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, prior to contract execution, it will be processed expeditiously so that a decision on the petition may be reached prior to execution of the contract. However, if there is insufficient time or insufficient information is presented, or for other reasons which do not permit a recommendation to be made without unduly delaying execution of the contract, the Board will inform the contracting officer that no recommendation can be made prior to contract execution and the reasons therefor. The contracting officer will then notify the petitioner of the Board's action.

      (e) A waiver granted pursuant to a petition submitted under this section shall extend to any contract changes, modifications, or supplemental agreements, so long as the purpose of the contract or the scope of work to be performed is not substantially changed.

      § 1245.105   Waiver after reporting inventions.

#### § § 1245.105

      (a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of domestic rights to identified inventions which have been reported to NASA and to which a waiver of rights has not been granted pursuant to § 1245.104.

      (b)(1) When an individual identified invention has been reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and waiver of rights has not been granted under § 1245.104, the Board normally will recommend grant of a request for waiver of domestic rights to such invention if the request is received within 8 months of first disclosure to NASA (or such longer period that the Board may permit for good cause shown), unless the Board finds that one or more of the situations set forth in § 1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v) exist. When granted, the waiver will be subject to the reservations set forth in § 1245.107 in the same manner as discussed in § 1245.104(c)(1).

      (2) The waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in the patent application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the reported invention.

      § 1245.106   Waiver of foreign rights.

#### § § 1245.106

      (a) The Board will consider the waiver of foreign rights in any designated country concurrently with the waiver of domestic rights when so requested under § 1245.104 or § 1245.105.

      (b) The Board will also consider a separate request for foreign rights for an individual identified invention in any designated country if a request was not made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or for countries not designated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The Board will normally recommend the waiver of foreign rights be granted under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section in any designated country unless:

      (1) The Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that restriction or denial of the requested foreign rights will better promote one or more of the objectives set forth in § 1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v); or

      (2) The Board finds that the economic interests of the United States will not be served thereby; or unless

      (3) In the case of an individual identified invention under paragraph (b) of this section, NASA has determined, prior to the request, to file a patent application in the designated country.

      (d) If, subsequent to the granting of the petition for foreign rights, the petitioner requests and designates additional countries in which it wishes to secure patents, the Chairperson may recommend such request, in whole or in part, without further action by the Board.

      § 1245.107   Reservations.

#### § § 1245.107

      (a)  Any invention for which waiver of domestic or foreign rights has been granted under this subpart shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of the invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States.

      (b)  For any invention for which waiver of rights has been granted under this subpart, NASA has the same right as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210, with the procedures set forth in § 1245.117 and 37 CFR 401.6, to require the contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if NASA determines that:

      (1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in such field of use;

      (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;

      (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or

      (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by the “Preference for United States industry” has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

      (c)  In the event one or more of the situations set forth in § 1245.104 (b)(1) through (b)(3) exist, the Board may determine to recommend partial grant of the waiver request (rather than denial) by making the grant subject to additional reservations (than those set forth in (a) and (b) of this section) to the extent necessary to address the particular situation. Such additional reservations may include, but not be limited to, field-of-use or terrestrial-use limitations, or additions to the march-in rights.

      § 1245.108   License to contractor.

#### § § 1245.108

      (a) Each contractor reporting an invention is granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on the invention and in any resulting patent in which the Government acquires title. The license extends to the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right is transferable only with the approval of the Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

      (b) The contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with the Licensing of Government-Owned Inventions (37 CFR part 404). This license will not be revoked in that field of use and/or the geographical areas in which the contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention available to the public on reasonable terms. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the Administrator to the extent the contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.

      (c) Before revocation or modification of the license, the contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the contractor will be allowed 30 days (or any other time as may be allowed by the Administrator for good cause shown by the contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The contractor shall have the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.

#### § § 1245.109

      (a) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to the domestic title to any invention for which a patent application has not been filed within 1 year (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from notification to NASA of election of title, as required by § 1245.104(c)(2), for an advanced waiver pursuant to § 1245.104, or within 1 year from the granting of a waiver for an individual invention granted pursuant to § 1245.105.

      (b) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to title in any foreign country for which waiver has been granted pursuant to § 1245.106, if a patent application has not been filed in that country (or in the European Patent Office or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and that country designated) within either 10 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a corresponding U.S. patent application has been filed or 6 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a license is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

      (c) In any country in which the waiver recipient decides not to continue prosecution of any application, to pay maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceedings on a patent on a waived invention, the waiver recipient shall notify the patent representative within sufficient time for NASA to continue prosecution, pay the maintenance fee or defend the reexamination or opposition, and upon written request, convey title to NASA and execute all papers necessary for NASA to proceed with the appropriate action.

      § 1245.110   Content of petitions.

#### § § 1245.110

      (a) Each request for waiver of domestic or foreign rights under § 1245.104, § 1245.105, or § 1245.106 shall be by petition to the Administrator and shall include:

      (8) The name, address, and telephone number of the party with whom the Board is to communicate when the request is acted upon;

      (9) Whether the petitioner is an entity of or under the control of a foreign government;

      (10) The signature of the petitioner or its authorized representative; and

      (11) The date of the petition.

      (b) Advance waiver petitions shall also identify the invention(s) and/or class(es) of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver of rights is being requested, in accordance with § 1245.104(c)(2).

      (c) No specific forms need be used. Requests for advanced waiver should, preferably, be included with the proposal, but in any event in advance of negotiations.

      (d)  The content of the petitions for waiver of title to inventions made under contracts awarded by NASA on behalf of the Department of Energy under § 1245.103(c) shall follow the procedures and form prescribed by and shall be acted on by that agency. Petitions under contracts awarded by NASA on behalf of other agencies will be coordinated with the agency before action is taken by the Board.

#### § § 1245.116

      (a)  In order to protect the interests of the Government and the petitioner in inventions, a petitioner may file United States patent applications for such inventions prior to the Administrator's determination on a petition for waiver. If an application on an identified invention is filed during the pendency of the petition, or within 60 days prior to the receipt of a petition, NASA will reimburse the petitioner for any reasonable costs of the filing and patent prosecution that may have occurred,

      (1) Similar patent filing and prosecution costs are not normally reimbursed to the petitioner as direct or indirect costs chargeable to the Government contracts;

      (2) The petition is ultimately denied with respect to domestic rights, or with respect to foreign and domestic rights, if both are requested, and

      (3) Prior to reimbursement, petitioner assigns the application to the United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

      (b)  The waiver recipient shall include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon for a waived invention, the following statement:

      The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under NASA Contract No. lll, and is subject to the provisions of Section 20135 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. Chapter 201).

      (c)  The waiver recipient shall return to NASA a duly executed and approved license to the Government (which will be prepared by the Government) fully confirming of all the rights, domestic and foreign, to which the Government is entitled.

      (d)  The waiver recipient shall furnish to either the Chairperson or the patent representative, the filing date, serial number and title, and upon request, a copy of any domestic or foreign patent application including an English language version if filed in a language other than English, and a copy of the patent or patent number and issue date, for any waived invention.

      (e)  The waiver recipient shall notify the Chairperson prior to any transfer of principal rights in any waived invention to any party. Such transfer shall be subject to all rights reserved by the Government, and all obligations of the waiver recipient, as set forth in this subpart.

      (f)  (1) The waiver recipient shall provide to the Chairperson upon request, and no more frequently than annually, reports on the utilization of a waived invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization being made by the waiver recipient or its licensees or assigns. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of the development, date of first commercial sale or use, and such other data and information as the Chairperson may reasonably specify.

      (6) As an alternative to paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, certification that the claimant has made a bona fide attempt to determine the accused subject matter, which is alleged to infringe the patent(s), or the accused subject matter alleged to infringe the copyright(s), but was unable to do so, giving reasons and stating a reasonable basis for the claimant's belief that the patent(s) or copyright(s) is being infringed.

      (b)  In addition to the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the following material and information generally are necessary in the course of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are encouraged to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to permit rapid processing and resolution of the claim.

      (1) A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all claims of the patent(s) alleged to be infringed.

      (2) Identification of all procurements known to the claimants that involve the accused item(s) or process(es), including the identity of the vendor(s) or contractor(s) and the Government acquisition activity or activities.

      (3) A detailed identification and description of the accused article(s) or process(es) used or acquired by the Government, particularly where the article(s) or process(es) relate to a component(s) or subcomponent(s) of an item acquired, and an element-by-element comparison of representative claim(s) with the accused article(s) or process(es). If available, the identification and description should include documentation and drawings to illustrate the accused article(s) or process(es) in sufficient detail to enable determining whether the claim(s) of the asserted patent(s) read on the accused article(s) or process(es).

In addition, the status of all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications and full copies of the same.

      (11) Pertinent prior art known to the claimant not contained in the USPTO file, for example, publications and foreign prior art. In addition to the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused article(s) or process(es) or to a specific acquisition (e.g. identified contract(s)), it may speed disposition of the claim. Claimants are also encouraged to provide information on any ancillary matters that may have a bearing on validity or infringement.

      (c)  In the course of investigating a claim, it may become necessary for NASA to request information in the control and custody of the claimant that is relevant to the disposition of the claim. Failure of the claimant to respond to a request for such information shall be sufficient reason alone for denying a claim.

    § 1250.103   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1250.103

    § 1250.103-1   General.

#### § § 1250.103-1

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.

    § 1250.103-2   Specific discriminatory acts prohibited.

#### § § 1250.103-2

    (a) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or national origin:

    (1) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

    (2) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;

    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.

    (4) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

    (5) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

    (7) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in § 1250.103-3).

    (b) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

    § 1250.103-3   Employment practices.

#### § § 1250.103-3

    (a) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (1) to assist such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (2) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals.

    (b) Employment opportunities provided in connection with any of the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A, which opportunities are limited, or for which preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training for the same or related employments, are programs of the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (c) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.

    (d) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.

    § 1250.103-4   Illustrative applications.

#### § § 1250.103-4

    (a) In training grant services discrimination is forbidden in the selection or eligibility of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In any case where selection is made from a predetermined group, such as the students in an institution, the group must have been selected without discrimination.

    (b) In a research or training grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited and the prohibition extends to the entire university.

    (c) Discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.

    (d) In a research or training grant, discrimination is prohibited with respect to the availability of any educational activity and any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the grant.

    (e) Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or educational uses, discrimination is forbidden to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.

    (f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 1250.105 to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.

    (g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.

    § 1250.103-5   Special benefits.

#### § § 1250.103-5

    An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion from the benefits limited by Federal law to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin different from his.

#### § § 1250.103-6

    Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 1250.103 to 1250.103-5, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with § 1250.103-1, if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with § 1250.103-1.

    § 1250.104   Assurances.

#### § § 1250.104

    (a)  Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain, be accompanied by, or identify and make reference to, an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. If the assurance is not made a part of the application, the application shall identify the assurance which is applicable to the application. One assurance shall suffice for all applications of an applicant if the assurance complies with the conditions made applicable by this part to each such application for Federal financial assistance. Every assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.

    (b)  The period of time to be covered by the assurances required under this § 1250.104 shall be as follows:

    (1)  In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance for providing real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

    (2)  In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance for providing personal property, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property.

    (3)  In the case of an application for any other kind of Federal financial assistance, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application.

    (c)  (1) In the case of application by an institution of higher education or any other organization for Federal financial assistance for a program or activity which involves participation by students, fellows or trainees, including but not limited to assistance for research, training, or the provision of facilities, the assurance required by this § 1250.104 shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students or other participants.

    (2) The assurances from such an applicant shall be applicable to the entire organization of the applicant.

    (d)  In the case of assistance for the construction of a facility, or part thereof, the assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of research, training, or educational services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be forbidden as a condition of grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. Also, see paragraph (c) of this section for the requirement as to the applicability of the assurance to the applicant's organization.

    (e)  The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible NASA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee.

    (f)  Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).

    (g)  The responsible NASA officials shall specify the form of assurances required by this § 1250.104 and the extent to which like assurances will be required by subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program.

    (h)  Any request for proposals issued by NASA which relates to covered financial assistance listed in appendix A shall have set forth therein or have attached thereto the assurance prescribed in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and shall require that the proposer either include the assurance as a part of his signed proposal or identify and refer to an assurance already signed and submitted by the proposer.

    § 1250.105   Compliance information.

#### § § 1250.105

    (a)  Each responsible NASA official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

    (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

    (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and that agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

    (d)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the Principal Compliance Officer finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protection against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

    § 1250.106   Conduct of investigations.

#### § § 1250.106

    (a)  The responsible NASA official or his designee shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.

    (b)  Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee.

    (c)  The Principal Compliance Officer or his designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.

    (d)  (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 1250.107.

    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible NASA official or his designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

    (e)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

    § 1250.107   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 1250.107

    (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

    (b)  If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 1250.104 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. NASA shall not be obligated to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such subsection except that NASA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.

    (c)  No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible NASA official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Administrator pursuant to § 1250.109(e), and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Administrator has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

    (d)  No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the Principal Compliance Officer has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

    § 1250.108   Hearings.

#### § § 1250.108

    (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1250.107(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Principal Compliance Officer that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1250.107(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

    (b)  Hearings shall be held at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the Principal Compliance Officer unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of NASA requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the Administrator, or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act).

    (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and NASA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

    (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (section 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both NASA and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

    (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute non-compliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or non-compliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Administrator may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with the part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1250.109.

> [30 FR 301, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17937, July 5, 1973; 68 FR 51350, Aug. 26, 2003]

    § 1250.109   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 1250.109

    (a)  If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Principal Compliance Officer for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the Principal Compliance Officer his exceptions to the initial decision with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Principal Compliance Officer may on his own motion, within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the Principal Compliance Officer shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the Principal Compliance Officer.

    (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the Principal Compliance Officer for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the Administrator conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Principal Compliance Officer shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.

    (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1250.108, a decision shall be made by the Principal Compliance Officer on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

    (d)  Each decision of a hearing officer or the Principal Compliance Officer shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

    (e)  Any final decision of the NASA Principal Compliance Officer which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Administrator, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.

    (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its non-compliance and satisfies the Principal Compliance Officer that it will fully comply with this part.

    (g)  (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.

    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Principal Compliance Officer to restore fully the eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Principal Compliance Officer determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.

    (3) If the Principal Compliance Officer denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the Principal Compliance Officer. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

    § 1250.111   Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

#### § § 1250.111

    (a)  All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of NASA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this Instruction. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof): (1) Executive Orders 10925 and 11246 and regulations or instructions issued thereunder, or (2) any other regulations or instructions, insofar as such other regulations or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.

    (b)  Each responsible NASA official shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as applied to financial assistance to which this part applies and for which he is responsible.

    (c)  The Administrator may assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government, with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 1250.109), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within NASA and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action has been taken by the responsible official of this agency.

      § 1251.100   Purpose and broad coverage.

#### § § 1251.100

      (a)  This part effectuates section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

      (b)  Consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008's purpose (ADA Amendments Act) of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA and section 504, the definition of “disability” applicable to this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this part. The primary object of attention in cases brought under this part should be whether entities covered under section 504 have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.

      § 1251.103   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1251.103

      (a)  No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.

      (b)  (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefits, or services, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability:

      (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

      (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

      (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others;

      (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

      (v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;

      (vi) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

      (vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.

      (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities, but must afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.

      (3) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that no individual with disability is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance because of the absence of auxiliary aids for individuals with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

      (4) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not separate or different.

      (5) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:

      (i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination of the basis of disability;

#### § § 1251.104

      (a)  An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified by the Associate Administrator, that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to NASA.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

      (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

      (3) In all other cases, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

      (c)  (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from NASA, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

      (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.

      (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from NASA, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Associate Administrator may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

      (iii) With respect to individuals with disabilities presently in the program or activity, but not receiving full benefits or equal and integrated treatment within the program or activity.

      (b)  A recipient may take steps, in addition to any action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity by qualified individuals with disabilities.

      (c)  (1) A recipient shall, within 1 year of the effective date of this part; or within 1 year of first becoming a recipient:

#### § § 1251.109

      (a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any state or local law or other requirement that, on the basis of disability, imposes prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.

      (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for individuals with disabilities than for individuals without disabilities.

      (a) This part does not require a recipient to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, programs, or activities of that recipient when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.

      (b) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, a recipient must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable accommodations in policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.

      § 1251.111   Reasonable accommodation.

#### § § 1251.111

      A recipient shall make reasonable accommodations in policies, practices, or procedures when such accommodations are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the recipient can demonstrate that making the accommodations would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or result in an undue financial and administrative burden.

      (c) This section does not require the recipient to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where the recipient believes that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the recipient has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1251.112 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the chief executive officer of the recipient or his or her designee after considering all of the recipient's resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the recipient shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      § 1251.549   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1251.549

      Except as otherwise provided in § 1251.550, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

      § 1251.550   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1251.550

      (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not—

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;

      (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the Agency to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance of historic properties.

      (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1251.550(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1251.550(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1251.550(a)(2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

      (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

      (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

      (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

      (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

      (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

      (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

      (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.

      (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

      (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

      (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1251.560 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    Subpart 1252.2—Standards for Determining Age Discrimination

      § 1252.200   Rules against age discrimination.

#### § § 1252.200

      The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions contained in § 1252.201.

      (a)  No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

      (b)  A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements use age distinctions or take any other actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:

      (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or

      (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

      (c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.

      § 1252.201   Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.

#### § § 1252.201

      (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms  and  shall have the following meaning:

      (1)  means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.

      (2)  means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal statute, state statute or local statute or ordinance adopted by any elected, general purpose legislative body.

      (b) Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1252.200 if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation of the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:

      (1) Age is used as a measure of approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

      (2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

      (3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

      (4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.

      (c) Reasonable factors other than age. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1252.200 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

      § 1252.202   Burden of proof.

#### § § 1252.202

      The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in § 1252.201 (b) and (c) is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.

      § 1252.203   Special benefits for children and the elderly.

#### § § 1252.203

      If a recipient operating a program or activity provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program or activity, notwithstanding the provision of § 1252.10.

      (2) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the NASA regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.

      § 1252.303   Information requirements.

      § 1252.400   Compliance reviews.

#### § § 1252.400

      (a) NASA may conduct compliance reviews and pre-award reviews of recipients or use other similar procedures that will permit it to investigate and correct violations of the Act and these regulations. NASA may conduct these reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of these regulations has occurred.

      (b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, NASA will attempt to secure the recipient's voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, NASA will arrange for enforcement as described in § 1252.405.

      § 1252.401   Complaints.

#### § § 1252.401

      (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with NASA, alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or these regulations based on an action occurring on or after July 1, 1979. A complaint must be filed within 180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, NASA may extend this time limit.

      (b) NASA will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:

      (1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement, which identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action or practice complained of, and assigned by the complainant.

      (2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.

      (3) Widely disseminating information regarding the obligations of recipients under the Act and these regulations.

      (4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure.

      (5) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact NASA for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.

      (c) NASA will return to the complainant any complaint outside the jurisdiction of these regulations, and will state the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of these regulations.

      (1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and these regulations; and

      (2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.

      (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at least one meeting with the mediator before NASA will accept a judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

      (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to NASA. NASA will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement. However, NASA retains the right to monitor the recipient's compliance with the agreement.

      (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.

      (e) NASA will use the mediation process for a maximum of 60 days after receiving a complaint.

      (f) Mediation ends if:

      (1) 60 days elapse from the time NASA receives the complaint; or

      (2) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, an agreement is reached; or

      (3) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached.

      (g) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to NASA.

      § 1252.403   Investigation.

#### § § 1252.403

      (a)  (1) NASA will investigate complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement.

      (2) As part of the initial inquiry, NASA will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. NASA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

      (3) NASA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at NASA.

      (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of NASA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.

      (5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

      (b)  If NASA cannot resolve the complaint through informal means it will develop formal findings through further investigations of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, NASA will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. If NASA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 1252.405.

      § 1252.404   Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

#### § § 1252.404

      A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation against any person who:

      (a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or these regulations; or

      (b) Cooperates in any mediation, inquiry, hearing, or other part of NASA's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.

      § 1252.405   Compliance procedure.

#### § § 1252.405

      (a) NASA may enforce the Act and these regulations through:

      (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from NASA under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from NASA.

      (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:

      (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations.

      (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.

      (b) NASA will limit any termination under § 1252.405(a)(1) to the particular program or activity NASA finds in violations of these regulations. NASA will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from NASA.

      (c) NASA will take no action under paragraph (a) until:

      (1) The Administrator has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

      (2) 30 days have elapsed after the Administrator has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Administrator will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d) NASA also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from NASA to a recipient when a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1) is initiated.

      (1) New Federal financial assistance from NASA includes all assistance for which NASA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from NASA does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1).

      (2) NASA will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1). NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Administrator. NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.

#### § § 1252.408

      (a) Where NASA finds a recipient has discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action that NASA may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, NASA may require both recipients to take remedial action.

      (b) Even in the absence of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipients program or activity on the basis of age.

      (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint.

      (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Administrator, the Attorney General of the United States, and

      (iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and, whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

      (a)  Either at the application stage or the award stage, Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial assistance or awards of Federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each education program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 1253.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.

      (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

      (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

      (c)  (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).

      (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.

      § 1253.120   Transfers of property.

#### § § 1253.120

      If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 1253.205 through 1253.235(a).

      § 1253.125   Effect of other requirements.

#### § § 1253.125

      (a)  The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e ); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.

      (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

      (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

      § 1253.130   Effect of employment opportunities.

#### § § 1253.130

      The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

#### § § 1253.135

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 1253.300 through 1253.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 1253.135, or to the designated agency official.

      (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

      (i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such recipient; and

      (ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every student and employee of such recipient.

      (b)  (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form that it makes available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment of students or employees.

      (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by these Title IX regulations.

      (c)  Each recipient shall distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall apprise each of its admission and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall require such representatives to adhere to such policy.

      (2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission that has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria that do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.

      (c)  In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 1253.300 through 1253.310 apply:

      (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;

With respect to physical education classes and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

      (2) This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex.

      (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.

      (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.

Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

      (c)  Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.

      (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.

      (b)  (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein;  that the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.

      (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:

      (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;

      (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

      (c)  (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.

      (a)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to any of its students:

      (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and

      (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.

      (b)  A recipient that employs any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates §§ 1253.500 through 1253.550.

      (b)  (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.

      (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

      (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

      (4) Subject to § 1253.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

      (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

      § 1253.450   Athletics.

#### § § 1253.450

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

      (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

      (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

      (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

      (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;

      (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

      (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

      (x) Publicity.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

      (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

      (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of these Title IX regulations.

The dates of beginning and ending of such an armed conflict are the dates established by concurrent resolution of the Congress or by a determination of the President.

      § 1261.104   Allowable claims.

#### § § 1261.104

      (a) A claim may be allowed only if:

      (b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.

      (c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with NASA may be considered and allowed.

#### § § 1261.106

      All claims shall be submitted in duplicate to the Administrator or designee on NASA Form 1204, “Employee's Claim for Damage to, or Loss of, Personal Property Incident to Service.”

      § 1261.107   Evidence in support of claim.

#### § § 1261.107

      (a)  In addition to the information required on NASA Form 1204, and any other evidence required by the Administrator or designee, the claimant will furnish the following evidence when relevant:

      (1) A corroborating statement from the claimant's supervisor or other person or persons having personal knowledge of the facts concerning the claim.

      (2) A statement of any property recovered or replaced in kind.

      (3) An itemized bill of repair for property which has been repaired, or one or more written estimates of the cost of repairs from competent persons if the property is repairable but has not been repaired.

      (b)  Claims of the following types shall also be accompanied with specific and detailed evidence as indicated:

      (1)  A statement describing in detail the location where the loss occurred and the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss, including supporting documentation, e.g., a police report.

      (2)  A copy of orders authorizing the travel, transportation or shipment, or a certificate explaining the absence of such orders and stating their substance; all bills of lading and inventories of property shipped; and a statement indicating the condition of the property when turned over to the carrier and when received from the carrier.

      § 1261.108   Recovery from carriers, insurers, and other third parties.

#### § § 1261.108

      (a)  NASA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from NASA. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for personal property loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim.

      (b)  When it appears that property has been damaged or lost under circumstances in which a carrier, warehouse owner/operator, contractor or insurer may be responsible, the claimant shall make a written demand on such party, either before or after submitting a claim against NASA. The Administrator or designee, if requested, will assist in making demand on the third party. No such demand need be made if, in the opinion of the Administrator or designee, it would be impracticable or any recovery would be insignificant, or if circumstances preclude the claimant from making timely demand.

      (c)  A copy of the demand and of any related correspondence shall be submitted to the Administrator or designee. If the carrier, insurer, or other third party offers a settlement which is less than the amount of the demand, the claimant shall consult with the Administrator or designee before accepting the amount offered. The claimant shall also notify the Administrator or designee promptly of any other action by a third party, including settlement, partial settlement, or denial of liability.

      (d)  When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation is allowable under this subpart. When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of total loss subject to the maximum set forth in § 1261.102.

      (e)  The claimant shall assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment accepted on a claim, all rights, title, and interest in any claim he/she may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the accident or incident on which the claim against the United States is based. The claimant shall also, upon request, furnish such evidence and other cooperation as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim. After payment on the claim by the United States, the claimant shall, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier, insurer, or other party, notify the Administrator or designee and pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent required under the provisions of paragraph (d).

      § 1261.109   Computation of allowance.

#### § § 1261.109

      (a) The amount allowed for damage to or loss of any item of property may not exceed the cost of the item (either the price paid in cash or property, or the value at the time of acquisition if not acquired by purchase or exchange). There will be no allowance for replacement cost or for appreciation in the value of the property. Subject to these limitations, the amount allowable is either:

      (1) The depreciated value, immediately prior to the loss or damage of property lost or damaged beyond economical repair, less any salvage value; or

      (2) The reasonable cost of repairs, when property is economically repairable: Provided, That the cost of repairs does not exceed the amount allowable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (b) Depreciation in value is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, its condition when damaged or lost, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of damage or loss, with appropriate recognition of current replacement value.

      (c)  No more than 10 per centum of the amount paid in settlement of each individual claim submitted and settled shall be paid or delivered to or received by an agent or attorney on account of services rendered in connection with that claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding (31 U.S.C. 243).

      § 1261.110   Settlement of claims.

#### § § 1261.110

      (a)  (1) Claims in the amount of $5,000 or more will be acted upon by the General Counsel. Claims less than $5,000 will be acted upon by the Chief Counsel of the NASA Field Installation where the employee was assigned at the time of the loss or damage or the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation for NASA Headquarters claims.

      (2) Claims arising for $5,000 or more shall be investigated by the Chief Counsel or Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, as appropriate, and a report and recommendation thereon shall be forwarded to the General Counsel.

      (b)  (1) For each claim, the settlement official shall complete a report in duplicate on NASA Form 1204 and retain a claim file consisting of the original claim, the report, and any other relevant evidence or documents.

      (2) When a claim is allowed in an amount acceptable to the claimant, the settlement official shall prepare a “Voucher for Payment of Employees' Personal Property Claims” (NASA Form 1220), have it properly executed by the claimant, and forward it with a copy of the approved claim (NASA Form 1204) to the appropriate NASA fiscal or financial management office for payment.

      (3) When a claim is disallowed or is partially allowed in an amount unacceptable to the claimant, the settlement official shall notify the claimant in writing of the action taken and the reasons therefor. If not satisfied with the action taken, the claimant may, within 60 days after receipt of such notice, request reconsideration of the claim and may submit any new evidence that he/she feels to be pertinent to the claim. If such a claim has been disallowed at the field installation level, the claimant may request reconsideration by the field installation, or by the General Counsel, or both.

      (c)  The settlement of a claim under this subpart, whether by full or partial allowance or disallowance, is final and conclusive.

    Subpart 1261.3—Claims Against NASA or Its Employees for Damage to or Loss of Property or Personal Injury or Death—Accruing On or After January 18, 1967

**Authority:** Authority: 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680, 51 U.S.C. 20113(m), and 28 CFR part 14.

      § 1261.300   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 1261.300

      This subpart sets forth the procedures for:

      (a) The submission of, and action by NASA upon, claims against the United States arising out of the activities of NASA for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death, and designates the NASA officials authorized to act upon such claims.

      (b) The handling of lawsuits against NASA employee(s) for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death resulting from a NASA employee's activities within the scope of his/her office or employment.

      § 1261.301   Authority.

#### § § 1261.301

      (a) Under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended (see 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680), and subject to its limitations, the Administrator or designee is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any NASA employee while acting within the scope of his/her office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. In exercising such authority, the Administrator or designee is required to act in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General (28 CFR part 14). An award, compromise, or settlement in excess of $25,000 may be effected only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or designee.

      (b) Under 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(1), NASA is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, settle, and pay, on behalf of the United States, in full satisfaction thereof, any claim for $25,000 or less against the United States for bodily injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property resulting from the conduct of NASA's functions as specified in 51 U.S.C. 20112. At the discretion of NASA, a claim may be settled and paid under this authority even though the United States could not be held legally liable to the claimant.

      (c) Under 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(2), if NASA considers that a claim in excess of $25,000 is meritorious and would otherwise be covered by 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(1), NASA may report the facts and circumstances of the claim to the Congress for its consideration or to the Comptroller General as provided in the “Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1978,” Public Law 95-240 (92 Stat. 107), 31 U.S.C. 724a.

      (d) Under 28 U.S.C. 2679, the Attorney General of the United States shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against a Government employee for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death, resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle by the Government employee while acting within the scope of office or employment. In effect, this legislation is designed to protect an employee driving a motor vehicle on Government business by converting such a civil court action or proceeding against the employee into a claim against the United States: Provided, That the employee was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident. The remedy against the United States provided by 28 U.S.C. 2672 (administrative adjustment of claims) and 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) (civil action against the United States) then becomes the plaintiff's exclusive remedy.

      § 1261.406   Aggressive collection action; documentation.

#### § § 1261.406

      (a) NASA shall take aggressive action, on a timely basis with effective followup, to collect all claims of the United States for money or property arising out of NASA activities, and to cooperate with the other Federal agencies in debt collection activities.

      (b) All administrative collection action shall be documented and the bases for compromise, or for termination or suspension of collection action, should be set out in detail. Such documentation, including the Claims Collection Litigation Report under § 1261.417(e), should be retained in the appropriate claims file.

      § 1261.407   Demand for payment; limitation periods.

#### § § 1261.407

      (a) Appropriate written demands shall be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of demand letters, NASA will give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, if necessary to refer the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, such referral can be made within one year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When necessary to protect the Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions, including immediate referral for litigation.

      (b) The initial demand letter should inform the debtor of:

      (1) The basis for the indebtedness and whatever rights the debtor may have to seek review within the agency;

      (2) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (§ 1261.412); and

      (3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand delivered. The responsible official should exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand delivered on the same day that they are actually dated. Apart from these requirements, there is no prescribed format for demand letters. However, as appropriate to the circumstances, the responsible official may consider including, either in the initial demand letter or in subsequent letters, such items the NASA's willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment, or intentions with respect to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation.

      (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within the Agency.

      (c) NASA should respond promptly to communications from the debtor, within 30 days whenever feasible, and should advise debtors who dispute the debt to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.

      (d) If either prior to the initiation of, any time during, or after completion of the demand cycle, a determination to pursue offset is made, then the procedures specified in subparts 1261.5 and 1261.6, as applicable, should be followed. The availability of funds for offset and NASA's determination to pursue it release the agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. If the agency has not already sent the first demand letter, the agency's written notification of its intent to offset must give the debtor the opportunity to make voluntary payment, a requirement which will be satisfied by compliance with the notice requirements of § 1261.502 or § 1261.603(a), as applicable.

      (e) NASA should undertake personal interviews with its debtors whenever this is feasible, having regard for the amounts involved and the proximity of agency representatives to such debtors; and may attempt to effect compromise of the claim in accordance with § 1261.414.

      (f) When a debtor is employed by the Federal government or is a member of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with subpart 1261.6, the employing agency will be contacted for the purpose of arranging with the debtor for payment of the indebtedness by allotment or otherwise in accordance with section 206 of Executive Order 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469, which provides that: “An employee is expected to meet all just financial obligations, especially those—such as Federal, State, or local taxes—which are imposed by law” (4 CFR 102.81).

      § 1261.408   Use of consumer reporting agency.

#### § § 1261.408

      (a) The term  has the meaning provided in the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3)):

      (1) A consumer reporting agency as that term is defined in section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f); or

      (2) A person that, for money or on a cooperative basis, regularly—

      (i) Gets information on consumers to give the information to a consumer reporting agency; or

      (ii) Serves as a marketing agent under an arrangement allowing a third party to get the information from a consumer reporting agency.

      (b) NASA Headquarters Financial Management Division, shall be the focal contact between NASA and consumer reporting agencies. The following procedures shall apply when such agencies are employed by NASA:

      (1) After the appropriate notice pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) has been published, NASA may disclose, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12), information about a debtor to a consumer reporting agency. Such information may include:

      (i) That a claim has been determined to be valid and is overdue (including violation by debtor of a repayment plan or other claim settlement agreement);

      (ii) If a current address is available, notifying the individual by certified mail, return receipt requested, that: The designated NASA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid and overdue; within not less than 60 days after sending this notice, NASA intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency the specific information to be disclosed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; the individual may request a complete explanation of the claim, dispute the information in the records of NASA about the claim, and file for an administrative review or repeal of the claim or for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.

      (iii) Amount, status, and history of the claim;

      (iv) Program or pertinent activity under which the claim arose.

      (2) Before disclosing the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, NASA shall comply with 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) by:

      (i) Taking reasonable action to locate the individual if a current address is not available;

      (ii) If a current address is available, noticing the individual by certified mail, return receipt requested, that: The designated NASA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid and overdue; within not less than 60 days after sending this notice, NASA intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency the specific information to be disclosed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; the individual may request a complete explanation of the claim, dispute the information in the records of NASA about the claim, and file for an administrative review or repeal of the claim or for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.

      (3) If an administrative review or reconsideration is requested, the responsible official or designee shall refer the request to the appropriate NASA legal counsel for an impartial review and determination by counsel or designee based on the entire written record. If the reviewer cannot resolve the question of indebtedness based upon the available documentary evidence, verified written statements by the debtor or the responsible official may be requested on any pertinent matter not addressed by the available record.

      (c) If the information is to be submitted to a consumer reporting agency, the responsible official shall obtain a verified statement from such agency which gives satisfactory assurances that the particular agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information; and thereafter ensure that the consumer reporting agency is promptly informed of any substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim, or, on request of such agency, promptly verify or correct information about the claim.

      § 1261.409   Contracting for collection services.

#### § § 1261.409

      (a) When NASA determines that there is a need to contract for collection services, the following conditions shall apply:

      (1) The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection action, and refer the matter for litigation must be retained by NASA.

      (2) The contractor shall be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices—for example, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692), and 26 U.S.C. 6103(p)(4) and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service;

      (3) The contractor must be required to account strictly for all amounts collected; and

      (4) The contractor must agree to provide any data contained in its files relating to collection actions and related reports, current address of debtor, and reasonably current credit information upon returning an account to NASA for subsequent referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.

      (5) The debt must not be subject to mandatory transfer to the Department of the Treasury for collection. See 31 CFR 901.5(a) and (b).

      (b) NASA shall use Government-wide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. See 31 CFR 901.5(b).

      (c) NASA shall fund private collection contractor contracts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728(d) or as otherwise permitted by law. See 31 CFR 901.5(c).

> [45 FR 48104, July 18, 1980, as amended at 82 FR 29385, June 29, 2017]

      § 1261.410   Suspension or revocation of license or eligibility; liquidation of collateral.

#### § § 1261.410

      (a) In seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts provided for as an enforcement aid or for compelling compliance, NASA will give serious consideration to the suspension or revocation of licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated failure of a debtor to pay such a claim. In the case of a contractor under 48 CFR chapter 18, NASA will comply with the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility requirements of the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NASA/FAR Supplement) at 48 CFR 1809.4. Likewise, in making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in loans, NASA will give serious consideration to suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, broker, borrower, or other debtor from doing further business with it or engaging in programs sponsored by it if such a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 must be reported to the Treasury Department at once. Notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Federal Government has been revoked or forfeited by the Treasury Department will be forwarded by that Department to all interested agencies.

      (b) If NASA is holding security or collateral which may be liquidated and the proceeds applied on debts due it through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, it should do so by such procedures if the debtor fails to pay the debt within a reasonable time after demand, unless the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure. NASA will provide the debtor with reasonable notice of the sale, an accounting of any surplus proceeds, and any other procedures required by applicable contract or law. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety or insurance concern unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.

      § 1261.411   Collection in installments.

#### § § 1261.411

      (a) Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest penalties, and administrative costs as required by § 1261.412, should be collected in full in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected by administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. Debtors who represent that they are unable to pay the debt in one lump sum must submit justification, including financial statements. If NASA agrees to accept payment in regular installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor which specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim in not more than three years. Installment payments of less than $50 per month should be accepted only if justifiable on the grounds of financial hardship or similar reasonable cause. If the claim is unsecured, an executed confess-judgment note should be obtained from a debtor when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750. Such notes may be sought when an unsecured obligation of a lesser amount is involved. When attempting to obtain confess-judgment notes, the debtor should be provided with written explanation of the consequences of signing the note, and documentation should be maintained sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor has signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Security for deferred payments other than a confess-judgment note may be accepted in appropriate cases. NASA, at its option, may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of a debtor to execute a confess-judgment note or to give other security.

      (b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment payment is to be applied as among those debts, that designation must be followed. If the debtor does not designate the application of the payment, agencies should apply payments to the various debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

      § 1261.412   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

#### § § 1261.412

      (a) Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, NASA shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States. Before assessing these charges, NASA must mail or hand deliver a written notice to the debtor explaining the requirements concerning the charges (see § 1261.407(b)).

      (b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt and the interest requirements is first mailed or hand delivered to the debtor (on or after October 25, 1982), using the most current address that is available to the agency. If an “advance billing” procedure is used—that is, a bill is mailed before the debt is actually owed—it can include the required interest notification in the advance billing, but interest may not start to accrue before the debt is actually owed. Designated officials should exercise care to ensure that the notices required by this section are dated and mailed or hand delivered on the same day.

      (c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the  and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. NASA may assess a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States. The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except that where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, NASA may set a new interest rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury Department at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest should not be assessed on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. However, if the debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges which accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal to be paid under a new repayment agreement.

      (d) NASA shall assess against a debtor charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt—that is, the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent as defined in § 1261.401(b). Calculations of administrative costs should be based upon actual costs incurred or upon cost analyses establishing an average of actual additional costs incurred by the agency in processing and handling claims against other debtors in similar stages of delinquency. Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are attributable to delinquency.

      (e) NASA shall assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 percent a year, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent as defined in § 1261.401(b) for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.

      (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.

      (g) NASA must waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. NASA may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Also, NASA may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, and/or administrative costs (assessed under this section) under the criteria specified in § 1261.414 relating to the compromise of claims (without regard to the amount of the debt), or if NASA determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interests of the United States. See 4 CFR 101.13(g). Such optional waivers should be handled on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with officials designated under § 1261.403. Examples of situations in which NASA may consider waiving interest and other related charges are:

      (1) Pending consideration of a request for reconsideration or administrative review;

      (2) Acceptance of an installment plan or other compromise agreement, where there is no indication of lack of good faith on the part of the debtor in not repaying the debt, and the debtor has provided substantiating information of inability to pay or other unavoidable hardship which reasonably prevented the debt from being repaid.

      (h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which collection action must be suspended under § 1261.416(c)(3).

      (i)  (1) The provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717 do not apply:

      (i) To debts owed by any State or local government;

      (ii) To debts arising under contracts which were executed prior to, and were in effect on (i.e., were not completed as of) October 25, 1982;

      (iii) To debts where an applicable statute, regulation required by statute, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits such charges or explicitly fixes the charges that apply to the debts involved; or

      (iv) To debts arising under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code, or the tariff laws of the United States.

      (2) NASA may, however, assess interest and related charges on debts which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory authority.

      § 1261.413   Analysis of costs; automation; prevention of overpayments, delinquencies, or defaults.

#### § § 1261.413

      The Office of the NASA Chief Financial Officer will:

      (a) Issue internal procedures to provide for periodic comparison of costs incurred and amounts collected. Data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges should be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, and assist in evaluating offers in compromise.

      (b) Consider the need, feasibility, and cost effectiveness of automated debt collection operation.

      (c) Establish internal controls to identify causes, if any, of overpayments, delinquencies, and defaults, and establish procedures for corrective actions as needs dictate.

      § 1261.414   Compromise of claims.

#### § § 1261.414

      (a) Designated NASA officials (see §§ 1261.402 and 1261.403) may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the Agency where the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000, prior to the referral of such claims to the Government Accountability Office, or to the Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General may exercise such compromise authority with respect to claims referred to the Government Accountability Office prior to their further referral for litigation. Only the Comptroller General may effect the compromise of a claim that arises out of an exception made by the Government Accountability Office in the account of an accountable officer, including a claim against the payee, prior to its referral by the Government Accountability Office for litigation.

      (b) When the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with the Department of Justice. NASA should evaluate the offer, using the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, and may recommend compromise for reasons under one, or more than one, of those paragraphs. If NASA then wishes to accept the compromise, it must refer the matter to the Department of Justice, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. See § 1261.417(e) or 31 CFR 904.2(c). Claims for which the gross amount is over $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. The referral should specify the reasons for the Agency's recommendation. If NASA has a debtor's firm written offer of compromise which is substantial in amount and the Agency is uncertain as to whether the offer should be accepted, it may refer the offer, the supporting data, and particulars concerning the claim to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice. The Government Accountability Office or the Department of Justice may act upon such an offer or return it to the agency with instructions or advice. If NASA wishes to reject the compromise, Government Accountability Office or Department of Justice approval is not required.

      (c) A claim may be compromised pursuant to this section if NASA cannot collect the full amount because of the debtor's inability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time, or the refusal of the debtor to pay the claim in full and the Government's inability to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings. In determining the debtor's inability or refusal to pay, the following factors, among others, may be considered:

      (1) Age and health of the debtor;

      (2) Present and potential income;

      (3) Inheritance prospects;

      (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor;

      (5) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings; and

      (6) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property will bring at forced sale may properly be considered in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. The compromise should be for an amount which bears a reasonable relation to the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, having regard for the exemptions available to the debtor and the time which collection will take.

      (d) A claim may be compromised if there is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases should fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal question involved, the probabilities with respect to full or partial recovery of a judgment, paying due regard to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government claim, and related pragmatic considerations. In determining the litigative risks involved, proportionate weight should be given to the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act which may be assessed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation. See 28 U.S.C. 2412.

      (e) A claim may be compromised if the cost of collecting the claim does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, paying heed to the time which it will take to effect collection. Costs of collecting may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large claims. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, it is legitimate to consider the positive effect that enforced collection of some claims may have on the collection of other claims. Since debtors are more likely to pay when first requested to do so if an agency has a policy of vigorous collection of all claims, the fact that the cost of collection of any one claim may exceed the amount of the claim does not necessarily mean that the claim should be compromised. The practical benefits of vigorous collection of a small claim may include a demonstration to other debtors that resistance to payment is not likely to succeed.

      (f)  Statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance may be compromised pursuant to this part if the agency's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, both present and future, will be adequately served by acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon. Mere accidental or technical violations may be dealt with less severely than willful and substantial violations.

      (g) Compromises payable in installments are to be discouraged. However, if payment of a compromise by installments is necessary, a legally enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon and acceleration of the balance due upon default in the payment of any installment should be obtained, together with security in the manner set forth in § 1261.411, in every case in which this is possible.

      (h) If the agency's files do not contain reasonably up-to-date credit information as a basis for assessing a compromise proposal, such information may be obtained from the individual debtor by obtaining a statement executed under penalty of perjury showing the debtor's assets and liabilities, income, and expenses. Forms such as Department of Justice Form OBD-500 or OBD-500B may be used for this purpose. Similar data may be obtained from corporate debtors using a form such as Department of Justice Form OBD-500C or by resort to balance sheets and such additional data as seems required. Samples of the Department of Justice forms are available from the Office of the NASA General Counsel. Neither a percentage of a debtor's profits nor stock in a debtor corporation will be accepted in compromise of a claim. In negotiating a compromise with a business concern, consideration should be given to requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor.

      (i)  When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld against one such debtor until the other or others pay their proportionate shares. NASA will not attempt to allocate the burden of paying such claims as between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible. Care should be taken that a compromise agreement with one such debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one such debtor shall not be considered a precedent or as morally binding in determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

      § 1261.415   Execution of releases.

#### § § 1261.415

      Upon receipt of full payment of a claim, or the amount in compromise of a claim as determined pursuant to § 1261.414, the official designated in § 1261.402 will prepare and execute, on behalf of the United States, an appropriate release, which shall include the provision that it shall be void if procured by fraud, misrepresentation, the presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.

      § 1261.416   Suspending or terminating collection action.

#### § § 1261.416

      (a) The standards set forth in this section apply to the suspension or termination of collection action pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(3) on claims which do not exceed $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. NASA may suspend or terminate collection action under this part with respect to claims for money or property arising out of activities of the Agency, prior to the referral of such claims to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General (or designee) may exercise such authority with respect to claims referred to the Government Accountability Office prior to their further referral for litigation.

      (b) If, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any, a claim exceeds $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the Department of Justice. If the designated official believes suspension or termination may be appropriate, the matter should be evaluated using the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. If the Agency concludes that suspension or termination is appropriate, it must refer the matter, with its reasons for the recommendation, to the Department of Justice, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. See § 1261.417(e) or 31 CFR 904.2(c). If NASA decides not to suspend or terminate collection action on the claim, Department of Justice approval is not required; or if it determines that its claim is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, it may terminate collection action regardless of the amount involved, without the need for Department of Justice concurrence.

      (c) —(1)  Collection action may be suspended temporarily on a claim when the debtor cannot be located after diligent effort and there is reason to believe that future collection action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the claim, with due consideration for the size and amount which may be realized thereon. The following sources may be of assistance in locating missing debtors: Telephone directories; city directories; postmasters; drivers' license records; automobile title and registration records; state and local government agencies; the Internal Revenue Service (see 4 CFR 102.18); other Federal agencies; employers, relatives, friends; credit agency skip locate reports, and credit bureaus. Suspension as to a particular debtor should not defer the early liquidation cf security for the debt. Every reasonable effort should be made to locate missing debtors sufficiently in advance of the bar of the applicable statute of limitations, such as 28 U.S.C. 2415, to permit the timely filing of suit if such action is warranted. If the missing debtor has signed a confess-judgment note and is in default, referral of the note for the entry of judgment should not be delayed because of the debtor's missing status.

      (2)  Collection action may also be suspended temporarily on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty or personal property and is unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action, and:

      (i) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started running anew; or

      (ii) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the statute of limitations, with due regard to the 10-year limitation prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(1); or

      (iii) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection action will be temporarily suspended, and such temporary suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principle amount of the debt with interest at a later date.

      (3) Request for waiver or administrative review. If the statute under which waiver or administrative review is sought is “mandatory,” that is, if it prohibits the agency from collecting the debt prior to the agency's consideration of the request for waiver or review (see  v.  422 U.S. 682 (1979)), then collection action must be suspended until either: The agency has considered the request for waiver/review; or the applicable time limit for making the waiver/review request, as prescribed in a written notice, has expired and the debtor, upon notice, has not made such a request. If the applicable waiver/review statute is “permissive,” that is, if it does not require all requests for waiver/review to be considered, and if it does not prohibit collection action pending consideration of a waiver/request (for example, 5 U.S.C. 5584), collection action may be suspended pending agency action on a waiver/review request based upon appropriate consideration, on a case-by-case basis, as to whether:

      (i) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted or that the debt (in whole or in part) will be found not owing from the debtor;

      (ii) The Government's interests would be protected, if suspension were granted, by reasonable assurance that the debt could be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; and

      (iii) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship on the debtor.

      (4) If the applicable statutes and regulations would not authorize refund by the agency to the debtor of amounts collected prior to agency consideration of the debtor's waiver/review request (in the event the agency acts favorably on it), collection action should ordinarily be suspended, without regard to the factors specified for permissive waivers, unless it appears clear, based on the request and the surrounding circumstances, that the request is frivolous and was made primarily to delay collection. See 4 CFR 104.2.

      (d)  Collection activity may be terminated and NASA may close its file on the claim based on the following:

      (1) Inability to collect any substantial amount. Collection action may be terminated on a claim when it becomes clear that the Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for the judicial remedies available to the Government, the debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law. In determining the debtor's inability to pay, the following factors, among others, may be considered: Age and health of the debtor; present and potential income; inheritance prospects; the possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; the availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.

      (2)  Collection action may be terminated on a claim when the debtor cannot be located, and either:

      (i) There is no security remaining to be liquidated; or

      (ii) The applicable statute of limitations has run and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of the claim.

      (3)  Collection action may be terminated on a claim when it is likely that the cost of further collection action will exceed the amount recoverable thereby.

      (4)  Collection action should be terminated immediately on a claim whenever it is determined that the claim is legally without merit.

      (5)  Collection action should be terminated when it is determined that the evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to reduce voluntary payment are unavailing.

      (e)  When NASA has doubt as to whether collection action should be suspended or terminated on a claim, it may refer the claim to the Government Accountability Office for advice. When a significant enforcement policy is involved in reducing a statutory penalty or forfeiture to judgment, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, such as the suspension or revocation of a license or the privilege of participating in a Government-sponsored program, NASA may refer such a claim for litigation even though termination of collection activity might otherwise be given consideration under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Claims on which NASA holds a judgment by assignment or otherwise will be referred to the Department of Justice for further action if renewal of the judgment lien or enforced collection proceedings are justified under the criteria discussed in this section.

      § 1261.417   Referral to Department of Justice or Government Accountability Office.

#### § § 1261.417

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, claims on which aggressive collection action has been taken in accordance with § 1261.406 and which cannot be compromised, or on which collection action cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with §§ 1261.414 and 1261.416, shall be promptly referred to the Department of Justice for litigation.

      (1) Claims for which the gross original amount is over $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530.

      (2) Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. Referrals should be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection action and the observance of the regulations contained in this subpart, and in any event, well within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily, referrals should be made within l year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt.

      (3)  NASA is not to refer claims of less than $600, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, for litigation unless:

      (i) Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or

      (ii) The debtor not only has the clear ability to pay the claim but the Government can effectively enforce payment, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.

      (b) Claims arising from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by agencies must be referred to the GAO for review and approval prior to referral to the Department of Justice for litigation, unless NASA has been granted an exception by the GAO. Referrals shall comply with instructions, including monetary limitations, contained in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance to Federal Agencies and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

      (c) When the merits of the claim, the amount owed on the claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, suspension, or termination are in doubt, the designated official should refer the matter to the Government Accountability Office for resolution and instructions prior to proceeding with collection action and/or referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.

      (d) Once a claim has been referred to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice pursuant to this section, NASA shall refrain from having any contact with the debtor about the pending claim and shall direct the debtor to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice, as appropriate, when questions concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. The Government Accountability Office or the Department of Justice, as appropriate, shall be immediately notified by NASA of any payments which are received from the debtor subsequent to referral of a claim under this section.

      (e)  Unless an exception has been granted by the Department of Justice in consultation with the General Accounting Office, the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), which was officially implemented by NASA, effective March 1, 1983, shall be used with all referrals of administratively uncollectible claims. As required by the CCLR, the following information must be included:

      (1)  A checklist or brief summary of the actions previously taken to collect or compromise the claim. If any of the administrative collection actions have been omitted, the reason for their omission must be provided. GAO, the United States Attorney, or the Civil Division of the Department of Justice may return claims at their option when there is insufficient justification for the omission of one or more of the administrative collection actions enumerated in this subpart (see 4 CFR part 102).

      (2)  The current address of the debtor, or the name and address of the agent for a corporation upon whom service may be made. Reasonable and appropriate steps will be taken to locate missing parties in all cases. Referrals to the Department of Justice for the commencement of foreclosure of other proceedings, in which the current address of any party is unknown, will be accompanied by a listing of the prior known addresses of such party and a statement of the steps taken to locate that party.

      (3)  Reasonably current credit data which indicates that there is a reasonable prospect of effecting enforced collection from the debtor, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government. Such credit data may take the form of:

      (i) A commercial credit report;

      (ii) An agency investigative report showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses;

      (iii) The individual debtor's own financial statement executed under penalty of perjury reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; or

      (iv) An audited balance sheet of a corporate debtor.

      (4) Reasons for credit data omissions. The credit data may be omitted if:

      (i) A surety bond is available in an amount sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;

      (ii) The forced sale value of the security available for application to the Government's claim is sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;

      (iii) NASA wishes to liquidate loan collateral through judicial foreclosure but does not desire a deficiency judgment;

      (iv) The debtor is in bankruptcy or receivership;

      (v) The debtor's liability to the Government is fully covered by insurance, in which case NASA will furnish such information as it can develop concerning the identity and address of the insurer and the type and amount of insurance coverage; or

      (vi) The status of the debtor is such that credit data is not normally available or cannot reasonably be obtained, for example, a unit of State or local government.

      (f)  Care will be taken to preserve all files, records, and exhibits on claims referred or to be referred to the Department of Justice for litigation. Under no circumstances should original documents be sent to the Department of Justice or the United States Attorney without specific prior approval to do so. Copies of relevant documents should be sent whenever necessary.

      § 1261.418   Transfer of debts to Treasury for collection.

#### § § 1261.418

      Unless subject to an exception identified in 31 CFR 285.12(d), NASA shall transfer any debt that is more than 180 days delinquent to the Financial Management Service for debt collection services in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12.

    Subpart 1261.5—Administrative Offset of Claims

**Source:** Source: 52 FR 19487, May 26, 1987, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1261.500   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 1261.500

      (a) This subpart applies to collection of claims by administrative offset under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3716), other statutory authority, or the common law; it does not include “Salary Offset,” which is governed by subpart 1261.6, infra.

      (b) NASA shall refer past due, legally enforceable nontax debts which are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary of the Treasury for collection by centralized administrative offset. For purposes of debts governed by this provision, NASA adopts and will follow the procedures established by the Department of the Treasury in 31 CFR 901.3.

      (c) For claims not subject to mandatory transfer to the Department of the Treasury pursuant to paragraph (b), NASA may consider  non-centralized administrative offset of claims at its sole discretion. Any  non-centralized administrative offset of claims will be conducted consistent with the requirements of 31 CFR 901.3(c).

      (1) Debts owed by any State or local Government;

      (2) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States; or

      (3) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. However, unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

> [52 FR 19487, May 26, 1987, as amended at 82 FR 29386, June 29, 2017]

      § 1261.501   Definition.

#### § § 1261.501

      —the term, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means “withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government.”

      § 1261.502   Notification procedures.

#### § § 1261.502

      (a) Before collecting any claims through administrative offset, a 30-day written notice must be sent to the debtor by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice must include:

      (1) The nature and amount of the debt;

      (2) NASA's intention to collect by administrative offset; and

      (3) An explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), or other relied upon statutory authority, which must include a statement that the debtor has the opportunity, within the 30-day notice period, to:

      (i) Inspect and copy records of NASA with respect to the debt;

      (ii) Request a review by NASA of its decision related to the claim; and

      (iii) Enter into a written agreement with the designated official (see § 1261.402) to repay the amount of the claim. However, sound judgment should be exercised in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination should balance the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, NASA should accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.

      (b) NASA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by paragraph (a) of this section if:

      (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and

      (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset must be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.

      (3) In cases where the procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of this section had previously been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority, such as pursuant to a notice of audit disallowance or salary offset under § 1261.603, the agency is not required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative offset.

      § 1261.503   Agency records inspection; hearing or review.

#### § § 1261.503

      (a) NASA shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing when:

      (1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the agency to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or

      (2) Unless otherwise required by law, a hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, although significant matters discussed at the hearing should be documented. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(1). Such hearing may be an informal discussion/interview with the debtor, face-to-face meeting between debtor and cognizant NASA personnel, or written formal submission by the debtor and response by the NASA cognizant personnel with an opportunity for oral presentation. The hearing will be conducted before or in the presence of an official as designated by the NASA General Counsel on a case-by-case basis. The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. However, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, the hearing may be analogous to a fact-finding proceeding with oral presentations; or an informal meeting with or interview of the employee; or formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation, and decision based on the available written record. Ordinarily, hearings may consist of informal conferences before the hearing official in which the employee and Agency officials will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument. The employee may represent himself or herself or be represented by an individual of his or her choice at no cost to the United States. The hearing official must maintain or provide for a summary record of the hearing provided under this subpart. The decision of the reviewing/hearing official should be communicated in writing (no particular form is required) to the affected parties and will constitute the final administrative decision of the Agency.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not require a hearing with respect to debt collection systems, as determinations of indebtedness or waiver from these rarely involve issues of credibility or veracity since NASA has determined that review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(3).

      (c) In those cases where a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing is not required or granted, NASA will nevertheless accord the debtor an opportunity to submit any position regarding the matter by documentation and/or written presentation—that is, the Agency will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the available written record. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(4). In such case, the responsible official or designee shall refer the request to the appropriate NASA Office of General Counsel or Chief Counsel for review and recommendation.

      (d) A request to inspect and/or copy the debtor's own debt records or related files, and/or for a hearing or review accompanied by a statement of the basis or grounds for such hearing or review, must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice under § 1261.502(a). A reasonable time to inspect and copy records will be provided during official working hours, but not to exceed 5 business days, unless a verified statement showing good cause requires a longer period. Any suspension of collection or other charges during the period of the inspection, or hearing or review, shall comply with §§ 1261.412 and 1261.416. Requests for or consideration of compromising the debt must comply with § 1261.414.

      § 1261.504   Interagency requests.

#### § § 1261.504

      (a) Requests to NASA by other Federal agencies for administrative offset should be in writing and forwarded to the Office of the NASA Comptroller, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546.

      (b) Requests by NASA to other Federal agencies holding funds payable to the debtor should be in writing and forwarded, certified return receipt, as specified by that agency in its regulations; however, if such rule is not readily available or identifiable, the request should be submitted to that agency's office of legal counsel with a request that it be processed in accordance with their internal procedures.

      (c) Requests to and from NASA should be processed within 30 calendar days of receipt. If such processing is impractical or not feasible, notice to extend the time period for another 30 calendar days should be forwarded 10 calendar days prior to the expiration of the first 30-day period.

      (d) Requests from or to NASA must be accompanied by a certification that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of (or comparable to) subpart 1261.5 or subpart 1261.6, as applicable, have been fully complied with. NASA will cooperate with other agencies in effecting collection.

      § 1261.505   Multiple debts.

#### § § 1261.505

      When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, NASA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

      § 1261.506   Limitation periods.

#### § § 1261.506

      NASA may not initiate administrative offset to collect a debt under 31 U.S.C. 3716 more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. Determination of when the debt first accrued is to be made in accordance with existing law regarding the accrual of debts, such as under 28 U.S.C. 2415. See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3).

      § 1261.507   Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

#### § § 1261.507

      (a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, NASA may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debts owed to the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in accordance with the OPM regulations (see 5 CFR 831.1801, ).

      (b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, NASA shall include a written certification that:

      (1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;

      (2) NASA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and

      (3) NASA has complied with the requirements of this subpart 1261.5 which implements 4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review.

      (c) Once NASA has decided to request administrative offset under this section, the request should be made as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify and “flag” the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor should be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.

      (d) If NASA collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the designated official should act promptly to modify or terminate the agency's request to OPM for offset.

      (e) OPM is not required or authorized by 4 CFR 102.4 to review the merits of NASA's determination with respect to:

      (1) The amount and validity of the debt;

      (2) Waiver under an applicable statute; or

      (3) Provide or not provide a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing.

      § 1261.508   Offset against a judgment.

      Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.

    Subpart 1261.6—Collection by Offset From Indebted Government Employees

**Source:** Source: 52 FR 19487, May 26, 1987, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1261.600   Purpose of subpart.

#### § § 1261.600

      This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5514 in accordance with the OPM regulation and establishes the procedural requirements for recovering pre-judgment debts from the current pay account of an employee through what is commonly called salary offset, including a situation where NASA (the current paying agency) is not the employee's creditor agency. Salary offset to satisfy a judgment or a court determined debt is governed by section 124 of Pub. L. 97-276 (October 2, 1982), 5 U.S.C. 5514

      § 1261.601   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 1261.601

      (a)  This subpart applies to agencies and employees as defined in § 1261.602.

      (b)  This subpart and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in recovering certain prejudgment debts by administrative offset except where the employee consents to the recovery, from the current pay account of an employee. Because it is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart should be consistent with subpart 1261.5.

      (1)  The procedures contained in this subpart do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 ), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), or the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705, employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108, and debts determined by a court as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514 ).

      (2)  This subpart does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of a salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the Government Accountability Office in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Government Accountability Office. Similarly, in the case of other types of debts, it does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver, if waiver is available under any statutory provision pertaining to the particular debt being collected.

      § 1261.602   Definitions.

#### § § 1261.602

      For purposes of this subpart:

      (a)  means:

      (1) An Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, including U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Postal Rate Commission;

      (2) A military department as defined in section 102 of Title 5, United States Code;

      (3) An agency or court in the judicial branch, including a court as defined in section 610 of Title 28, United States Code, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation;

      (4) An agency of the legislative branch, including the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives; and

      (5) Other independent establishments that are entities of the Federal Government.

      (c)  means an amount owed to the United States from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and forfeitures (except those arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice), and all other similar sources.

      (d)  means that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld. NASA must exclude deductions listed in OPM's garnishment regulations at 5 CFR 581.105 (b) through (f) to determine disposable pay subject to salary offset.

      (e)  means a current employee of an agency, including a current member of the Armed Forces or a Reserve of the Armed Forces (Reserves).

      (f)  means the agency employing the individual and authorizing the payment of his or her current pay.

      (g)  means an administrative offset to collect a debt under 5 U.S.C. 5514 by deduction(s) at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of an employee without his or her consent.

      § 1261.603   Procedures for salary offset.

#### § § 1261.603

      If NASA determines that a Federal employee is indebted to the United States or is notified of such by the head of another agency (or delegee), the amount of indebtedness may be collected in monthly installments, or regularly established pay intervals, by deduction from the affected employee's pay account. The deductions may be made from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, from other authorized pay. The requirements in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section must be met before a deduction is made from the current pay account of an employee.

      (a)  The employee must be sent a minimum of 30 days written notice prior to further offset action, which specifies:

      (1) The origin, nature and amount of the indebtedness, and the official to contact within the agency (ordinarily, the designated financial management official for the particular installation);

      (2) The intention of the agency to initiate collection of the debt through salary offset by deductions from the employee's current disposable pay, stating the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of intended deductions (the amount to be deducted for any period, without the consent of the employee, may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay);

      (3) An explanation of any interest, penalties, or administrative costs included in the amount, and that such assessment must be made unless excused in accordance with 14 CFR 1261.412;

      (4) The right for an opportunity (which does not toll the running of the 30-day period) to inspect and copy NASA records relating to the debt or to request and receive (if reasonable) a copy of such records, provided that such opportunity must be exercised on or before the 15th day following receipt of the notice and can be conducted only during official working hours for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 5 working days;

      (5) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to NASA) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the authorized agency official (see 14 CFR 1261.402) and documented in NASA's files (see 14 CFR 1261.407(d));

      (6) An opportunity for a hearing, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, on the agency's determination concerning the existence and amount of the debt, and the terms of the repayment schedule (in the case of an employee whose repayment schedule is established other than by written agreement);

      (7) The hearing request should be addressed to the Office of the NASA General Counsel or to the Office of Chief Counsel of the NASA installation involved, as appropriate; counsel's name and address will be as stated in the notice.

      (8) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

      (9) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.

      (b)  NASA is not required to comply with paragraph (a) of this section for any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.

      (c)  The notice described in paragraph (a) of this section should include the following provisions, which may be copied and attached to the notice.

      (1) The employee may petition for a hearing, but such petition must be in writing and received by NASA on or before the 15th day following receipt of the notice, and include a statement of the reasons for such hearing. No particular form is required, and a timely, legible letter request (with the stated reasons) will suffice; however, the employee must sign the petition and include with it, with reasonable specificity, all the supporting facts and evidence, including a list of the witnesses, if any.

      (2) The petition should be addressed to the Agency counsel designated in the notice, but the hearing will be conducted by an official not under the supervision or control of the NASA Administrator. The Agency Chief Financial Officer is authorized to appoint an administrative law judge or other Federal executive branch employee or official on a reimbursable or other basis. Notice of the name and address of the hearing official will be sent to the employee within 10 days of receipt of petition.

      (3) The timely filing of the petition will stay the commencement of collection; and the final decision on the hearing will be issued at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings.

      (4) Any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

      (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under Chapter 75 of Title 5, United States Code, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

      (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 of Title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; or

      (iii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of Title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority.

      (5) As for the conduct of any live, telephonic, or video teleconference hearing, for additional guidance see 14 CFR 1261.503.

      (d) Petition after time expiration. No petition for a hearing is to be granted if made after the 15-day period prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the employee can show to the satisfaction of the agency official indicated on the notice that the delay was caused by circumstances beyond his or her control (for example, proven incapacity, illness, or hospitalization), or that the agency did not give notice of the time limit and the employee was otherwise unaware of such limit.

      (e)  Ordinarily, debts are to be collected in one lump-sum payment. However, if the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments. The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay (see 14 CFR 1261.411), but the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made (unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount). Deduction must commence with the next full pay interval (ordinarily, the next biweekly pay period). Such installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active duty or employment, as the case may be, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (f)  An offset may produce an extreme financial hardship for an employee if it prevents the employee from meeting costs necessarily incurred for essential subsistence expenses for food, reasonable housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care. In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting the essential subsistence expenses, the employee may be required to show income from all sources (including spouse and dependents, if applicable), list all known assets, explain exceptional expenses, and produce any other relevant factors.

      (g)  If the employee retires or resigns from Federal service, or if his or her employment or period of active duty ends before collection of the debt is completed, the balance may be deducted from the final salary payment and any remaining balance from the lump-sum leave, if applicable. If the debt is not fully paid by offset from any final payment due the former employee as of the date of separation, offset may be made from later payments of any kind due the former employee from the United States (as provided in 14 CFR part 1261 subpart 1261.5, including offset from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund under 14 CFR 1261.507).

      (h)  Assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, on debts being collected under this subpart, shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 1261.412 which implements 4 CFR 102.13.

      § 1261.604   Nonwaiver of rights by involuntary setoff.

#### § § 1261.604

      The employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of the debt, being collected under this subpart, must not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under an existing written contract applicable to the specific debt or under any other pertinent statutory authority for the collection of claims of the United States or the agency.

      § 1261.605   Refunds.

#### § § 1261.605

      (a) NASA will promptly refund to the employee amounts paid or deducted under this subpart when:

      (1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or

      (2) The employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay.

      (b) Refunds are not to bear any interest unless the law applicable to that particular debt specifically requires or permits a stated interest amount on refunds.

      § 1261.606   Salary offset request by a creditor agency other than NASA (the current paying agency).

#### § § 1261.606

      (a)  Upon completion of the procedures established by the creditor agency under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor agency must:

      (1) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is/are due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM;

      (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the creditor agency must also advise NASA of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required; and

      (3) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the writing or statement is attached to the debt claim request, the creditor agency must also indicate the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2) and give the date(s) the action(s) was/were taken.

      (b)  The creditor agency may not initiate offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, except as provided in 14 CFR 1261.506, which implements 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3).

      (c) —(1)  If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(1) of the OPM regulations (14 CFR 1261.603(f)) for “liquidation from final check.” NASA must then certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If NASA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it should notify the creditor agency and forward the copy of the debt claim and certification to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. However, the creditor agency, not NASA, must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection can be made.

      (2)  If the employee is already separated and all payments due from NASA have been paid, NASA must return the claim to the creditor agency for any further collection, indicating the employee's date of separation and the current employment and mailing address(es), if known.

      (3) Employee who transfers from NASA to another Federal agency.

      (i)  If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to NASA, the employee transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is collected in full, NASA must then certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. A copy of the certification should be furnished the employee, and another copy furnished to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.

      (ii)  Information on the debt claim must be inserted in the employee's official personnel folder along with a copy of the certification of the amount which has been collected. Upon receiving the official personnel folder, the new paying agency must resume the collection from the employee's current pay account and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. It will not be necessary for the creditor agency to repeat the due process procedures described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 of this subpart in order to resume the collection. However, it will be the responsibility of the creditor agency to review the debt upon receiving NASA's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

      (d) —(1)  If NASA receives incomplete debt claim information, it must return the request with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart must be provided and complete debt claim information received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.

      (2)  If NASA receives a properly documented debt claim, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt claim request must be given to the debtor, along with notice of the date deductions will commence if different from that stated on the debt claim request.

      (3) NASA is not required or authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim request.

      § 1261.607   Obtaining the services of a hearing official.

#### § § 1261.607

      (a) When the debtor does not work for the creditor agency and the creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the creditor agency may contact an agent of the paying agency designated in appendix A of 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official, and the paying agency must then cooperate as provided by 4 CFR 102.1 and provide a hearing official.

      (b) When the debtor works for the creditor agency, the creditor agency may contact any agent (of another agency) designated in appendix A of 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. Agencies must then cooperate as required by 4 CFR 102.1 and provide a hearing official.

    Subpart 1262.1—General Provisions

      § 1262.101   Purpose of these rules.

#### § § 1262.101

      (a) The pertinent provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act at 5 U.S.C. 504 (hereinafter “the Act”) provide for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”). An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails, unless it has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, or the Agency's position in the proceeding was substantially justified, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use in determining awards.

      (b) As used in this part:

      (1)  means:

      (i) An adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel or otherwise, but excludes an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate or for the purpose of granting or renewing a license;

      (ii) Any appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 605) before an agency board of contract appeals as provided in section 8 of the CDA (41 U.S.C. 607);

      (iii) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (added by section 6104 of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1948, Oct. 21, 1986), 31 U.S.C. 3801,  as amended); and

      (iv) The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993 (added by section 4(b), of RFRA (Pub. L. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1489, Nov. 16, 1993), 42 U.S.C. 2000bb).

      (2)  means the deciding official, without regard to whether the official is designated an administrative law judge, a hearing officer or examiner, or otherwise, who presided at the adversary adjudication;

      (3)  means, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary adjudication is based;

      (4)  as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), includes a person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party, in an agency proceeding, and a person or agency admitted by an agency as a party for limited purposes, and who meets the eligibility requirements of § 1262.104; and

      (5)  with a capital A denotes the NASA.

      (c) Determination of  Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.

      § 1262.102   When the Act applies.

#### § § 1262.102

      The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced before NASA on or after August 5, 1985. It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in subpart 1262.2, had been filed with the Agency within 30 days after August 5, 1985, and to any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

      § 1262.103   Proceedings covered.

#### § § 1262.103

      (a) The Act applies to the following adversary adjudications conducted by the Agency:

      (1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of NASA or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceedings;

      (2) Appeals of decisions made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Board of Contract Appeals (BCA) as provided in Section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607);

      (3) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (31 U.S.C. 3801,  as amended); and

      (4) Adjudications under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb).

      (b) The Act does not apply to:

      (1) Any proceeding in which this Agency may prescribe a lawful present or future rate;

      (2) Proceedings to grant or renew licenses (note, however, that proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise adversary adjudications); and

      (3) Proceedings which are covered by a compromise or settlement agreement, unless specifically consented to in such agreement.

      (c) NASA may also designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Agency's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filling of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.

      (d) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

> [60 FR 12668, Mar. 8, 1995]

      § 1262.104   Eligibility of applicants.

#### § § 1262.104

      (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses, the applicant must be a “party” to the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart 1262.2.

      (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:

      (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;

      (2) Any owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;

      (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;

      (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and

      (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.

      (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.

      (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than as a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather then to business interests.

      (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.

      (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

      (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

> [51 FR 15311, Apr. 23, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 12668, Mar. 8, 1995]

      § 1262.105   Standards for awards.

#### § § 1262.105

      (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award subject to paragraph (b) of this section, for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. No presumption arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified simply because the agency did not prevail. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency.

      (b) An award, for any portion of the adversary adjudication, will be denied if the applicant has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, or denied or reduced if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.

      § 1262.106   Allowable fees and expenses.

#### § § 1262.106

      (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.

      (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which this Agency pays expert witnesses, which is $20 an hour (5 hours maximum) or maximum daily rate of $100 (3 days maximum). However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.

      (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:

      (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar service, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;

      (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;

      (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the application;

      (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and

      (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.

      (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

      § 1262.107   Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

#### § § 1262.107

      (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Agency may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher then $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. This Agency will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).

      (b) Any person may file with the Agency a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should be addressed to the General Counsel, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Agency should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used; and should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Agency will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding or denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

      § 1262.108   Awards against other agencies.

#### § § 1262.108

      If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding before NASA, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency, subject to § 1262.105(b), if it had taken a position that is not substantially justified.

      § 1262.109   Delegations of authority.

#### § § 1262.109

      (a) The NASA Administrator hereby delegates authority to the General Counsel or designee to take final action on matters pertaining to the Act, other than the authority for final fee determination after Agency review pursuant to § 1262.308.

      (b) The NASA Administrator may, in particularly specified matters under the Act, delegate authority to officials other than those designated in paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart 1262.2—Information Required From Applicants

      § 1262.201   Contents of application.

#### § § 1262.201

      (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of an agency or agencies in the proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.

      (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if the applicant:

      (1) Attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or

      (2) States that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).

      (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expense for which an award is sought.

      (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes this Agency to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.

      (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

      (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 1262.104(f) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.

      (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public records of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The materials in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Agency's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act, at 14 CFR part 1206.

      § 1262.302   Answer to application.

#### § § 1262.302

      (a) Within 30 calendar days after service of an application, counsel representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

      (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 calendar days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.

      (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency counsel's position.

      § 1262.305   Settlement.

#### § § 1262.305

      The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded.

      § 1262.306   Further proceedings.

#### § § 1262.306

      (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or, as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.

      (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

      (1) The applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party;

      (2) Whether the Agency's position was substantially justified;

      (3) Whether the applicant unreasonably protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust; and

      (4) The amounts, if any, awarded for fees and expenses with an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. Further, if the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

      (b) When the Agency appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.

Whether to review a decision is solely a matter within the discretion of the NASA Administrator. A 15-day notice of such review will be given the applicant and agency counsel, and a determination made not later than 45 days from the date of notice.

The court's determination of any appeal heard under this [authority] shall be based solely on the factual record made before the agency. The court may modify the determination of fees and other expenses only if the court finds that the failure to make an award of fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award, was unsupported by the substantial evidence.

#### § § 1263.108

    If the court or other authority which caused the demand to be issued declines to stay the effect of the demand pending a final decision by the General Counsel or designate; or if the General Counsel or designate directs that the employee may not comply with the demand, and a court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of that decision, the employee upon whom the demand has been made, or an agency or other governmental attorney, shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand and shall cite, “United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, et al., 340 U.S. 462 (1951).”

    (b)  A party filing a document with the presiding officer shall, at the time of filing, serve a copy of such document on every other party. Service upon any party of any document other than those required to be served as prescribed in § 1264.107 shall be made by delivering a copy or by placing a copy of the document in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the party's last known address. When a party is represented by a representative, service shall be made upon such representative.

    (c)  A certificate of the individual serving the document by personal delivery or by mail, setting forth the manner of service, shall be proof of service.

    (a) The presiding officer shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under § 1264.102 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.

    § 1264.130   Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

#### § § 1264.130

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the presiding officer, and the authority head upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.

    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the presiding officer and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:

    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;

    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;

    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;

    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;

    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;

    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;

    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;

    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;

    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;

    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;

    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;

    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;

    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and

    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.

    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the presiding officer or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.

    § 1264.131   Location of hearing.

#### § § 1264.131

    (a) The hearing may be held—

    (1) In any judicial district of the United States in which the defendant resides or transacts business;

    (2) In any judicial district of the United States in which the claim or statement in issue was made; or

    (3) In such other place as may be agreed upon by the defendant and the presiding officer.

    (b) Each party shall have the opportunity to present argument with respect to the location of the hearing.

    (c) The hearing shall be held at the place and at the time ordered by the presiding officer.

#### § § 1264.132

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.

    (b) At the discretion of the presiding officer, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 1264.121(a).

    (c) The presiding officer shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, avoid needless consumption of time, and protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

    (d) The presiding officer shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.

    (e) At the discretion of the presiding officer, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the presiding officer, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.

    (f) Upon motion of any party, the presiding officer shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—

    (1) A party who is an individual;

    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated by the party's representative; or

    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.

  PART 1266—CROSS-WAIVER OF LIABILITY

### Part 1266

**Authority:** Authority: 51 U.S.C. 20139 and 51 U.S.C. 20113(a), (e), and (f).

**Source:** Source: 73 FR 10148, Feb. 26, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

    § 1266.100   Purpose.

#### § § 1266.100

    The purpose of this Part is to ensure that consistent cross-waivers of liability are included in NASA agreements for activities related to the ISS and for NASA's science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS that involve a launch.

    § 1266.101   Scope.

#### § § 1266.101

    The provisions at § 1266.102 are intended to implement the cross-waiver requirement in Article 16 of the intergovernmental agreement entitled, “Agreement Among the Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, and the Government of the United States of America concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station (IGA).” Article 16 establishes a cross-waiver of liability for use by the Partner States and their related entities and requires that this reciprocal waiver of claims be extended to contractually or otherwise-related entities of NASA by requiring those entities to make similar waivers of liability. Thus, NASA is required to include IGA-based cross-waivers in agreements for ISS activities that fall within the scope of “Protected Space Operations,” as defined in § 1266.102. The provisions of § 1266.102 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA agreements for activities that implement the IGA and the memoranda of understanding between the United States and its respective international partners. The provisions of § 1266.104 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA launch agreements for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS.

    § 1266.102   Cross-waiver of liability for agreements for activities related to the International Space Station.

#### § § 1266.102

    (a) The objective of this section is to implement NASA's responsibility to flow down the cross-waiver of liability in Article 16 of the IGA to its related entities in the interest of encouraging participation in the exploration, exploitation, and use of outer space through the International Space Station (ISS). The IGA declares the Partner States' intention that the cross-waiver of liability be broadly construed to achieve this objective.

    (b) For the purposes of this section:

    (1) The term “Party” means a party to a NASA agreement involving activities in connection with the ISS.

    (2)(i) The term “related entity” means:

    (A) A contractor or subcontractor of a Party or a Partner State at any tier;

    (B) A user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier; or

    (C) A contractor or subcontractor of a user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier.

    (ii) The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor” include suppliers of any kind.

    (iii) The term “related entity” may also apply to a State, or an agency or institution of a State, having the same relationship to a Partner State as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section or otherwise engaged in the implementation of Protected Space Operations as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

    (3) The term “damage” means:

    (i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, any person;

    (ii) Damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property;

    (iii) Loss of revenue or profits; or

    (iv) Other direct, indirect, or consequential damage.

    (4) The term “launch vehicle” means an object, or any part thereof, intended for launch, launched from Earth, or returning to Earth which carries payloads or persons, or both.

    (5) The term “payload” means all property to be flown or used on or in a launch vehicle or the ISS.

    (6) The term “Protected Space Operations” means all launch or transfer vehicle activities, ISS activities, and payload activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and outer space in implementation of the IGA, MOUs concluded pursuant to the IGA, and implementing arrangements. It includes, but is not limited to:

    (i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, integration, operation, or use of launch or transfer vehicles, the ISS, payloads, or instruments, as well as related support equipment and facilities and services; and

    (ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training, simulation, or guidance and control equipment and related facilities or services. “Protected Space Operations” also includes all activities related to evolution of the ISS, as provided for in Article 14 of the IGA. “Protected Space Operations” excludes activities on Earth which are conducted on return from the ISS to develop further a payload's product or process for use other than for ISS-related activities in implementation of the IGA.

    (7) The term “transfer vehicle” means any vehicle that operates in space and transfers payloads or persons or both between two different space objects, between two different locations on the same space object, or between a space object and the surface of a celestial body. A transfer vehicle also includes a vehicle that departs from and returns to the same location on a space object.

    (8) The term “Partner State” includes each Contracting Party for which the IGA has entered into force, pursuant to Article 25 of the IGA or pursuant to any successor agreement. A Partner State includes its Cooperating Agency. It also includes any entity specified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NASA and the Government of Japan to assist the Government of Japan's Cooperating Agency in the implementation of that MOU.

    (c)(1) Cross-waiver of liability: Each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Party waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:

    (i) Another Party;

    (ii) A Partner State other than the United States of America;

    (c)(1) Cross-waiver of liability: Each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Party waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:

    (i) Another Party;

    (ii) A party to another NASA agreement that includes flight on the same launch vehicle;

    (iii) A related entity of any entity identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section; or

    Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

      § 1271.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 1271.200

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1271.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

      (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

      (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 1271.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1271.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1271.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 1271.210   Reporting.

#### § § 1271.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 1271.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1271.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1271.100(a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 1271.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 1271.400   Penalties.

#### § § 1271.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $24,496 and not more than $244,958 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $24,496 and not more than $244,958 for each such failure.

An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $24,496, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $24,496 and $244,958, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

    § 1275.100   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1275.100

    (a) The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to be used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the handling of allegations of research misconduct. Specifically, the procedures contained in this part are designed to result in:

    (1) Findings as to whether research misconduct by a person or institution has occurred in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting results from research activities funded or supported by NASA; and

    (2) Recommendations on appropriate administrative actions that may be undertaken by NASA in response to research misconduct determined to have occurred.

    (b) This part applies to all research wholly or partially funded or supported by NASA. This includes any research conducted by a NASA installation and any research conducted by a public or private entity receiving NASA funds or using NASA facilities, equipment or personnel, under a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, Space Act agreement, or other transaction with NASA.

    (c) NASA shall make a determination of research misconduct only after careful inquiry and investigation by an awardee institution, another Federal agency, or NASA, and an adjudication conducted by NASA. NASA shall afford the accused individual or institution a chance to comment on the investigation report and a chance to appeal the decision resulting from the adjudication. In structuring procedures in individual cases, NASA may take into account procedures already followed by other entities investigating the same allegation of research misconduct. Investigation of allegations which, if true, would constitute criminal offenses, are not covered by this part.

    (d) A determination that research misconduct has occurred must be accompanied by recommendations on appropriate administrative actions. However, the administrative actions themselves may be imposed only after further procedures described in applicable Federal acquisition and NASA regulations concerning contracts, cooperative agreements, grants, Space Act agreements, or other transactions, depending on the type of agreement used to fund or support the research in question. Administrative actions involving NASA civil service employees may be imposed only in compliance with all relevant Federal laws and policies.

    (e) Allegations of research misconduct concerning NASA research may be transmitted to NASA in one of the following ways: By mail address to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546-0001 via the NASA OIG Hotline at 1-800-424-9183, or cyber hotline at

    (f) To the extent permitted by law, the identity of the Complainant, witnesses, or other sources of information who wish to remain anonymous shall be kept confidential. To the extent permitted by law, NASA shall protect the research misconduct inquiry, investigation, adjudication, and appeal records maintained by NASA as exempt from mandatory disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Privacy Act, as amended.

    § 1275.102   OIG handling of research misconduct matters.

#### § § 1275.102

    (a) When an allegation is made to the OIG, rather than to the awardee institution, the OIG shall determine whether the allegation concerns NASA research and whether the allegation, if true, falls within the definition of research misconduct in § 1275.101(a). Investigation of allegations which, if true, would constitute criminal offenses, are not covered by this part. If these criteria are met and the research in question is being conducted by NASA researchers, the OIG shall proceed in accordance with § 1275.104. If the research in question is being conducted at an awardee institution, another Federal agency, or is a collaboration between NASA researchers and co-investigators at either academia or industry, the OIG must refer the allegation that meets the definition of research misconduct to the entities involved and determine whether to—

    (1) Defer its inquiry or investigation pending review of the results of an inquiry or investigation conducted at the awardee institution or at the Federal agency (referred to for purposes of this part as ) determined to be the lead investigative organization for the case; or

    (2) Commence its own inquiry or investigation.

    (b) The OIG must inform the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist of all allegations that meet the definition of research misconduct received by the OIG and of the determinations of the OIG required by § 1275.101. The NASA Office of the Chief Scientist shall notify the NASA Office of the Chief Engineer or the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist when the research is either engineering or technology research.

    (c) The OIG should defer its inquiry or investigation pending review of the results of an external investigation whenever possible. Nevertheless, the OIG retains the right to proceed at any time with a NASA inquiry or investigation. Circumstances in which the OIG may elect not to defer its inquiry or investigation include, but are not limited to, the following:

    (1) When the OIG determines that the awardee institution is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this part;

    (2) When the OIG determines that NASA involvement is needed to protect the public interest, including public health and safety;

    (3) When the OIG determines that the allegation involves an awardee institution of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the investigation itself;

    (4) When the OIG determines that a NASA program or project could be jeopardized by the occurrence of research misconduct; or

    (5) When the OIG determines that any of the notifications or information required to be given to the OIG by the awardee institution pursuant to § 1275.103(b) requires NASA to cease its deferral to the awardee institution's procedures and to conduct its own inquiry or investigation.

    (d) A copy of the investigation report, evidentiary record, and final determination resulting from an external investigation must be transmitted to the OIG for review. The OIG shall determine whether to recommend to the NASA Adjudication Official, or to the lead investigative organization in cases that involve multiple institutions, acceptance of the investigation report and final determination in whole or in part. The OIG's decision must be made within 45 days of receipt of the investigation report and evidentiary record. This period of time may be extended by the OIG for good cause. The OIG shall make this decision based on the OIG's assessment of the completeness of the investigation report, and the OIG's assessment of whether the investigating entity followed reasonable procedures, including whether the Respondent had an adequate opportunity to comment on the investigation report and whether these comments were given due consideration. If the OIG decides to recommend acceptance of the results of the external investigation, in whole or in part, the OIG shall transmit a copy of the final determination, the investigation report, and the evidentiary record to the NASA Adjudication Official, and to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist. When the OIG decides not to recommend acceptance, the OIG must initiate its own investigation.

    (e) In the case of an investigation conducted by the OIG, the OIG shall transmit copies of the investigation report, including the Respondent's written comments (if any), the evidentiary record and its recommendations, to the institution, to the NASA Adjudication Official and to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist.

    (f) Upon learning of alleged research misconduct, the OIG shall identify potentially implicated awards or proposals and, when appropriate, shall ensure that program, grant, or contracting officers handling them are informed. Neither a suspicion nor allegation of research misconduct, nor a pending inquiry or investigation, shall normally delay review of proposals. Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, reviewers or panelists shall not be informed of allegations or of ongoing inquiries or investigations in order to avoid influencing reviews. In the event that an application receives a fundable rating or ranking by a review panel, funding can be deferred by the program until the completion of the inquiry or investigation.

    (g) If, during the course of an OIG conducted inquiry or investigation, it appears that immediate administrative action, as described in § 1275.106, is necessary to protect public health or safety, Federal resources or interests, or the interests of those involved in the inquiry or investigation, the OIG shall inform the NASA sponsor for the research and the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist.

    § 1275.103   Role of awardee institutions.

#### § § 1275.103

    (a) The awardee institutions have the primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct alleged to have occurred in association with their own institutions, although NASA has ultimate oversight authority for NASA research.

    (b) When an allegation of research misconduct related to NASA research is made directly to the OIG and the OIG defers to the awardee institution's inquiry or investigation, or when an allegation of research misconduct related to NASA research is made directly to the awardee institution which commences an inquiry or investigation, the awardee institution is required to:

    (1) Notify the OIG if an inquiry supports a formal investigation as soon as this is determined.

    (2) Keep the OIG informed during such an investigation.

    (3) Notify the OIG immediately—

    (i) If public health or safety is at risk;

    (ii) If Federal resources, reputation, or other interests need protecting;

    (iii) If research activities should be suspended;

    (iv) If there is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law;

    (v) If Federal action is needed to protect the interests of those involved in the investigation; or

    (vi) If the research community or the public should be informed.

    (4) Provide the OIG with a copy of the investigation report, including the recommendations made to the awardee institution's adjudication official and the Respondent's written comments (if any), along with a copy of the evidentiary record.

    (5) Provide the OIG with the awardee institution's final determination, including any corrective actions taken or planned.

    (c) If an awardee institution wishes the OIG to defer its own inquiry or investigation, the awardee institution shall complete any inquiry and decide whether an investigation is warranted within 60 days. It should similarly complete any investigation, adjudication, or other procedure necessary to produce a final determination, within an additional 180 days. If completion of the process is delayed, but the awardee institution wishes NASA's deferral of its own procedures to continue, NASA may require submission of periodic status reports.

    (d) Each awardee institution must maintain and effectively communicate to its staff, appropriate policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the requirements on when and how to notify NASA.

    § 1275.104   Conduct of Inquiry by the OIG.

#### § § 1275.104

    (a) When an awardee institution or another Federal agency has promptly initiated its own investigation, the OIG may defer its inquiry or investigation until it receives the results of that external investigation. When the OIG does not receive the results within a reasonable time, the OIG shall ordinarily proceed with its own investigation.

    (b) When the OIG decides to initiate a NASA investigation, the OIG must give prompt written notice to the individual or institution to be investigated, unless notice would prejudice the investigation or unless a criminal investigation is underway or under active consideration. If notice is delayed, it must be given as soon as it will no longer prejudice the investigation or contravene requirements of law or Federal law-enforcement policies.

    (c) When alleged misconduct may involve a crime, the OIG shall determine whether any criminal investigation is already pending or projected. If not, the OIG shall determine whether the matter should be referred to the Department of Justice.

    (d) When a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice or another Federal agency is underway or under active consideration, the OIG shall determine what information, if any, may be disclosed to the Respondent or to NASA employees.

    (e) To the extent possible, the identity of sources who wish to remain anonymous shall be kept confidential. To the extent allowed by law, documents and files maintained by the OIG during the course of an inquiry or investigation of misconduct shall be treated as investigative files exempt from mandatory public disclosure upon request under the Freedom of Information Act.

    (f) When the OIG proceeds with its own inquiry, it is responsible for ensuring that the inquiry is completed within 60 days after it is commenced. The OIG may extend this period of time for good cause.

    (g) On the basis of what the OIG learns from an inquiry, and in consultation as appropriate with other NASA offices, the OIG shall decide whether a formal investigation is warranted.

    § 1275.105   Conduct of the OIG investigation of research misconduct.

#### § § 1275.105

    (a) The OIG shall make every reasonable effort to complete a NASA research misconduct investigation and issue a report within 120 days after initiating the investigation. The OIG may extend this period of time for good cause.

    (b) A NASA investigation may include:

    (1) Review of award files, reports, and other documents readily available at NASA or in the public domain;

    (2) Review of procedures or methods and inspection of laboratory materials, specimens, and records at awardee institutions;

    (3) Interviews with parties or witnesses;

    (4) Review of any documents or other evidence provided by or properly obtainable from parties, witnesses, or other sources;

    (5) Cooperation with other Federal agencies; and

    (6) Opportunity for the Respondent to be heard.

    (c) The OIG may invite outside consultants or experts to participate in a NASA investigation.

    (d) During the course of the investigation, the OIG shall provide a draft of the investigation report to the Respondent, who shall be invited to submit comments. The Respondent must submit any comments within 20 days of receipt of the draft investigation report. This period of time may be extended by the OIG for good cause. Any comments submitted by the Respondent shall receive full consideration before the investigation report is made final.

    (e) At the end of the investigation proceedings, an investigation report must be prepared that shall include recommended findings as to whether research misconduct has occurred. A recommended finding of research misconduct requires that:

    (1) There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community for maintaining the integrity of the research record;

    (2) The research misconduct be committed intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard of accepted practices; and

    (3) The allegation be proven by a preponderance of evidence.

    (f) The investigation report must also be transmitted with the recommendations for administrative action, when recommended findings of research misconduct are made. Section 1275.106 lists possible recommended administrative actions and considerations for use in determining appropriate recommendations.

    (g) NASA OIG may elect to proceed with its administrative investigation processes in lieu of a research misconduct investigation under this part when the allegation is against a civil service employee (an intramural researcher).

    § 1275.106   Administrative actions.

#### § § 1275.106

    (a) Listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are possible administrative actions that may be recommended by the investigation report and adopted by the adjudication process. They are not exhaustive, and are in addition to any administrative actions necessary to correct the research record. The administrative actions range from minimal restrictions (Group I Actions) to severe restrictions (Group III Actions), and do not include possible criminal sanctions.

    (1) Group I Actions.

    (i) Send a letter of reprimand to the individual or institution.

    (ii) Require as a condition of an award that for a specified period of time an individual, department, or institution obtain special prior approval of particular activities from NASA.

    (iii) Require for a specified period of time that an institutional official other than those guilty of research misconduct certify the accuracy of reports generated under an award or provide assurance of compliance with particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and conditions.

    (2) Group II Actions.

    (i) Restrict for a specified period of time designated activities or expenditures under an active award.

    (ii) Require for a specified period of time special reviews of all requests for funding from an affected individual, department, or institution to ensure that steps have been taken to prevent repetition of the research misconduct.

    (3) Group III Actions.

    (i) Immediately suspend or terminate an active award.

    (ii) Debar or suspend an individual, department, or institution from participation in NASA programs for a specified period of time.

    (iii) Prohibit participation of an individual as a NASA reviewer, advisor, or consultant for a specified period of time.

    (b) In deciding what actions are appropriate when research misconduct is found, NASA officials should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to:

    (i) The degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or reckless;

    (ii) Whether the misconduct was an isolated event or part of a pattern;

    (iii) Whether the misconduct had a significant impact on the research record, research subjects, or other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare.

    § 1275.107   Adjudication.

#### § § 1275.107

    (a) The NASA Adjudication Official must review and evaluate the investigation report and the evidentiary record required to be transmitted pursuant to § 1275.102(d) and (e). The NASA Adjudication Official may initiate further investigations, which may include affording the Respondent another opportunity for comment, before issuing a decision regarding the case. The NASA Adjudication Official may also return the investigation report to the OIG with a request for further fact-finding or analysis.

    (b) Based on a preponderance of the evidence, the NASA Adjudication Official shall issue a decision setting forth the Agency's findings as to whether research misconduct has occurred and recommending appropriate administrative actions that may be undertaken by NASA in response to research misconduct determined to have occurred. The NASA Adjudication Official shall render a decision within 30 days after receiving the investigation report and evidentiary record, or after completion of any further proceedings. The NASA Adjudication Official may extend this period of time for good cause.

    (c) The decision shall be sent to the Respondent, to the Respondent's institution, and, if appropriate, to the Complainant. If the decision confirms the alleged research misconduct, it must include instructions on how to pursue an appeal to the NASA Appeals Official. The decision shall also be transmitted to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist and the OIG.

    § 1275.108   Appeals.

#### § § 1275.108

    (a) The Respondent may appeal the decision of the NASA Adjudication Official by notifying the NASA Appeals Official in writing of the grounds for appeal within 30 days after Respondent's receipt of the decision. If the decision is not appealed within the 30-day period, the decision becomes the final Agency action insofar as the findings are concerned.

    (b) The NASA Appeals Official shall inform the Respondent of a final determination within 30 days after receiving the appeal. The NASA Appeals Official may extend this period of time for good cause. The final determination may affirm, overturn, or modify the decision of the NASA Adjudication Official and shall constitute the final Agency action insofar as the findings are concerned. The final determination shall also be transmitted to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist and the OIG.

    (c) Once final Agency action has been taken pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the recommendations for administrative action shall be sent to the relevant NASA components for further proceedings in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
