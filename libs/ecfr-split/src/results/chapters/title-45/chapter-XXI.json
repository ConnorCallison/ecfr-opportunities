These functions are to serve the purpose of conserving and enhancing the visual assets which contribute significantly to the character and quality of Washington as the nation's capital and which appropriately reflect the history and features of its development over two centuries. Where existing conditions detract from the overall appearance of official Washington or historic Georgetown—such as conditions caused by temporary, deteriorated, or abandoned buildings of little or no historical or architectural value, by interrupted developments, or by vacant lots not devoted to public use as parks or squares—the Commission will favor suitable corrections to these conditions. When changes or additions are proposed in other circumstances, the Commission may consider whether the public need or value of the project or the private interests to be served thereby justify making any change or addition, and it will consider whether the project can be accomplished in reasonable harmony with the nearby area, with a minimum loss of attractive features of the existing building or site, with due deference to the historical and architectural values affected, and without creating an anomalous disturbing element in the public view of the city.\n"

            "P": [
              "(a) Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by CFA with regard to an initial request to amend a record in accordance with the provisions of § 2106.5 of this part, should submit the request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their request for review should contact the Secretary at the address provided herein. \n",
              "(b) The request for review should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from CFA in which the request to amend was denied and also the reasons why the requester believes that the disputed information should be amended. The request for review should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons as required by § 2106.5 of this part set forth by CFA in its decision denying the amendment. Appeals filed without a complete statement by the requester setting forth the reasons for the review will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate process as meaningful as possible, the requester's disagreement should be understandably set forth. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, CFA reserves the right to dispose of the material concerning the request to amend a record if no request for review in accordance with this section is received by CFA within 180 days of the mailing by CFA of its decision upon an initial request. A request for review received after the 180-day period may, at the discretion of the Secretary, be treated as an initial request to amend a record. \n",
              "(c) The request for review should be addressed to the Secretary. \n",
              "(d) Upon receipt of a request for review, the Secretary will convene a review group composed of the Secretary and the Chairman. This group will review the basis for the requested review and will develop a recommended course of action to the office's Committee on Freedom of Information and Privacy (hereinafter referred to as the Committee). If at any time additional information is required from the requestee, the Secretary is authorized to acquire it or authorize its acquisition from the requester. \n",
              "(e) The Committee is composed of: \n",
              "(1) The Chairman; \n",
              "(2) The Secretary; \n",
              "(3) The Assistant Secretary; \n",
              "(4) The Administrative Assistant. \n",
              "(f) The Committee will review the request for review and the recommended course of action and will recommend a decision on the request for review to the Chairman, who has the final authority regarding appeals. \n",
              "(g) The Chairman will inform the requester in writing of the decision on the request for review within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) from the date of receipt by CFA of the individual's request for review unless the Chairman extends the 30-day period for good cause. The extension of and the reasons therefor will be sent by CFA to the requester within the initial 30-day period. Included in the notice of a decision being reviewed, if the decision does not grant in full the request for review, will be a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, and a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with CFA setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision upon the request for review. The Secretary has the authority to determine the “conciseness” of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will have the information in dispute clearly noted and a copy of the concise statement furnished, as well as a concise statement by CFA setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if CFA chooses to file such a statement. A copy of the individual's statement, and, if it chooses, CFA's statement will be sent to any prior transferree of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). \n\n\n"
