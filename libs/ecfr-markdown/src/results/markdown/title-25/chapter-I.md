#### § § 2.102

        (a) Subject to the exceptions in this part and other applicable law or regulation, you may appeal:

        (1) Any discrete, written decision made by a decision-maker that adversely affects you, including a determination by the decision-maker that she or he lacks either the duty or authority to take the action that you have requested; and

        (2) Inaction by Indian Affairs officials by following the procedures in subpart F of this part.

        (b) You may not appeal in the following circumstances.

        (1) You may not separately appeal the issuance of component documents of the administrative record, including, but not limited to, appraisals or market studies, reports, studies, investigations, notices of impoundment or public sale, recommendations, or National Environmental Policy Act documents. The adequacy of these types of documents cannot be challenged unless and until an appealable decision is made in reliance upon these documents.

        (2) You may not appeal an agency's notification to you that it is pursuing or is considering pursuing action against you in Federal district court, unless separate regulations in this title require you to follow administrative appeal procedures in accordance with this part or other regulations such as those listed in § 2.103 to appeal the notification. Such notifications include, but are not limited to, notices that could lead the agency to pursue actions for money damages against you, such as actions for trespass, ejectment, eviction, nuisance, conversion, or waste to Indian land under the Federal common law or statute.

        (3) You may not appeal final agency actions (though you may be able to seek review in Federal district court).

        (c) Any challenge to preliminary, procedural, or intermediate actions by a reviewing official must be submitted to the reviewing official prior to that official's issuing the decision. The reviewing official will address such challenges in the final decision. Such a challenge is not a separate appeal.

        § 2.103   Are all appeals subject to this part?

#### § § 2.103

        Not all appeals are subject to this part. Decisions by some Indian Affairs officials may be appealed to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, subject to the regulations at 43 CFR part 4. Other regulations govern appeals of administrative decisions regarding certain topics. Table 1 to this section lists some decision topics that are subject to different appeals regulations, in whole or in part, and where to find those regulations.

        § 2.104   How will I know what decisions are appealable under this part?

#### § § 2.104

        (a) When an Indian Affairs official makes a decision that is subject to an appeal under this part, she or he will transmit the decision to interested parties by U.S. Mail or, upon request, by electronic mail. Unless the decision is immediately effective, and except for decisions that are subject to appeal to IBIA, the official will include the following notice of appeal rights at the end of the decision document:

        (b) If a decision-maker issues a decision that does not include notice of appeal rights, the decision-maker will provide written notice of appeal rights and the decision may be appealed as follows:

        (1) If the decision-maker discovers within 30 days of issuing the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights, then the decision-maker will provide written notice of appeal rights to interested parties, and inform them that they may appeal the decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice. If no appeal is filed by the new deadline, the interested parties will have failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by this part and the decision will become effective.

        (2) If the decision-maker does not discover within 30 days of issuing the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights and no administrative appeal is filed within 30 days of the issuance of the decision, then the decision becomes effective 31 days after it was issued.

        (3) If the decision-maker discovers, more than 30 days but less than 365 days, after the date of the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights, then the decision-maker will immediately notify the interested parties that the decision was issued without the requisite notice of appeal rights. If the decision has not actually been implemented, the decision-maker shall stay the implementation of the decision and reissue the decision with the appeal rights notice as provided in this section. If the decision has been implemented, the decision maker shall notify the interested parties of that fact, and notify them that they may file a challenge to the decision in Federal court, or pursue the administrative appeal process set out in this section.

        § 2.105   Who will receive notice of decisions that are appealable under this part?

#### § § 2.105

        Except as provided in other regulations governing specific types of decisions (see § 2.103), the decision-maker will transmit a copy of all appealable decisions to all known interested parties at the addresses the decision-maker has on file for them.

        § 2.106   How does this part comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act?

#### § § 2.106

        The information collected from the public under this part is cleared and covered by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1076-NEW. Please note that a Federal Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Interested parties may view the administrative record at the office of the decision-maker. Interested parties may request copies of all or part of the administrative record. Where reproduction and transmission of the administrative record imposes costs on BIA exceeding $50, BIA may charge the requestor for those costs. BIA shall not incur such costs without the requestor's approval. The decision-maker shall respond to requests for documents in the administrative record within 30 days of receipt of the request, either by providing the requested documents or identifying a date by which the documents shall be provided. The decision-maker shall redact the documents provided to the requestor as required by law ( the Privacy Act). The decision-maker may withhold information in the administrative record, invoking privileges available in civil litigation; such withholding being subject to judicial review. Provision of documents in the administrative record to an interested party under this part is not governed by the Freedom of Information Act.

This section does not apply to Tribal records. See 25 U.S.C. 5329(b).

        (c) The decision-maker may file a response to the statement of reasons.

        § 2.214   What requirements apply to my submission of documents?

        (c)  A copy of each document filed in a proceeding under this part must be served by the filing party on the relevant agency official(s) and all other known interested parties. If an interested party is represented by an attorney, service of any document shall be made upon such attorney. Where an interested party is represented by more than one attorney, service upon one of the attorneys shall be sufficient.

        (d)  Every person who files a document in an appeal shall, at the time of the initial filing in the matter, provide his or her contact information. Such person must promptly inform the decision-maker or reviewing official of any change in address. Any successors in interest of such person shall promptly inform the decision-maker or reviewing official of his or her interest in the matter and provide contact information. Agency officials and other parties to an appeal shall have fulfilled their service requirement by transmitting documents to a party's last known address.

        (e)  Documents must be filed within the deadlines established in this part (or by 43 CFR part 4 for filings submitted to the IBIA), or as established by Department officials in a particular matter. Except as otherwise provided by law, in computing any period of time prescribed for filing and serving a document, the day upon which the decision or document to be appealed from or answered was served, or the day of any other event after which the designated period of time begins to run, is not included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, Federal legal holiday, or other day on which the office to which the document is addressed is not conducting business, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day on which the office to which the document is addressed is conducting business. When the time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, Federal legal holidays, and other nonbusiness days shall be excluded in the computation.

        (f)  (1) The deadline for filing and serving any document may be extended by the agency official before whom the proceeding is pending, except that the deadline for filing a Notice of Appeal may not be extended.

        (2) A request for an extension of time must be filed within the time allowed for the filing or serving of the document.

        (3) A request for extension of time must be filed with the same office as the document that is the subject of the request.

An agency official may decline to consider an illegible hand-written submission. An agency official who declines to consider a hand-written submission shall promptly notify the submitter of the decision not to consider the submission.

        (h) Attachments and exhibits not drafted by or for the submitter do not count toward the page limit.

        (i)  Submitting documents by email to an agency official is only permitted when the receiving official has notified the known interested parties that email submissions are acceptable. Documents may only be served via email on interested parties who have stated, in writing, their willingness to accept service by email. No single email submission may exceed 10 megabytes (MB). Submissions may be divided into separate emails for purposes of complying with this requirement. Filings submitted by email shall be in PDF format. Email submissions that arrive at the agency official's office after 5:00 p.m. shall be deemed to have arrived on the next work day.

        (j)  An agency official may decline to consider a submission that does not comply with the requirements in this section, or take other action she/he deems appropriate. A non-compliant submission is nonetheless a Federal record, and must be preserved as other Federal records.

        § 2.300   When is a decision effective?

#### § § 2.300

        (a) Agency decisions that are subject to further administrative appeal become effective when the appeal period expires without an appeal being filed, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter.

        (b) When an agency decision is effective pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or § 2.714, the administrative appeal will proceed unless an interested party challenges the agency decision in Federal court.

        (c) Agency decisions that are subject to further administrative appeal and for which an appeal is timely filed may be made immediately effective by the reviewing official based on public safety, Indian education safety, protection of trust resources, or other public exigency.

        (1) A decision-maker whose decision has been appealed may ask the reviewing official to make the appealed decision immediately effective or the reviewing official may make the appealed decision immediately effective on his or her own initiative.

        (2) A reviewing official's decision to make an appealed decision immediately effective must explain why public safety, Indian education safety, protection of trust resources, or other public exigency justifies making the decision immediately effective. Any challenge to the decision to put an appealed decision into immediate effect shall be incorporated into the ongoing appeal.

        (3) A decision by a reviewing official (other than the IBIA) to place an appealed decision into immediate effect must be in writing and include the following notice of appeal rights:

#### § § 2.400

        § 2.401   How will the reviewing official determine whether to require an appeal bond?

        The reviewing official may require an appeal bond if the party requesting the appeal bond can demonstrate that the delay caused by the appeal may result in a measurable and substantial financial loss or damage to Indian Trust Assets. The amount of the appeal bond will be commensurate with the estimated financial loss or damage to Indian Trust Assets.

        § 2.402   What form of appeal bond will the reviewing official accept?

#### § § 2.402

        Yes. We strongly encourage parties to work together to reach a consensual resolution of disputes whenever possible. Use of an alternative approach to dispute resolution can save time and money, produce more durable and creative solutions, and foster improved relationships. It may be appropriate and beneficial to consider the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes and techniques at any stage in a dispute. The parties may request information from the decision-maker on the use of an ADR process.

        We will consider a request to use alternative dispute resolution at any time. If you file a Notice of Appeal, you may request the opportunity to use a consensual form of dispute resolution.

        § 2.903   What will Indian Affairs do if I request alternative dispute resolution?

#### § § 2.903

        If all interested parties concur, the reviewing official may stay (discontinue consideration of) the appeal while the parties pursue ADR. Where the parties agree to use ADR, Indian Affairs and other interested parties may seek assistance from the Department of the Interior's Office of Collaborative Action and Dispute Resolution (CADR). CADR can assist in planning and facilitating an effective collaboration or dispute resolution process. Parties are encouraged to consider best practices for engagement, including but not limited to, the use of neutral facilitation and other collaborative problem-solving approaches to promote effective dialogue and conflict resolution.

## Subchapter B

    PART 10—INDIAN COUNTRY DETENTION FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS

### Part 10

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 25 U.S.C. 2, 9, 13, 2417, 2453, and 2802.

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 10.1   Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention programs?

#### § § 10.1

      Policies and standards are required to ensure that all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal entities that receive Federal funding for the operation, maintenance, design and construction or renovation of detention facilities, community residential, or holding facilities are supporting constitutional rights and are complying with the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act of 1990. Self-governance tribes and tribes with limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. The provision for funding tribes for detention programs under the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Public Law 99-570, (25 U.S.C. 2453) requires standards and procedures for such facilities.

> [61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

      § 10.2   Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies and standards for detention and holding facilities in Indian country?

#### § § 10.2

      The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services who reports to the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, BIA, establishes policies, procedures, and standards for the operations, design, planning, maintenance, renovation, and construction of detention programs in the BIA and by tribal contract under Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450.

      § 10.3   Who must follow these policies and standards?

#### § § 10.3

      You must follow these minimum policies, standards, and guides if you are part of the BIA or tribal detention or rehabilitation program receiving Federal funding. Self-governance tribes and tribes with limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. Detention officers, guards, cooks and other staff conducting business in the facilities must meet minimum standards of law enforcement personnel as prescribed in 25 CFR part 12, subpart D, “Qualifications and Training Requirements.” Those tribal programs not receiving Federal funding under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as amended) who wish to be accredited are encouraged to use the policies and standards in that part since they have been modified and approved for Indian country.

      § 10.4   What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?

#### § § 10.4

      The risk for human and civil rights violations due to lack of common standards will subject the operation and/or facility to unnecessary exposure to liability. Lack of employee standards, particularly for training and background checks, will increase the risk of misconduct and vicarious liability of the tribes and the Federal government through tort claims. Funding sources for detention programs may become scarce to nonexistent because of contract noncompliance. The tribes' opportunity to receive funding from potential resource sharing agreements with other law enforcement agencies may be damaged because the facility may have to be closed for cause due to violation of the life safety codes.

      § 10.5   Where can I find the policies and standards for the administration, operation, services, and physical plant/construction of Indian country detention, community residential, and holding facilities?

#### § § 10.5

      The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, maintains a manual of policies and procedures called the  The chapter 69 __BIAM__ titled “Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs,” contains the BIA's policies, procedures, and standards for detention and holding programs in Indian country. The standards for the programs within the  are in handbook format for easy field reference and use. Copies of the chapter 69  and handbooks may be obtained from the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

> [61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

      § 10.6   How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being applied uniformly and facilities are properly accredited?

#### § § 10.6

      The tribes and BIA programs will use a phased approach to meeting all non-mandatory detention standards and will document progress on uniform reporting. The BIA Office of Law Enforcement Services will conduct periodic operational evaluations for oversight.

      § 10.7   Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying with the policies and standards?

#### § § 10.7

      The BIA has a trained Detention Specialist on the staff of the Office of Law Enforcement Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is available to conduct evaluations and provide technical assistance or guidance in all facets of Indian country detention programs.

      § 10.8   What minimum records must be kept and reports made at each detention, community residential, or holding facility in Indian country?

#### § § 10.8

      The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services, BIA, will develop all necessary requirements for maintaining records, reporting data, and archiving information. These requirements will be published in 69 BIAM, “Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs.”

> [61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

      § 10.9   If a person is detained or incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, how would they know what their rights, privileges, safety, protection and expected behavior would be?

#### § § 10.9

      When an individual is incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, he/she will be given, or in some cases notified of the availability of, an Inmate Handbook. This book of guidelines describes in detail the inmate's rights, privileges, protection and safety, cleanliness and sanitation, and general health and nutritional standards. The Inmate Handbook describes the emergency evacuation procedures, medical, counseling, rehabilitation services, visitation procedures, and other appropriate information. The Inmate Handbook is published by the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services and maintained by the detention facility administrator at each facility location.

> [61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

      § 10.10   What happens if I believe my civil rights have been violated while incarcerated in an Indian country detention or holding facility?

#### § § 10.10

      All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported immediately to the Internal Affairs Branch of the Office of Law Enforcement Services. This office will ensure that such allegations are immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice through established procedures. The BIA Internal Affairs Branch may also investigate alleged violations and make recommendations for additional action as necessary. Detailed instructions on the procedure to report violations can be found in the Inmate Handbook.

      § 10.11   How would someone detained or incarcerated, or their representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

#### § § 10.11

      At each detention, community residential, or holding facility located in a tribal jurisdiction where federal funds are used for operations or maintenance programs, the BIA's policies, standards, and procedures will be made available upon request. The Inmate Handbook will be made available to all persons at the time they are incarcerated or detained in a facility. There may be times when this may be delayed due to the physical or mental condition of the person at time of incarceration. In these cases, the Inmate Handbook will be made available when the person is deemed receptive and cognizant by the detention officer in charge. All policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines are available at each facility to the public or by writing to the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

    PART 12—INDIAN COUNTRY LAW ENFORCEMENT

### Part 12

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 25 U.S.C. 2, 9, 13, 2417, 2453, and 2802.

**Source:** Source: 62 FR 15611, Apr. 2, 1997, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Responsibilities

        § 12.1   Who is responsible for the Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement function?

#### § § 12.1

        The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, or in the absence of a Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner, is responsible for Bureau of Indian Affairs-operated and contracted law enforcement programs, and for overall policy development and implementation of the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, Public Law 101-379 (25 U.S.C. 2801 ).

        § 12.2   What is the role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Director of Law Enforcement Services?

#### § § 12.2

        The Director of the Office of Law Enforcement Services for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Director) has been delegated the responsibility for the development of law enforcement and detention policies, standards, and management of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) criminal investigations, drug enforcement, training, internal affairs, inspection and evaluation, emergency response forces, and other national level Indian country law enforcement initiatives. The Director publishes these policies and standards in law enforcement manuals and handbooks. The Director is also directly responsible for developing crime prevention and outreach programs within Indian country law enforcement.

        § 12.3   Who supervises Bureau of Indian Affairs criminal investigators?

#### § § 12.3

        All BIA criminal investigators are supervised by other criminal investigators within the Office of Law Enforcement Services.

        § 12.4   Who supervises the Bureau of Indian Affairs uniformed police, detention, and conservation enforcement functions?

#### § § 12.4

        The agency superintendent is directly responsible for the operation and management of BIA uniformed police operations, detention facilities, and conservation enforcement operations at any agency having these programs. The agency superintendent must also ensure technical support is provided to any agency contracting the law enforcement and/or detention program.

      Subpart B—Policies and Standards

        § 12.11   Do I have to follow these regulations?

#### § § 12.11

        You must follow the minimum standards outlined in the regulations in this part if you are part of a BIA or tribal law enforcement program receiving Federal funding or operating under a BIA law enforcement commission.

        § 12.12   What about self-determination?

#### § § 12.12

        The regulations in this part are not intended to discourage contracting of Indian country law enforcement programs under the Indian Self-determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450). The Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs will ensure minimum standards are maintained in high risk activities where the Federal government retains liability and the responsibility for settling tort claims arising from contracted law enforcement programs. It is not fair to law abiding citizens of Indian country to have anything less than a professional law enforcement program in their community. Indian country law enforcement programs that receive Federal funding and/or commissioning will be subject to a periodic inspection or evaluation to provide technical assistance, to ensure compliance with minimum Federal standards, and to identify necessary changes or improvements to BIA policies.

        § 12.13   What happens if I do not follow the rules in this part?

#### § § 12.13

        Your BIA law enforcement commission may be revoked, your law enforcement contract may be canceled, and you may no longer be eligible for tribal shares allocated from the law enforcement budget.

        § 12.14   Where can I find specific policies and standards for law enforcement functions in Indian country?

#### § § 12.14

        BIA will ensure that all Indian country law enforcement programs are provided a copy of the most current policy manuals and handbooks. Every Indian country law enforcement program covered by the regulations in this part must maintain an effective and efficient law enforcement program meeting minimal qualitative standards and procedures specified in chapter 68 Bureau of Indian Affairs Manual (BIAM) and the Law Enforcement Handbook.

      Subpart C—Authority and Jurisdiction

        § 12.21   What authority is given to Indian country law enforcement officers to perform their duties?

#### § § 12.21

        BIA law enforcement officers are commissioned under the authority established in 25 U.S.C. 2803. BIA may issue law enforcement commissions to other Federal, State, local and tribal full-time certified law enforcement officers to obtain active assistance in enforcing applicable Federal criminal statutes, including Federal hunting and fishing regulations, in Indian country.

        (a) BIA will issue commissions to other Federal, State, local and tribal full-time certified law enforcement officers only after the head of the local government or Federal agency completes an agreement with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs asking that BIA issue delegated commissions. The agreement must include language that allows the BIA to evaluate the effectiveness of these special law enforcement commissions and to investigate any allegations of misuse of authority.

        (b) Tribal law enforcement officers operating under a BIA contract or compact are not automatically commissioned as Federal officers; however, they may be commissioned on a case-by-case basis.

        § 12.22   Can Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers enforce tribal laws?

#### § § 12.22

        BIA officers will enforce tribal laws only with the permission of the tribe. Local programs are encouraged to make arrangements and agreements with local jurisdictions to facilitate law enforcement objectives.

        § 12.23   What are the jurisdictional limits in Indian country?

#### § § 12.23

        The Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice must maintain and periodically review and update a memorandum of understanding describing the relationship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the investigation and prosecution of major crimes in Indian country. Any law enforcement programs performing duties under the authority of 25 U.S.C. 2803 must follow the guidelines in the memorandum of understanding and any local United States Attorney's guidelines for the investigation and prosecution of Federal crimes.

      Subpart D—Qualifications and Training Requirements

        § 12.31   Are there any minimum employment standards for Indian country law enforcement personnel?

#### § § 12.31

        The Director must develop, maintain, and periodically review the qualification standards, including medical qualification standards, for all BIA law enforcement, detention, and conservation enforcement occupational series. The standards will be no less stringent than the minimum standards established by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for these occupational series, and may exceed the OPM standards. BIA standards are available for review at any BIA personnel office. All tribal programs are encouraged to develop standards at least as stringent as those established for BIA officers.

        § 12.32   Do minimum employment standards include a background investigation?

#### § § 12.32

        Law enforcement authority is only entrusted to personnel possessing adequate education and/or experience, training, aptitude, and high moral character. All Indian country law enforcement programs receiving Federal funding and/or authority must ensure that all law enforcement officers successfully complete a thorough background investigation no less stringent than required of a Federal officer performing the same duties.

All background investigations must be documented and available for inspection by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

        § 12.33   Are Indian country law enforcement officers paid less than other law enforcement officers?

#### § § 12.33

        An officer's pay is determined by his/her grade and classification. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs must ensure that all BIA law enforcement officer positions are established at no lower grade level on the Federal scale than similar Federal law enforcement officer positions in other agencies. No BIA position performing commissioned law enforcement duties will be classified in other than the GS 0083, police officer series, for uniformed officers and the GS 1811, criminal investigating series, for criminal investigators.

        § 12.34   Do minimum salaries and position classifications apply to a tribe that has contracted or compacted law enforcement under self-determination?

#### § § 12.34

        Any contract or compact with the BIA to provide law enforcement services for an Indian tribe must require a law enforcement officer to be paid at least the same salary as a BIA officer performing the same duties.

        § 12.35   Do Indian country law enforcement officers complete any special training?

#### § § 12.35

        Law enforcement personnel of any program funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs must not perform law enforcement duties until they have successfully completed a basic law enforcement training course prescribed by the Director. The Director will also prescribe mandatory supplemental and in-service training courses.

        § 12.36   Does other law enforcement training count?

#### § § 12.36

        All requests for evaluation of equivalent training must be submitted to the Indian Police Academy for review, with final determination made by the Director. Requests for a waiver of training requirements to use personnel before completing the required courses of instruction must be submitted to the Director and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In no case will such a waiver allow personnel to be used in any position for more than one year without achieving training standards. Failure to complete basic training requirements will result in removal from a law enforcement position.

      Subpart E—Records and Information

        § 12.41   Who keeps statistics for Indian country law enforcement activities?

#### § § 12.41

        The Director maintains a criminal justice information system for Indian country. The Director will prescribe the types of data to be collected and the reporting format to be used to collect information and assemble reports on crime reported in Indian country. These reports may be provided to the Department of Justice. Any law enforcement program receiving funding from the BIA must use the same reporting format and submit the same statistical reports to the Office of Law Enforcement Services as prescribed by the Director and as are required of all BIA law enforcement programs.

        § 12.42   Do Indian country law enforcement programs share information with their own communities or other agencies?

#### § § 12.42

        At intervals established by the Director, each BIA criminal investigations program, and any investigations program receiving BIA funds will consult with local tribal leaders and managers of local patrol and detention programs. They will discuss the quality of the local investigations program and offer feedback and technical assistance. There will be no requirement to disclose confidential investigative information or to compromise ongoing investigations during this process.

      Subpart F—Conduct

        § 12.51   Must Indian country law enforcement officers follow a code of conduct?

#### § § 12.51

        All law enforcement programs receiving Bureau of Indian Affairs funding or commissioning must establish a law enforcement code of conduct which establishes specific guidelines for conduct on and off duty, impartiality, and professional conduct in the performance of duty, and acceptance of gifts or favors. Each officer must acknowledge in writing receiving and understanding of this code of conduct. The acknowledgment will remain on file with the law enforcement program manager as long as the officer is employed there. Training will be conducted on this code of conduct and other ethics issues at least once each year.

        § 12.52   How do I report misconduct?

#### § § 12.52

        The Director will develop and maintain a reporting system that allows any resident of or visitor to Indian country to report officer misconduct. Each law enforcement program in Indian country will maintain instructions on how to register a complaint. An overview of these steps must be posted for public viewing at each law enforcement facility in Indian country.

        § 12.53   Who investigates officer misconduct?

#### § § 12.53

        The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services maintains an internal affairs program that investigates all allegations of misconduct by BIA officers, and any officer receiving funding and/or authority from the BIA. All allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action taken when warranted. Any person having knowledge of officer misconduct must report that information to the officer's supervisor. The supervisor must immediately report allegations to the internal affairs unit. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, the matter may be dealt with locally or it will be investigated by the internal affairs unit. Failure of any BIA employee to report known allegations may be considered misconduct in itself. Citizens may report officer misconduct directly to the internal affairs unit if that is more practical.

        § 12.54   What can I do if I believe my civil rights have been violated?

#### § § 12.54

        All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported immediately to the internal affairs unit. That office will ensure that allegations are immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U. S. Department of Justice through established procedures. BIA's internal affairs unit may also investigate the matter and make recommendations for additional action as necessary.

        § 12.55   Are there any limits on how much force an officer can use when performing law enforcement duties?

#### § § 12.55

        The Director will develop and maintain the use of force policy for all BIA law enforcement personnel, and for programs receiving BIA funding or authority. Training in the use of force, to include non-lethal measures, will be provided annually. All officers will successfully complete a course of instruction in firearms, to include judgement pistol shooting, approved by the Indian Police Academy before carrying a firearm on or off duty.

      Subpart G—Support Functions

        § 12.61   Can I be paid for information that helps solve a crime?

#### § § 12.61

        The Director can spend money to purchase evidence or information, or to offer a reward, in the investigation of a crime. This is subject to the availability of funds. This authority may be delegated in writing to supervisory criminal investigators within the Office of Law Enforcement Services in the BIA. The Director must develop policies and procedures for the expenditure, control, and audit of these funds before their use.

        § 12.62   Who decides what uniform an Indian country law enforcement officer can wear and who pays for it?

#### § § 12.62

        Each local law enforcement program must establish its own uniform requirements for patrol and detention personnel. Uniformed BIA police officers may be paid an annual uniform allowance not to exceed $400. Local programs may provide uniforms and related equipment to officers in lieu of this payment. All law enforcement officers must also have their official identification on their person at all times when performing law enforcement duties. Uniforms, when worn, will be plainly distinguishable from the uniforms of any non-law enforcement personnel working on the reservation.

        § 12.63   Do Indian country law enforcement officers perform other duties as well?

#### § § 12.63

        Law enforcement commissions will only be issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to persons occupying positions as full-time officers. Bureau of Indian Affairs funded or commissioned criminal investigators will not be responsible for supervising or managing any patrol, detention, or other uniformed police programs.

    PART 13—TRIBAL REASSUMPTION OF JURISDICTION OVER CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS

### Part 13

**Authority:** Authority: 25 U.S.C. 1952.

**Source:** Source: 44 FR 45095, July 31, 1979, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Purpose

        § 13.1   Purpose.

#### § § 13.1

        (a) The regulations of this part establish the procedures by which an Indian tribe that occupies a reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10) over which a state asserts any jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588) Pub. L. 83-280, or pursuant to any other federal law (including any special federal law applicable only to a tribe or tribes in Oklahoma), may reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings as authorized by the Indian Child Welfare Act, Pub. L. 95-608, 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. 1918.

        (b) On some reservations there are disputes concerning whether certain federal statutes have subjected Indian child custody proceedings to state jurisdiction or whether any such jurisdiction conferred on a state is exclusive of tribal jurisdiction. Tribes located on those reservations may wish to exercise exclusive jurisdiction or other jurisdiction currently exercised by the state without the necessity of engaging in protracted litigation. The procedures in this part also permit such tribes to secure unquestioned exclusive, concurrent or partial jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters without relinquishing their claim that no Federal statute had ever deprived them of that jurisdiction.

        (c) Some tribes may wish to join together in a consortium to establish a single entity that will exercise jurisdiction over all their members located on the reservations of tribes participating in the consortium. These regulations also provide a procedure by which tribes may reassume jurisdiction through such a consortium.

        (d) These regulations also provide for limited reassumptions including jurisdiction restricted to cases transferred from state courts under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b) and jurisdiction over limited geographical areas.

        (e) Unless the petition for reassumption specifically states otherwise, where a tribe reassumes jurisdiction over the reservation it occupies, any land or community occupied by that tribe which subsequently acquires the status of reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10) also becomes subject to tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.

        § 13.2   Information collection.

#### § § 13.2

        The information collection requirement contained in § 13.11 has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  and assigned clearance number 1076-0112. The information is being collected when federally recognized tribes request reassumption of jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. The information will be used to determine if reassumption of jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings is feasible. Response is required to obtain a benefit.

A tribe that shares territory with another tribe or tribes may reassume jurisdiction only over its own members without obtaining the consent of the other tribe or tribes. Where a group of tribes form a consortium to reassume jurisdiction, the governing body of each participating tribe must submit a resolution.

        (3) The proposed date on which jurisdiction would be reassumed.

        (4) Estimated total number of members in the petitioning tribe or tribes, together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.

Funds that will become available only when the tribe reassumes jurisdiction may be included.

        (9) Copy of any tribal ordinances or tribal court rules establishing procedures or rules for the exercise of jurisdiction over child custody matters.

        (10) Description of child and family support services that will be available to the tribe or tribes when jurisdiction reassumed. Such services include any resource to maintain family stability or provide support for an Indian child in the absence of a family—regardless of whether or not they are the type of services traditionally employed by social services agencies. The description shall include not only those resources of the tribe itself, but also any state or federal resources that will continue to be available after reassumption of jurisdiction.

        (11) Estimate of the number of child custody cases expected during a year together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.

        (12) Copy of any tribal agreements with states, other tribes or non-Indian local governments relating to child custody matters.

        (1) Citation of the statute or statutes upon which the state has based its assertion of jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.

        (2) Clear and definite description of the territory over which jurisdiction will be reassumed together with a statement of the size of the territory in square miles.

In the alternative, the Bureau, if requested by the concerned tribe, shall assist the tribe to enter into agreements with a state or states regarding the care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings, including agreements which may provide for the orderly transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe on a case-by-case basis or agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between the state and the Indian tribe.

#### § § 13.13

        (a) Upon the request of a tribe desiring to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters, Bureau agency and Area Offices shall provide technical assistance and make available any pertinent documents, records, maps or reports in the Bureau's possession to enable the tribe to meet the requirements for Secretarial approval of the petition.

        (b) Upon the request of such a tribe, to the extent funds are available, the Bureau may provide funding under the procedures established under 25 CFR 23.22 to assist the tribe in developing the tribal court and child care services that will be needed when jurisdiction is reassumed.

Such advice and representation shall be undertaken to the extent that the Field Solicitor in his discretion shall consider necessary to discharge said duties, with due regard to the complexity of the legal action contemplated, the availability of staff attorneys for such purposes, the value and extent of the restricted interests involved, possible conflicts between Indians claiming to be owners of such interests, the preference of such owners concerning legal representation, the financial resources available to such owners, the extent to which such owners require similar legal services in connection with their unrestricted properties, and any other factor appropriate for consideration.

#### § § 16.7

      All authority to perform functions relating to Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes which by express provisions of Federal statute had been conferred upon probate or county courts of Oklahoma before such county courts were abolished on January 12, 1969, has since that date been vested in the successor district courts of that State, and all rights of litigants continue undiminished in the successor forum, including the right to appeal from adverse decisions rendered therein to the successor appellate court.

      § 16.8   Summary distribution of small liquid estates.

#### § § 16.8

      Where information, furnished by the Bureau pursuant to § 16.4 or otherwise obtained, reveals that the estate of a deceased Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes contains no restricted land but consists of a restricted interest in funds not exceeding $500 on deposit to the credit of the decedent, the Field Solicitor shall, in the absence of any final decree determining the heirs or legatees of the decedent, prepare and furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of distribution, based on affidavit or other proof of death and heirship or bequest, setting forth the facts of death and heirship or bequest and the amount payable from the estate to each person determined to be an heir or legatee of the decedent. The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or legatee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the order.

The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or devisee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the order. After final action on any order has been taken by the Field Solicitor, the Bureau shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed in the land records of each county within which are located any escheated lands described therein and shall cause the tribe to be credited with any funds in said estate which arose from rents or profits from such lands, unless a timely appeal therefrom has been filed in accordance with part 2 of this title.

In this event, the Regional Director or his/her designated official shall provide a hearing for the grantee within 10 days of the cancellation.

        (d) The hearing referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be conducted as follows:

        (1) The grantee affected shall be notified, in writing, at least 10 days before the hearing. The notice should give the date, time, place, and purpose of the hearing.

        (2) A written record of the hearing shall be made. The record shall include written statements submitted at the hearing or within five days following the hearing.

      Subpart I—Indian Child Welfare Act Proceedings

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 38867, June 14, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

        General Provisions

          § 23.101   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 23.101

          The regulations in this subpart clarify the minimum Federal standards governing implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) to ensure that ICWA is applied in all States consistent with the Act's express language, Congress's intent in enacting the statute, and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.

          § 23.102   What terms do I need to know?

#### § § 23.102

          The following terms and their definitions apply to this subpart. All other terms have the meanings assigned in § 23.2.

          means a nonprofit, for-profit, or governmental organization and its employees, agents, or officials that performs, or provides services to biological parents, foster parents, or adoptive parents to assist in the administrative and social work necessary for foster, preadoptive, or adoptive placements.

          means any group, association, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity owned or controlled by Indians or a Tribe, or a majority of whose members are Indians.

          § 23.103   When does ICWA apply?

#### § § 23.103

          (a) ICWA includes requirements that apply whenever an Indian child is the subject of:

          (1) A child-custody proceeding, including:

          (i) An involuntary proceeding;

          (ii) A voluntary proceeding that could prohibit the parent or Indian custodian from regaining custody of the child upon demand; and

          (iii) A proceeding involving status offenses if any part of the proceeding results in the need for out-of-home placement of the child, including a foster-care, preadoptive, or adoptive placement, or termination of parental rights.

          (2) An emergency proceeding.

          (b) ICWA does not apply to:

          (1) A Tribal court proceeding;

          (2) A proceeding regarding a criminal act that is not a status offense;

          (3) An award of custody of the Indian child to one of the parents including, but not limited to, an award in a divorce proceeding; or

          (4) A voluntary placement that either parent, both parents, or the Indian custodian has, of his or her or their free will, without a threat of removal by a State agency, chosen for the Indian child and that does not operate to prohibit the child's parent or Indian custodian from regaining custody of the child upon demand.

          (c) If a proceeding listed in paragraph (a) of this section concerns a child who meets the statutory definition of “Indian child,” then ICWA will apply to that proceeding. In determining whether ICWA applies to a proceeding, the State court may not consider factors such as the participation of the parents or the Indian child in Tribal cultural, social, religious, or political activities, the relationship between the Indian child and his or her parents, whether the parent ever had custody of the child, or the Indian child's blood quantum.

          (d) If ICWA applies at the commencement of a proceeding, it will not cease to apply simply because the child reaches age 18 during the pendency of the proceeding.

          § 23.104   What provisions of this subpart apply to each type of child-custody proceeding?

#### § § 23.104

          The following table lists what sections of this subpart apply to each type of child-custody proceeding identified in § 23.103(a):

          § 23.105   How do I contact a Tribe under the regulations in this subpart?

#### § § 23.105

          To contact a Tribe to provide notice or obtain information or verification under the regulations in this subpart, you should direct the notice or inquiry as follows:

          (a) Many Tribes designate an agent for receipt of ICWA notices. The BIA publishes a list of Tribes' designated Tribal agents for service of ICWA notice in the  each year and makes the list available on its Web site at

          (b) For a Tribe without a designated Tribal agent for service of ICWA notice, contact the Tribe to be directed to the appropriate office or individual.

          (c) If you do not have accurate contact information for a Tribe, or the Tribe contacted fails to respond to written inquiries, you should seek assistance in contacting the Indian Tribe from the BIA local or regional office or the BIA's Central Office in Washington, DC (see ).

          § 23.106   How does this subpart interact with State and Federal laws?

#### § § 23.106

          (a) The regulations in this subpart provide minimum Federal standards to ensure compliance with ICWA.

          (b) Under section 1921 of ICWA, where applicable State or other Federal law provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of the parent or Indian custodian than the protection accorded under the Act, ICWA requires the State or Federal court to apply the higher State or Federal standard.

        Pretrial Requirements

          § 23.107   How should a State court determine if there is reason to know the child is an Indian child?

#### § § 23.107

          (a) State courts must ask each participant in an emergency or voluntary or involuntary child-custody proceeding whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child. The inquiry is made at the commencement of the proceeding and all responses should be on the record. State courts must instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to know the child is an Indian child.

          (b) If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, but the court does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is or is not an “Indian child,” the court must:

          (1) Confirm, by way of a report, declaration, or testimony included in the record that the agency or other party used due diligence to identify and work with all of the Tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member (or eligible for membership), to verify whether the child is in fact a member (or a biological parent is a member and the child is eligible for membership); and

          (2) Treat the child as an Indian child, unless and until it is determined on the record that the child does not meet the definition of an “Indian child” in this part.

          (c) A court, upon conducting the inquiry required in paragraph (a) of this section, has reason to know that a child involved in an emergency or child-custody proceeding is an Indian child if:

          (1) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child;

          (2) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an Indian child;

          (3) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to know he or she is an Indian child;

          (4) The court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the child's parent, or the child's Indian custodian is on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village;

          (5) The court is informed that the child is or has been a ward of a Tribal court; or

          (6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe.

          (d) In seeking verification of the child's status in a voluntary proceeding where a consenting parent evidences, by written request or statement in the record, a desire for anonymity, the court must keep relevant documents pertaining to the inquiry required under this section confidential and under seal. A request for anonymity does not relieve the court, agency, or other party from any duty of compliance with ICWA, including the obligation to verify whether the child is an “Indian child.” A Tribe receiving information related to this inquiry must keep documents and information confidential.

          § 23.108   Who makes the determination as to whether a child is a member, whether a child is eligible for membership, or whether a biological parent is a member of a Tribe?

#### § § 23.108

          (a) The Indian Tribe of which it is believed the child is a member (or eligible for membership and of which the biological parent is a member) determines whether the child is a member of the Tribe, or whether the child is eligible for membership in the Tribe and a biological parent of the child is a member of the Tribe, except as otherwise provided by Federal or Tribal law.

          (b) The determination by a Tribe of whether a child is a member, whether a child is eligible for membership, or whether a biological parent is a member, is solely within the jurisdiction and authority of the Tribe, except as otherwise provided by Federal or Tribal law. The State court may not substitute its own determination regarding a child's membership in a Tribe, a child's eligibility for membership in a Tribe, or a parent's membership in a Tribe.

          (c) The State court may rely on facts or documentation indicating a Tribal determination of membership or eligibility for membership in making a judicial determination as to whether the child is an “Indian child.” An example of documentation indicating membership is a document issued by the Tribe, such as Tribal enrollment documentation.

          § 23.109   How should a State court determine an Indian child's Tribe when the child may be a member or eligible for membership in more than one Tribe?

#### § § 23.109

          (a) If the Indian child is a member or eligible for membership in only one Tribe, that Tribe must be designated as the Indian child's Tribe.

          (b) If the Indian child meets the definition of “Indian child” through more than one Tribe, deference should be given to the Tribe in which the Indian child is already a member, unless otherwise agreed to by the Tribes.

          (c) If an Indian child meets the definition of “Indian child” through more than one Tribe because the child is a member in more than one Tribe or the child is not a member of but is eligible for membership in more than one Tribe, the court must provide the opportunity in any involuntary child-custody proceeding for the Tribes to determine which should be designated as the Indian child's Tribe.

          (1) If the Tribes are able to reach an agreement, the agreed-upon Tribe should be designated as the Indian child's Tribe.

          (2) If the Tribes are unable to reach an agreement, the State court designates, for the purposes of ICWA, the Indian Tribe with which the Indian child has the more significant contacts as the Indian child's Tribe, taking into consideration:

          (i) Preference of the parents for membership of the child;

          (ii) Length of past domicile or residence on or near the reservation of each Tribe;

          (iii) Tribal membership of the child's custodial parent or Indian custodian; and

          (iv) Interest asserted by each Tribe in the child-custody proceeding;

          (v) Whether there has been a previous adjudication with respect to the child by a court of one of the Tribes; and

          (vi) Self-identification by the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to meaningfully self-identify.

          (3) A determination of the Indian child's Tribe for purposes of ICWA and the regulations in this subpart do not constitute a determination for any other purpose.

          § 23.110   When must a State court dismiss an action?

#### § § 23.110

          Subject to 25 U.S.C. 1919 (Agreements between States and Indian Tribes) and § 23.113 (emergency proceedings), the following limitations on a State court's jurisdiction apply:

          (a) The court in any voluntary or involuntary child-custody proceeding involving an Indian child must determine the residence and domicile of the Indian child. If either the residence or domicile is on a reservation where the Tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction over child-custody proceedings, the State court must expeditiously notify the Tribal court of the pending dismissal based on the Tribe's exclusive jurisdiction, dismiss the State-court child-custody proceeding, and ensure that the Tribal court is sent all information regarding the Indian child-custody proceeding, including, but not limited to, the pleadings and any court record.

          (b) If the child is a ward of a Tribal court, the State court must expeditiously notify the Tribal court of the pending dismissal, dismiss the State-court child-custody proceeding, and ensure that the Tribal court is sent all information regarding the Indian child-custody proceeding, including, but not limited to, the pleadings and any court record.

          § 23.111   What are the notice requirements for a child-custody proceeding involving an Indian child?

#### § § 23.111

          (a) When a court knows or has reason to know that the subject of an involuntary foster-care-placement or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding is an Indian child, the court must ensure that:

          (1) The party seeking placement promptly sends notice of each such child-custody proceeding (including, but not limited to, any foster-care placement or any termination of parental or custodial rights) in accordance with this section; and

          (2) An original or a copy of each notice sent under this section is filed with the court together with any return receipts or other proof of service.

          (b) Notice must be sent to:

          (1) Each Tribe where the child may be a member (or eligible for membership if a biological parent is a member) ( § 23.105 for information on how to contact a Tribe);

          (2) The child's parents; and

          (3) If applicable, the child's Indian custodian.

          (c) Notice must be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested. Notice may also be sent via personal service or electronically, but such alternative methods do not replace the requirement for notice to be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested.

          (d) Notice must be in clear and understandable language and include the following:

          (1) The child's name, birthdate, and birthplace;

          (2) All names known (including maiden, married, and former names or aliases) of the parents, the parents' birthdates and birthplaces, and Tribal enrollment numbers if known;

          (3) If known, the names, birthdates, birthplaces, and Tribal enrollment information of other direct lineal ancestors of the child, such as grandparents;

          (4) The name of each Indian Tribe in which the child is a member (or may be eligible for membership if a biological parent is a member);

          (5) A copy of the petition, complaint, or other document by which the child-custody proceeding was initiated and, if a hearing has been scheduled, information on the date, time, and location of the hearing;

          (6) Statements setting out:

          (i) The name of the petitioner and the name and address of petitioner's attorney;

          (ii) The right of any parent or Indian custodian of the child, if not already a party to the child-custody proceeding, to intervene in the proceedings.

          (iii) The Indian Tribe's right to intervene at any time in a State-court proceeding for the foster-care placement of or termination of parental rights to an Indian child.

          (iv) That, if the child's parent or Indian custodian is unable to afford counsel based on a determination of indigency by the court, the parent or Indian custodian has the right to court-appointed counsel.

          (v) The right to be granted, upon request, up to 20 additional days to prepare for the child-custody proceedings.

          (vi) The right of the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's Tribe to petition the court for transfer of the foster-care-placement or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding to Tribal court as provided by 25 U.S.C. 1911 and § 23.115.

          (vii) The mailing addresses and telephone numbers of the court and information related to all parties to the child-custody proceeding and individuals notified under this section.

          (viii) The potential legal consequences of the child-custody proceedings on the future parental and custodial rights of the parent or Indian custodian.

          (ix) That all parties notified must keep confidential the information contained in the notice and the notice should not be handled by anyone not needing the information to exercise rights under ICWA.

          (e) If the identity or location of the child's parents, the child's Indian custodian, or the Tribes in which the Indian child is a member or eligible for membership cannot be ascertained, but there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, notice of the child-custody proceeding must be sent to the appropriate Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional Director (see ). To establish Tribal identity, as much information as is known regarding the child's direct lineal ancestors should be provided. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will not make a determination of Tribal membership but may, in some instances, be able to identify Tribes to contact.

          (f) If there is a reason to know that a parent or Indian custodian possesses limited English proficiency and is therefore not likely to understand the contents of the notice, the court must provide language access services as required by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other Federal laws. To secure such translation or interpretation support, a court may contact or direct a party to contact the Indian child's Tribe or the local BIA office for assistance in locating and obtaining the name of a qualified translator or interpreter.

          (g) If a parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child appears in court without an attorney, the court must inform him or her of his or her rights, including any applicable right to appointed counsel, right to request that the child-custody proceeding be transferred to Tribal court, right to object to such transfer, right to request additional time to prepare for the child-custody proceeding as provided in § 23.112, and right (if the parent or Indian custodian is not already a party) to intervene in the child-custody proceedings.

          § 23.112   What time limits and extensions apply?

#### § § 23.112

          (a) No foster-care-placement or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding may be held until at least 10 days after receipt of the notice by the parent (or Indian custodian) and by the Tribe (or the Secretary). The parent, Indian custodian, and Tribe each have a right, upon request, to be granted up to 20 additional days from the date upon which notice was received to prepare for participation in the proceeding.

          (b) Except as provided in 25 U.S.C. 1922 and § 23.113, no child-custody proceeding for foster-care placement or termination of parental rights may be held until the waiting periods to which the parents or Indian custodians and to which the Indian child's Tribe are entitled have expired, as follows:

          (1) 10 days after each parent or Indian custodian (or Secretary where the parent or Indian custodian is unknown to the petitioner) has received notice of that particular child-custody proceeding in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1912(a) and § 23.111;

          (2) 10 days after the Indian child's Tribe (or the Secretary if the Indian child's Tribe is unknown to the party seeking placement) has received notice of that particular child-custody proceeding in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1912(a) and § 23.111;

          (3) Up to 30 days after the parent or Indian custodian has received notice of that particular child-custody proceeding in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1912(a) and § 23.111, if the parent or Indian custodian has requested up to 20 additional days to prepare for the child-custody proceeding as provided in 25 U.S.C. 1912(a) and § 23.111; and

          (4) Up to 30 days after the Indian child's Tribe has received notice of that particular child-custody proceeding in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1912(a) and § 23.111, if the Indian child's Tribe has requested up to 20 additional days to prepare for the child-custody proceeding.

          (c) Additional time beyond the minimum required by 25 U.S.C. 1912 and § 23.111 may also be available under State law or pursuant to extensions granted by the court.

          § 23.113   What are the standards for emergency proceedings involving an Indian child?

#### § § 23.113

          (a) Any emergency removal or placement of an Indian child under State law must terminate immediately when the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

          (b) The State court must:

          (1) Make a finding on the record that the emergency removal or placement is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child;

          (2) Promptly hold a hearing on whether the emergency removal or placement continues to be necessary whenever new information indicates that the emergency situation has ended; and

          (3) At any court hearing during the emergency proceeding, determine whether the emergency removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

          (4) Immediately terminate (or ensure that the agency immediately terminates) the emergency proceeding once the court or agency possesses sufficient evidence to determine that the emergency removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

          (c) An emergency proceeding can be terminated by one or more of the following actions:

          (1) Initiation of a child-custody proceeding subject to the provisions of ICWA;

          (2) Transfer of the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian Tribe; or

          (3) Restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian.

          (d) A petition for a court order authorizing the emergency removal or continued emergency placement, or its accompanying documents, should contain a statement of the risk of imminent physical damage or harm to the Indian child and any evidence that the emergency removal or placement continues to be necessary to prevent such imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The petition or its accompanying documents should also contain the following information:

          (1) The name, age, and last known address of the Indian child;

          (2) The name and address of the child's parents and Indian custodians, if any;

          (3) The steps taken to provide notice to the child's parents, custodians, and Tribe about the emergency proceeding;

          (4) If the child's parents and Indian custodians are unknown, a detailed explanation of what efforts have been made to locate and contact them, including contact with the appropriate BIA Regional Director (see );

          (5) The residence and the domicile of the Indian child;

          (6) If either the residence or the domicile of the Indian child is believed to be on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village, the name of the Tribe affiliated with that reservation or village;

          (7) The Tribal affiliation of the child and of the parents or Indian custodians;

          (8) A specific and detailed account of the circumstances that led the agency responsible for the emergency removal of the child to take that action;

          (9) If the child is believed to reside or be domiciled on a reservation where the Tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction over child-custody matters, a statement of efforts that have been made and are being made to contact the Tribe and transfer the child to the Tribe's jurisdiction; and

          (10) A statement of the efforts that have been taken to assist the parents or Indian custodians so the Indian child may safely be returned to their custody.

          (e) An emergency proceeding regarding an Indian child should not be continued for more than 30 days unless the court makes the following determinations:

          (1) Restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent physical damage or harm;

          (2) The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian Tribe; and

          (3) It has not been possible to initiate a “child-custody proceeding” as defined in § 23.2.

          § 23.114   What are the requirements for determining improper removal?

#### § § 23.114

          (a) If, in the course of any child-custody proceeding, any party asserts or the court has reason to believe that the Indian child may have been improperly removed from the custody of his or her parent or Indian custodian, or that the Indian child has been improperly retained (such as after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of custody), the court must expeditiously determine whether there was improper removal or retention.

          (b) If the court finds that the Indian child was improperly removed or retained, the court must terminate the proceeding and the child must be returned immediately to his or her parent or Indian custodian, unless returning the child to his parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger.

        Petitions To Transfer to Tribal Court

          § 23.115   How are petitions for transfer of a proceeding made?

#### § § 23.115

          (a) Either parent, the Indian custodian, or the Indian child's Tribe may request, at any time, orally on the record or in writing, that the State court transfer a foster-care or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding to the jurisdiction of the child's Tribe.

          (b) The right to request a transfer is available at any stage in each foster-care or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding.

          § 23.116   What happens after a petition for transfer is made?

#### § § 23.116

          Upon receipt of a transfer petition, the State court must ensure that the Tribal court is promptly notified in writing of the transfer petition. This notification may request a timely response regarding whether the Tribal court wishes to decline the transfer.

          § 23.117   What are the criteria for ruling on transfer petitions?

#### § § 23.117

          Upon receipt of a transfer petition from an Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or Tribe, the State court must transfer the child-custody proceeding unless the court determines that transfer is not appropriate because one or more of the following criteria are met:

          (a) Either parent objects to such transfer;

          (b) The Tribal court declines the transfer; or

          (c) Good cause exists for denying the transfer.

          § 23.118   How is a determination of “good cause” to deny transfer made?

#### § § 23.118

          (a) If the State court believes, or any party asserts, that good cause to deny transfer exists, the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing on the record and to the parties to the child-custody proceeding.

          (b) Any party to the child-custody proceeding must have the opportunity to provide the court with views regarding whether good cause to deny transfer exists.

          (c) In determining whether good cause exists, the court must not consider:

          (1) Whether the foster-care or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding is at an advanced stage if the Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or Tribe did not receive notice of the child-custody proceeding until an advanced stage;

          (2) Whether there have been prior proceedings involving the child for which no petition to transfer was filed;

          (3) Whether transfer could affect the placement of the child;

          (4) The Indian child's cultural connections with the Tribe or its reservation; or

          (5) Socioeconomic conditions or any negative perception of Tribal or BIA social services or judicial systems.

          (d) The basis for any State-court decision to deny transfer should be stated orally on the record or in a written order.

          § 23.119   What happens after a petition for transfer is granted?

#### § § 23.119

          (a) If the Tribal court accepts the transfer, the State court should expeditiously provide the Tribal court with all records related to the proceeding, including, but not limited to, the pleadings and any court record.

          (b) The State court should work with the Tribal court to ensure that the transfer of the custody of the Indian child and of the proceeding is accomplished smoothly and in a way that minimizes the disruption of services to the family.

        Adjudication of Involuntary Proceedings

          § 23.120   How does the State court ensure that active efforts have been made?

#### § § 23.120

          (a) Prior to ordering an involuntary foster-care placement or termination of parental rights, the court must conclude that active efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts have been unsuccessful.

          (b) Active efforts must be documented in detail in the record.

          § 23.121   What are the applicable standards of evidence?

#### § § 23.121

          (a) The court must not order a foster-care placement of an Indian child unless clear and convincing evidence is presented, including the testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses, demonstrating that the child's continued custody by the child's parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

          (b) The court must not order a termination of parental rights for an Indian child unless evidence beyond a reasonable doubt is presented, including the testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses, demonstrating that the child's continued custody by the child's parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

          (c) For a foster-care placement or termination of parental rights, the evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likelihood that continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the particular child who is the subject of the child-custody proceeding.

          (d) Without a causal relationship identified in paragraph (c) of this section, evidence that shows only the existence of community or family poverty, isolation, single parenthood, custodian age, crowded or inadequate housing, substance abuse, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself constitute clear and convincing evidence or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

          § 23.122   Who may serve as a qualified expert witness?

#### § § 23.122

          (a) A qualified expert witness must be qualified to testify regarding whether the child's continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child and should be qualified to testify as to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's Tribe. A person may be designated by the Indian child's Tribe as being qualified to testify to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's Tribe.

          (b) The court or any party may request the assistance of the Indian child's Tribe or the BIA office serving the Indian child's Tribe in locating persons qualified to serve as expert witnesses.

          (c) The social worker regularly assigned to the Indian child may not serve as a qualified expert witness in child-custody proceedings concerning the child.

          § 23.123   [Reserved]

#### § § 23.123

        Voluntary Proceedings

          § 23.124   What actions must a State court undertake in voluntary proceedings?

#### § § 23.124

          (a) The State court must require the participants in a voluntary proceeding to state on the record whether the child is an Indian child, or whether there is reason to believe the child is an Indian child, as provided in § 23.107.

          (b) If there is reason to believe the child is an Indian child, the State court must ensure that the party seeking placement has taken all reasonable steps to verify the child's status. This may include contacting the Tribe of which it is believed the child is a member (or eligible for membership and of which the biological parent is a member) to verify the child's status. As described in § 23.107, where a consenting parent requests anonymity, a Tribe receiving such information must keep relevant documents and information confidential.

          (c) State courts must ensure that the placement for the Indian child complies with §§ 23.129-23.132.

          § 23.125   How is consent obtained?

#### § § 23.125

          (a) A parent's or Indian custodian's consent to a voluntary termination of parental rights or to a foster-care, preadoptive, or adoptive placement must be executed in writing and recorded before a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (b) Prior to accepting the consent, the court must explain to the parent or Indian custodian:

          (1) The terms and consequences of the consent in detail; and

          (2) The following limitations, applicable to the type of child-custody proceeding for which consent is given, on withdrawal of consent:

          (i) For consent to foster-care placement, the parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent for any reason, at any time, and have the child returned; or

          (ii) For consent to termination of parental rights, the parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent for any reason, at any time prior to the entry of the final decree of termination and have the child returned; or

          (iii) For consent to an adoptive placement, the parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent for any reason, at any time prior to the entry of the final decree of adoption, and have the child returned.

          (c) The court must certify that the terms and consequences of the consent were explained on the record in detail in English (or the language of the parent or Indian custodian, if English is not the primary language) and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian.

          (d) Where confidentiality is requested or indicated, execution of consent need not be made in a session of court open to the public but still must be made before a court of competent jurisdiction in compliance with this section.

          (e) A consent given prior to, or within 10 days after, the birth of an Indian child is not valid.

          § 23.126   What information must a consent document contain?

#### § § 23.126

          (a) If there are any conditions to the consent, the written consent must clearly set out the conditions.

          (b) A written consent to foster-care placement should contain, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the name and birthdate of the Indian child; the name of the Indian child's Tribe; the Tribal enrollment number for the parent and for the Indian child, where known, or some other indication of the child's membership in the Tribe; the name, address, and other identifying information of the consenting parent or Indian custodian; the name and address of the person or entity, if any, who arranged the placement; and the name and address of the prospective foster parents, if known at the time.

          § 23.127   How is withdrawal of consent to a foster-care placement achieved?

#### § § 23.127

          (a) The parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to voluntary foster-care placement at any time.

          (b) To withdraw consent, the parent or Indian custodian must file a written document with the court or otherwise testify before the court. Additional methods of withdrawing consent may be available under State law.

          (c) When a parent or Indian custodian withdraws consent to a voluntary foster-care placement, the court must ensure that the Indian child is returned to that parent or Indian custodian as soon as practicable.

          § 23.128   How is withdrawal of consent to a termination of parental rights or adoption achieved?

        Dispositions

          § 23.129   When do the placement preferences apply?

#### § § 23.129

          (a) In any preadoptive, adoptive, or foster-care placement of an Indian child, the placement preferences specified in § 23.130 and § 23.131 apply.

          (b) Where a consenting parent requests anonymity in a voluntary proceeding, the court must give weight to the request in applying the preferences.

          (c) The placement preferences must be applied in any foster-care, preadoptive, or adoptive placement unless there is a determination on the record that good cause under § 23.132 exists to not apply those placement preferences.

          § 23.130   What placement preferences apply in adoptive placements?

#### § § 23.130

          (a) In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, where the Indian child's Tribe has not established a different order of preference under paragraph (b) of this section, preference must be given in descending order, as listed below, to placement of the child with:

          (1) A member of the Indian child's extended family;

          (2) Other members of the Indian child's Tribe; or

          (3) Other Indian families.

          (b) If the Indian child's Tribe has established by resolution a different order of preference than that specified in ICWA, the Tribe's placement preferences apply.

          (c) The court must, where appropriate, also consider the placement preference of the Indian child or Indian child's parent.

          § 23.131   What placement preferences apply in foster-care or preadoptive placements?

#### § § 23.131

          (a) In any foster-care or preadoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, including changes in foster-care or preadoptive placements, the child must be placed in the least-restrictive setting that:

          (1) Most approximates a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment;

          (2) Allows the Indian child's special needs (if any) to be met; and

          (3) Is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home, extended family, or siblings.

          (b) In any foster-care or preadoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, where the Indian child's Tribe has not established a different order of preference under paragraph (c) of this section, preference must be given, in descending order as listed below, to placement of the child with:

          (1) A member of the Indian child's extended family;

          (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's Tribe;

          (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or

          (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the child's needs.

          (c) If the Indian child's Tribe has established by resolution a different order of preference than that specified in ICWA, the Tribe's placement preferences apply, so long as the placement is the least-restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (d) The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian child's parent.

          § 23.132   How is a determination of “good cause” to depart from the placement preferences made?

#### § § 23.132

          (a) If any party asserts that good cause not to follow the placement preferences exists, the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the child-custody proceeding and the court.

          (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences should bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that there is “good cause” to depart from the placement preferences.

          (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made on the record or in writing and should be based on one or more of the following considerations:

          (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child's parents, if they attest that they have reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference;

          (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision that is being made;

          (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular placement;

          (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the placement preferences live;

          (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but none has been located. For purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.

          (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any placement relative to another placement.

          (e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that flowed from time spent in a non-preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA.

        Access

          § 23.133   Should courts allow participation by alternative methods?

#### § § 23.133

          If it possesses the capability, the court should allow alternative methods of participation in State-court child-custody proceedings involving an Indian child, such as participation by telephone, videoconferencing, or other methods.

          § 23.134   Who has access to reports and records during a proceeding?

#### § § 23.134

          Each party to an emergency proceeding or a foster-care-placement or termination-of-parental-rights proceeding under State law involving an Indian child has a right to timely examine all reports and other documents filed or lodged with the court upon which any decision with respect to such action may be based.

#### § § 23.136

          (a) Within two years after a final decree of adoption of any Indian child by a State court, or within any longer period of time permitted by the law of the State, the State court may invalidate the voluntary adoption upon finding that the parent's consent was obtained by fraud or duress.

          (b) Upon the parent's filing of a petition to vacate the final decree of adoption of the parent's Indian child, the court must give notice to all parties to the adoption proceedings and the Indian child's Tribe and must hold a hearing on the petition.

          (c) Where the court finds that the parent's consent was obtained through fraud or duress, the court must vacate the final decree of adoption, order the consent revoked, and order that the child be returned to the parent.

          § 23.137   Who can petition to invalidate an action for certain ICWA violations?

#### § § 23.137

          (a) Any of the following may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate an action for foster-care placement or termination of parental rights under state law where it is alleged that 25 U.S.C. 1911, 1912, or 1913 has been violated:

          (1) An Indian child who is or was the subject of any action for foster-care placement or termination of parental rights;

          (2) A parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed; and

          (3) The Indian child's Tribe.

          (b) Upon a showing that an action for foster-care placement or termination of parental rights violated any provision of 25 U.S.C. 1911, 1912, or 1913, the court must determine whether it is appropriate to invalidate the action.

          (c) To petition for invalidation, there is no requirement that the petitioner's rights under ICWA were violated; rather, a petitioner may challenge the action based on any violations of 25 U.S.C. 1911, 1912, or 1913 during the course of the child-custody proceeding.

          § 23.138   What are the rights to information about adoptees' Tribal affiliations?

#### § § 23.138

          Upon application by an Indian who has reached age 18 who was the subject of an adoptive placement, the court that entered the final decree of adoption must inform such individual of the Tribal affiliations, if any, of the individual's biological parents and provide such other information necessary to protect any rights, which may include Tribal membership, resulting from the individual's Tribal relationship.

          § 23.139   Must notice be given of a change in an adopted Indian child's status?

#### § § 23.139

          (a) If an Indian child has been adopted, the court must notify, by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, the child's biological parent or prior Indian custodian and the Indian child's Tribe whenever:

          (1) A final decree of adoption of the Indian child has been vacated or set aside; or

          (2) The adoptive parent has voluntarily consented to the termination of his or her parental rights to the child.

          (b) The notice must state the current name, and any former name, of the Indian child, inform the recipient of the right to petition for return of custody of the child, and provide sufficient information to allow the recipient to participate in any scheduled hearings.

          (c) A parent or Indian custodian may waive his or her right to such notice by executing a written waiver of notice and filing the waiver with the court.

          (1) Prior to accepting the waiver, the court must explain the consequences of the waiver and explain how the waiver may be revoked.

          (2) The court must certify that the terms and consequences of the waiver and how the waiver may be revoked were explained in detail in English (or the language of the parent or Indian custodian, if English is not the primary language), and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian.

          (3) Where confidentiality is requested or indicated, execution of the waiver need not be made in a session of court open to the public but still must be made before a court of competent jurisdiction in compliance with this section.

          (4) The biological parent or Indian custodian may revoke the waiver at any time by filing with the court a written notice of revocation.

          (5) A revocation of the right to receive notice does not affect any child-custody proceeding that was completed before the filing of the notice of revocation.

        (ii) Disaggregation is not required in the cases in which the number of students in a subgroup is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;

        (10) Enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported, consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to BIE-funded schools, so that parents, teachers, principals, other school leaders, and administrators can interpret and address the specific academic needs of students as indicated by the students' achievement on assessment items; and

        (11) Be designed and developed:

        (i) To be valid and accessible for use by all students, including students with disabilities and English learners; and

        (ii) To the extent practicable, using the principles of universal design for learning. For the purposes of this section, “universal design for learning” means a scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice that:

        (A) Provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and

        (B) Reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations, supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement expectations for all students, including students with disabilities and English learners.

        (c)  The BIE will determine the use of this exemption in the Agency Plan.

        (d)  (1) BIE retains the right to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments as the assessments described in this section, provided the computer adaptive assessments meet the requirements of this section, except that:

        (i) The requirement that the same academic assessments must be used to measure the achievement of all BIE-funded school students and that the assessments must be administered to all BIE-funded school students may not be interpreted to require that all students taking the computer adaptive assessment be administered the same assessment items; and

        (ii) Such assessment:

        (A) Must measure, at a minimum, each student's academic proficiency based on the challenging academic standards for the student's grade level and growth toward such standards; and

        (B) May measure the student's level of academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student's grade level, including for use as part of the accountability system.

        (2) In developing and administering computer adaptive assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and English learners:

        (i) The BIE will ensure that the computer adaptive assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities:

        (A) Assess a student's academic achievement based on the challenging academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;

        (B) Meet the requirements of this section and §§ 30.106 through 30.110, including § 30.108, except the assessments are not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and

        (C) Assess the student's academic achievement to measure, in the subject being assessed, whether the student is performing at the student's grade level; and

        (ii) The BIE may provide for the use of computer adaptive assessments that:

        (A) Meet the requirements §§ 30.106 through 30.110 except the assessments are not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and

        (B) Assess the student's English language proficiency, which may include growth towards such proficiency, in order to measure the student's acquisition of English.

        (e)  (1) The BIE assessments required by these regulations must undergo peer review with the exception of tribal civics and non-content Native American language academic assessments.

        (2) BIE will develop guidance on the use of academic assessments in a Native American language for purposes of compliance with these regulatory requirements, including evidence of technical validity and reliability, in consultation with the Department of Education, Tribes, and other stakeholders.

        (f)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preempting tribal law at a tribally controlled school regarding the decision of a parent to not have the parent's child participate in the academic assessments under this paragraph (f).

        (g)  The Secretary may set a target limit on the aggregate amount of time devoted to the administration of assessments for each grade, expressed as a percentage of annual instructional hours.

        (h)  The BIE is not required to assess, using an assessment written in English, student achievement in meeting the BIE's challenging State academic standards in reading/language arts, mathematics, or science for a student who is enrolled in a school or program that provides instruction primarily in a Native American language if:

        (1) The program or school provides an assessment in the Native American language to all students in the program or school and:

        (i) Submits evidence to the BIE according to BIE guidelines developed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section regarding such assessment's technical validity and reliability for the purposes for which it is intended; and

        (ii) BIE submits this evidence to Department of Education for approval; and

        (2) For an English learner the BIE continues to assess the English language proficiency of such English learner, using the annual English language proficiency assessment required under § 30.110, and provides appropriate services to enable him or her to attain proficiency in English.

        § 30.106   How will the Secretary provide for the inclusion of all students in assessments?

#### § § 30.106

        The Secretary will provide assessment instruments that allow for:

        (a) The participation of all students, generally;

        (b) The participation of students with disabilities, as detailed in §§ 30.107 and 30.108; and

        (c) The participation of English learners, as detailed in § 30.109.

        § 30.107   How will the Secretary include students with disabilities in assessments?

#### § § 30.107

        (a) The BIE and BIE-funded schools must ensure that students with disabilities have the appropriate accommodations, such as interoperability with, and ability to use, assistive technology, for students with disabilities, including students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, necessary to measure the academic achievement of such children relative to the BIE's challenging academic standards or alternate academic achievement standards described in § 30.104(d) and (e).

        (b) The Secretary must include students with disabilities in all assessments, with appropriate accommodations. For purposes of this section, students with disabilities, collectively, are:

        (1) All children with disabilities as defined under section 602(3) of the IDEA;

        (2) Students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who are identified from among the students in paragraph (a) of this section; and

        (3) Students with disabilities covered under other acts, including:

        (i) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and

        (ii) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended.

        (c) Appropriate accommodations for those students described in paragraph (b) of this section will be determined by:

        (1) For each student under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the student's IEP team;

        (2) For each student under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the student's placement team; or

        (3) For each student under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the individual or team designated by the school to make these decisions.

        (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a student with a disability must be assessed with an assessment aligned with the BIE's challenging academic standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled.

        (2) A student with the most significant cognitive disabilities may be assessed with:

        (i) The general assessment under § 30.106(b); or

        (ii) The alternate assessment under § 30.108 aligned with the BIE's challenging academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and the BIE's alternate academic achievement standards.

        (e) The BIE and school must ensure that general and special education teachers, paraprofessionals, teachers of English learners, specialized instructional support personnel, and other appropriate staff receive necessary training to administer assessments and know how to administer assessments, including, as necessary, alternate assessments, and know how to make use of appropriate accommodations during assessment for all students with disabilities, consistent with section 1111(b)(2)(B)(vii)(III) of the Act.

        (f) The BIE and school must ensure that the use of appropriate accommodations under paragraph (c) of this section does not deny a student with a disability:

        (1) The opportunity to participate in the assessment; and

        (2) Any of the benefits from participation in the assessment that are afforded to students without disabilities.

        § 30.108   How will the Secretary provide for alternate assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities?

#### § § 30.108

        (a)  The BIE will provide for alternate assessments aligned with the challenging academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and alternate academic achievement standards described in § 30.104(d) and (e) for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. The BIE must:

        (1) Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, ensure that, for each subject, the total number of students assessed in the subject using the alternate assessments does not exceed one (1) percent of the total number of all students in all BIE-funded schools who are assessed in the subject;

        (2) With regard to the percentage of students assessed under this paragraph (a):

        (i) Not prohibit a BIE-funded school from assessing more than one (1) percent of its assessed students in any subject for which assessments are administered with an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards;

        (ii) Require that the BIE-funded school submit by October 1 information into the BIE's student information system regarding what assessment the student is to take and which must be consistent with the individualized education program (IEP);

        (iii) Provide appropriate oversight of a BIE-funded school that is required to submit information to the BIE; and

        (iv) Make the information submitted by a BIE-funded school under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section publicly available, provided that such information does not reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;

        (3) With regard to IEP teams:

        (i) Establish clear and appropriate guidelines, consistent with section 612(a)(16)(C) of the IDEA, and provide technical assistance as requested in writing, and monitor implementation of clear and appropriate guidelines for IEP teams to apply in determining, on a case-by-case basis, which students with the most significant cognitive disabilities will be assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards. Such guidelines must include a BIE definition of “students with the most significant cognitive disabilities” that addresses factors related to cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior, such that:

        (A) The identification of a student as having a particular disability as defined in the IDEA or as an English learner does not determine whether a student is a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities;

        (B) A student with the most significant cognitive disabilities is not identified solely on the basis of the student's previous low academic achievement, or the student's previous need for accommodations to participate in general BIE assessments; and

        (C) A student is identified as having the most significant cognitive disabilities because the student requires extensive, direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gains on the BIE's challenging academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled; and

        (ii) Provide to IEP teams a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of BIE and BIE-funded school policies on a student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards, such as how participation in such assessments may delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma;

        (4) Ensure that the parents of such students are clearly informed, as part of the process for developing the individualized education program (as defined in section 614(d)(1)(A) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A))):

        (i) That their child's academic achievement will be measured based on the alternate academic achievement standards; and

        (ii) How participation in the assessments may delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma;

        (5) Promote, consistent with the IDEA (20 U.S.C. 1400 ), the involvement and progress of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the general education curriculum;

        (6) Describe the steps the Bureau has taken to incorporate universal design for learning, to the extent feasible, in alternate assessments;

        (7) Describe that general and special education teachers, and other appropriate staff:

        (i) Know how to administer the alternate assessments; and

        (ii) Make appropriate use of accommodations for students with disabilities on all assessments required under this paragraph (a);

        (8) Develop, disseminate information on, and promote the use of appropriate accommodations to increase the number of students with significant cognitive disabilities:

        (i) Participating in academic instruction and assessments for the grade level in which the student is enrolled; and

        (ii) Who are tested based on the BIE's challenging academic standards for the grade level in which the student is enrolled; and

        (9) Not preclude a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities who takes an alternate assessment based on alternate academic achievement standards from attempting to complete the requirements for a regular high school diploma.

        (b)  Subject to the authority and requirements for the IEP team for a child with a disability under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb)), such team, consistent with the guidelines established by the BIE and required under section 612(a)(16)(C) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(C)) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, will determine when a child with a significant cognitive disability may participate in an alternate assessment aligned with the alternate academic achievement standards.

        § 30.109   How will the Secretary include English learners in academic content assessments?

#### § § 30.109

        (a)  English learners must be:

        (1) Assessed in a valid and reliable manner; and

        (2) Provided appropriate accommodations on assessments administered including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what the students know and can do in academic content areas, until the students have achieved English language proficiency, consistent with standardized BIE-determined exit procedures.

        (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, BIE-funded schools must provide for assessments (using tests in English) of reading or language arts of any student who has attended school in the United States for three (3) or more consecutive school years, except that if the BIE-funded school determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that academic assessments in another language or form would likely yield more accurate and reliable information on what the student knows and can do, the BIE-funded school may make a determination to assess the student in the appropriate language other than English for a period that does not exceed two (2) additional consecutive years, provided that the student has not yet reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what the student knows and can do on tests (written in English) of reading or language arts. This requirement does not permit either the BIE or BIE-funded schools to exempt English learners from participating in the BIE's assessment system.

        (c)  The BIE must:

        (1) Disseminate information and resources regarding English learners to, at a minimum, BIE-funded schools, and parents;

        (2) Promote the use of accommodations for English learners to ensure that all English learners are able to participate in academic instruction and assessments; and

        (3) Provide technical assistance when requested in writing.

        (d)  With respect to recently arrived English learners who have been enrolled in a school in one of the 50 States in the United States or the District of Columbia for less than twelve (12) months, the BIE may choose to:

        (1) Exclude:

        (i) The English learner from one administration of the reading or language arts assessment required under § 30.105; and

        (ii) The English learner's results on any of the assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) or § 30.110 for the first year of the English learner's enrollment in the school for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system under § 30.111; or

        (2) Assess, and report the performance of:

        (i) The English learner on the reading or language arts and mathematics assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) in each year of the student's enrollment in such a school; and

        (ii) For the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system:

        (A) For the first year of the student's enrollment in the school, exclude the results on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;

        (B) Include a measure of student growth on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section in the second year of the student's enrollment in the school; and

        (C) Include proficiency on the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics described in this paragraph (d) in the third year of the student's enrollment in such a school, and each succeeding year of enrollment.

        (e)  With respect to a student previously identified as an English learner and for not more than four (4) years after the student ceases to be identified as an English learner, the BIE may include the results of the student's academic content assessments within the English learner subgroup of the subgroups of students as defined in § 30.101 for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system.

        § 30.110   How will the Secretary ensure BIE-funded schools will provide for annual assessments of English language proficiency for English learners?

#### § § 30.110

        (a) The BIE will ensure that BIE-funded schools will administer a valid and reliable annual assessment of English proficiency to all English learners in the schools served by the BIE.

        (b) The BIE will require BIE-funded schools to use the assessment to assess annually the English language proficiency, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, of all English learners in kindergarten through grade twelve (12).

        (c) The English language proficiency assessment must be aligned with the BIE's English language proficiency standards described in § 30.104(f).

        (d) The assessment will be implemented, developed, and used consistent with the requirements of this section.

        (e) The assessment will provide coherent and timely information about each student's attainment of the BIE's English language proficiency standards to parents.

        (f) If an English learner has a disability that precludes assessment of the student in one or more domains of the English language proficiency assessment such that there are no appropriate accommodations for the affected domain(s) ( a non-verbal English learner who because of an identified disability cannot take the speaking portion of the assessment), as determined, on an individualized basis, by the student's IEP team, 504 team, or by the individual or team designated by the BIE-funded school to make these decisions under title II of the ADA, then the BIE must assess the student's English language proficiency based on the remaining domains in which it is possible to assess the student.

        (g) The BIE must provide for an alternate English language proficiency assessment for English learners with the most significant cognitive disabilities who cannot participate in the assessment under this paragraph (g) even with appropriate accommodations.

        (h) BIE will provide technical assistance, including training teachers on how to administer assessments, in regard to English language proficiency assessments and alternate English language proficiency assessments to BIE-funded schools as requested in writing.

        § 30.111   How will the Secretary implement requirements for an accountability system?

#### § § 30.111

        (a) The Secretary will define accountability system for BIE-funded schools consistent with this section and subpart C of this part, including provisions for a single Bureau-wide accountability system and system of support and improvement activities, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of BIE-funded schools and the students served by BIE-funded schools.

        (b) To improve student academic achievement and school success among all elementary and secondary schools within the BIE-funded school system, the Secretary will develop and implement a single, Bureau-wide accountability system that:

        (1) Is based on the Bureau's challenging academic standards and academic assessments;

        (2) Is informed by ambitious long-term goals and measurements of interim progress;

        (3) Includes all the accountability indicators described paragraph (e) of this section;

        (4) Takes into account the achievement of all elementary and secondary school students within the BIE-funded school system;

        (5) Is the same accountability system used to annually, meaningfully differentiate all schools within the BIE-funded school system and the same accountability system used to identify schools for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement; and

        (6) Includes the process that the Bureau will use to ensure effective development and implementation of school support and improvement plans, including evidence-based interventions, to hold all schools within the BIE-funded school system accountable for student academic achievement and school success.

        (c) The inclusion of science and tribal civics will be phased into the Secretary's requirements for accountability system starting as a school quality or student success indicator and their continued use in such manner will be revisited as the accountability system is implemented.

        (d) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will establish long-term goals and measurements of interim progress that will include, at a minimum, improved academic achievement, as measured by proficiency on the Bureau's annual assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts under § 30.105(b)(5)(i), and high school graduation rates, including the four (4)-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, or at BIE's discretion one or more extended year graduation cohorts, and that will:

        (1) Use the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system to meet the goals; and

        (2) Take into account, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measurements of academic achievement and high school graduations rates, the improvement necessary to make significant progress in closing Bureau-wide proficiency and graduation rate gaps.

        (e) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will include a long-term goal and measurements of interim progress for increases in the percentage of English learner students making progress in achieving English language proficiency as defined by the Secretary and measured by the assessments under § 30.110 within a timeline determined by the Bureau.

        (f) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students the Bureau will establish and annually measure the following accountability indicators:

        (1) For all schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section, academic achievement:

        (i) As measured by proficiency on the annual assessments of mathematics and reading or language arts described in § 30.105(b)(5)(i); and

        (ii) At the BIE's discretion, for each high school, growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

        (2) For elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools:

        (i) A measure of student growth, if determined to be appropriate by the BIE; or

        (ii) Another valid and reliable Bureau-wide academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.

        (3) For high schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section:

        (i) The four (4)-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and

        (ii) At the BIE's discretion, the extended-year adjusted graduation cohort rate, as defined in paragraph (j) of this section.

        (4) For all schools, progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the BIE and measured by the assessments of English language proficiency described in § 30.110, within a BIE-determined timeline for all English learners:

        (i) In each of grades three (3) through eight (8); and

        (ii) In the high school grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed in mathematics and reading or language arts.

        (5) For all schools, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that:

        (i) Allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance;

        (ii) Is valid, reliable, comparable, and Bureau-wide (with the same indicator or indicators used for each grade span, as such term is determined by the BIE); and

        (iii) May include one or more of the following measures:

        (A) Student or Educator engagement;

        (B) Chronic absenteeism;

        (C) Student access to and completion of advanced coursework;

        (D) Postsecondary readiness;

        (E) School climate and safety; and

        (F) Any other indicator the BIE chooses that meets the requirements of this section.

        (g) The BIE will establish a system for meaningfully differentiating, annually, all schools that will:

        (1) Be based on all indicators described paragraph (f) of this section for all students and for each subgroup of students; and

        (2) With respect to paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, afford:

        (i) Substantial weight to each such indicator;

        (ii) In the aggregate, much greater weight than is afforded to the indicator or indicators utilized by the BIE and described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, in the aggregate; and

        (iii) Include differentiation of any such school in which any subgroup of students is consistently underperforming, as determined by the BIE, based on all indicators described in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (h) Based on the system of meaningful differentiation described in paragraph (g) of this section, the BIE will establish a methodology to identify:

        (1) Beginning with the first full school year following April 27, 2020, and at least once every three (3) years thereafter, one (1) BIE-wide category of schools for comprehensive support and improvement, which will include:

        (i) Not less than the lowest-performing five (5) percent of all schools receiving Title I funding;

        (ii) All high schools failing to graduate one third ( ) or more of their students; and

        (iii) All schools identified for additional targeted support and improvement that receive ESEA Title I funding and do not meet exit criteria as provided in § 30.124(a)(2).

        (2) The BIE will provide technical assistance to all schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement, targeted support and improvement, or additional targeted support.

        (i) The Bureau's accountability system will annually measure the achievement of at least ninety-five (95) percent of all students, and ninety-five (95) percent of each subgroup of students, who are enrolled in a school within the BIE-funded school system on the Bureau's assessments. The denominator for the purpose of measuring, calculating, and reporting on the academic achievement indicator will be the greater of:

        (1) Ninety-five (95) percent of all students, or ninety-five (95) percent of each subgroup of students; or

        (2) The number of students participating in the assessments.

        (j) The performance of students that have not attended the same BIE-funded school for at least half ( ) of a school year will not be included in the academic achievement, other academic, progress in achieving English language proficiency, or school quality or student success indicators for that school year, but will be used for the purpose of reporting on the Bureau and school report cards for that school year.

        (k) Extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate means the fraction—

        (1) The denominator of which consists of the number of students who form the original cohort of entering first-time students in grade nine (9) enrolled in the high school, adjusted by—

        (i) Adding the students who joined that cohort, after the date of the determination of the original cohort; and

        (ii) Subtracting only those students who left that cohort, after the date of the determination of the original cohort, as described in paragraph (l) of this section; and

        (2) The numerator of which—

        (i) Consists of the sum of—

        (A) The number of students in the cohort, as adjusted under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, who earned a regular high school diploma before, during, or at the conclusion of—

        () One or more additional years beyond the fourth year of high school; or

        () A summer session immediately following the additional year of high school; and

        (B) All students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the cohort, as adjusted under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, assessed using the alternate assessment aligned to alternate academic achievement standards under § 30.108 and awarded an alternate diploma that is—

        () Standards-based;

        () Aligned with the requirements for the regular high school diploma; and

        () Obtained within the time period for which the BIE ensures the availability of a free appropriate public education under 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1); and

        (ii) Does not include any student awarded a recognized equivalent of a diploma, such as a general equivalency diploma, certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or similar lesser credential.

      Subpart B—Accountability, Waiver of Requirements, Technical Assistance, and Approval of Proposals for Alternative Requirements

        § 30.112   May a tribal governing body or school board waive the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system?

#### § § 30.112

        Yes. A tribal governing body or school board may waive the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system in part or in whole, and the tribal governing body or school board's alternative requirements will apply if they meet the requirements of section 1111, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of the applicable school or schools and the students served by such school or schools, and are approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of Education. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Education do not approve the tribal governing body or school board's proposal for alternative requirements, the Secretary's requirements under this part continue to apply. Depending on the nature and content of such proposals for alternative requirements, and subject to the availability of appropriations, alternative requirements will generally be effective in the school year following the school year they are approved. Where a tribal governing body or school board proposes to use existing State requirements, approval of the use of such requirements is dependent upon the agreement of the applicable State.

        § 30.113   How does a tribal governing body or school board waive the Secretary's requirements?

#### § § 30.113

        (a) A tribal governing body or school board may waive the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system, in part or in whole.

        (c) Within sixty (60) days of the decision to waive the Secretary's requirements in part or in whole, the tribal governing body or school board must submit to the Secretary for review and, in coordination with the Secretary of Education, approval, a proposal for alternative requirements that are consistent with section 1111 of the Act, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of the school or schools and the students served. The Secretary encourages a tribal governing body or school board to request and receive technical assistance well in advance of submission of a plan to the Secretary for review. The tribal governing body or school board must continue to follow the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system until a proposal for alternative requirements has been approved and until alternative requirements become effective.

        (d) A tribal governing body or school board may request in writing an extension of the sixty (60) day deadline for the provision of technical assistance.

        (e) A tribal governing body or school board must use this process anytime a tribal governing body or school board proposes alternative requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system, or proposes changes to approved alternative requirements.

        (f) The Secretary will work with the Secretary of Education to develop and make available templates for proposals for alternative requirements that tribal governing bodies and school boards may use to assist in the development of such proposals for alternative requirements.

        § 30.115   May proposed alternative requirements use parts of the Secretary's requirements?

#### § § 30.115

        Yes, a tribal governing body or school board may use the Secretary's requirements in part or in whole. Alternative proposals must clearly identify any retained portions of the Secretary's requirements.

        § 30.116   Will the Secretary provide technical assistance to tribal governing bodies or school boards seeking to develop alternative requirements?

#### § § 30.116

        The Secretary and the Secretary of Education are required by statute to provide technical assistance, upon request, either directly or through contract, to a tribal governing body or a school board that seeks to develop alternative requirements. A tribal governing body or school board seeking such assistance must submit a request in writing to the Director. The Secretary will provide such technical assistance on an ongoing and timely basis.

        § 30.117   What is the process for requesting technical assistance?

#### § § 30.117

        (a) Requests for technical assistance must be in writing from a tribal governing body or school board to the Director of BIE and the Department of Education's Assistant Secretary of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.

        (b) The Director, or designee, will acknowledge receipt of a request for technical assistance.

        (c) No later than thirty (30) days after receiving the original request, the Director will identify a point-of-contact and begin the process of providing technical assistance. The Director and requesting tribal governing body or school board will work together to identify the form, substance, and timeline for the assistance.

#### § § 30.118

        A tribal governing body or school board may request technical assistance in writing at any time. A tribal governing body or school board is welcomed and encouraged to request technical assistance before formally notifying the Secretary of its intention to waive the requirements established by the Secretary in order to maximize the time available for technical assistance.

        § 30.119   How does the Secretary review and approve alternative requirements?

#### § § 30.119

        (a) The Secretary and the Secretary of Education will jointly approve plans for alternative requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system or determine that the proposed alternative requirements do not meet the requirements of section 1111 of the Act.

        (1) The Secretary will consult with the Secretary of Education through the review of a proposal for alternative requirements.

        (2) Upon receipt of a proposal for alternative requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system, in part or in whole, the Secretary will begin coordination with the Secretary of Education on review and approval of the proposal.

        (3) The Secretary will provide a status update regarding the processing of the proposal within 120 days of receipt of the proposal and every thirty (30) days thereafter to discuss the stage of the review process.

        (b) If the Secretary and the Secretary of Education approve a proposal for alternative requirements, the Secretary will:

        (1) Promptly notify the tribal governing body or school board; and

        (2) Indicate the date for which the alternative proposal will be effective.

        (c) If a proposal for alternative requirements is not approved, the tribal governing body or school board will be notified that:

The mission of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Indian Education Programs, is to provide quality education opportunities from early childhood through life in accordance with the Tribes' needs for cultural and economic well-being in keeping with the wide diversity of Indian Tribes and Alaska Native villages as distinct cultural and governmental entities. The Bureau shall manifest consideration of the whole person, taking into account the spiritual, mental, physical and cultural aspects of the person within family and Tribal or Alaska Native village contexts.

      § 38.7   Appointment of educators.

#### § § 38.7

      (a)  Local Bureau school employees shall be appointed only by the school supervisor. Before the local school employee is employed, the school board shall be consulted. An individual's appointment may be finalized only upon receipt of a formal written determination certified by the local school board under such uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board should be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The local school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. The school supervisor may appeal to the ASE, or, where appropriate, to the AEPA, any determination by the local school board concerning an individual's appointment. A written statement of appeal describing the action and the reasons the supervisor believes such action should be overturned must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the action from the local school board. A copy of such statement shall be submitted to the school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, not to exceed 10 calendar days, in writing, to the appeal. After reviewing such written appeal and response, the ASE or AEPA may, for cause, overturn the action of the local school board. The ASE or AEPA must transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the supervisor identifying the reasons for overturning the action within 10 calender days. Failure to act within the 10 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the local school board's determination.

      (b)  School supervisors may be appointed only by the ASE, except the AEPA shall appoint school supervisors for off-reservation boarding schools and those few other schools supervised by the AEPA. The school board shall be consulted before the school supervisor is employed. The appointment may be finalized upon receipt of a formal written determination certified by the school board under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The school board shall use the same procedure to disapprove an appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, may appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the local school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such an appeal. The Director may reverse the determination for cause set out in writing to the school board. Within 20 calendar days of the school board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE or AEPA identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure by the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the school board's determination.

      (c)  Appointments to Agency office education positions may be made only by the ASE. The Agency school board shall be consulted before the agency education employee is employed, and the appointment may be finalized upon receipt of a formal, written determination certified by the Agency school board under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The Agency school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE may appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Agency school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such appeal. After reviewing the written appeal and response, the Director may, for cause, overturn the determination of the Agency school board. Within 20 days of the board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure of the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the school's board's determination.

      (d)  The Bureau shall issue employment contracts each year for individuals employed in contract education positions at the Agency or school levels.

      (e)  Where a local school board has not been established in accordance with section 1139(7) Pub. L. 95-561 with respect to a Bureau school, or where a school board is not operational, and the local school board is required to be given a notice or required to be consulted by statute or these regulations, the official involved shall notify or consult with the Agency school board serving the tribe(s) to which the parents of the Indian children atending that school belong, or, in that absence, the tribal organization(s) of the tribe(s) involved.

      (f)  Provisional certification or other limited certificates from the State are not considered full certification and only a provisional contract may be issued. There may be circumstances when no individual who has met the full certification or experience requirements is available for a professional position or when a status quo employee who does not meet full certification or experience requirements desires to convert to contract. When this situation exists, a provisional contract may be issued in accordance with the following:

      (1) The contract will be made only:

      (i) After it is determined that an individual already meeting certification or experience requirements is not available; or

      (ii) For conversion of a status quo employee who does not yet meet all established position requirements.

      (2) Consultation with the appropriate school board is required prior to the contract.

      (3) The contract may be of 12-month or school-term duration.

      (4) The employee will be required to make satisfactory progress toward meeting full qualification requirements.

      (5) If the employee fails to meet the requirements established under § 38.7(f)(4), the contract will be terminated. Such termination cannot be grieved or appealed.

      (g)  As provided in section 1131(d)(4), Pub. L. 95-561, if an individual who has applied at both the national and local levels is appointed from a local list of applicants, the appointment shall be conditional for 90 days. During that period, the individual's application and background shall be examined to determine if there is a more qualified individual for the position. Removal during this period is not subject to discharge, hearing or grievance procedures.

      (h)  (1) There may be circumstances where immediate action is necessary and it is impossible to consult with the local school board. When this situation exists short-term contracts may be made by the school supervisor in accordance with the following:

      (i) The length of the contract will not exceed 60 days, or the next regularly scheduled school board meeting, whichever comes first.

      (ii) If the board meets and does not take action on the individual in question, the short-term contract may be extended for the duration of the school year.

      (iii) It shall be the responsibility of the school supervisor to fully inform the local school board of all such short-term contracts. Failure to do so may be cited as reason to discharge the school supervisor if so requested by the board.

      (2) The local school board may authorize the school supervisor to make an emergency short-term contract to classroom, dormitory and other positions directly related to the health and safety of students. When this situation exists, short-term contracts may be made in accordance with the following:

      (i) If local and agency lists of qualified applicants are exhausted, short-term contracts may be made without regard to qualifications for the position;

      (ii) The pay level will be based on the qualifications of the individual employed rather than the requirements of the position, if the qualifications of the individual are lower than required;

      (iii) The short-term contract may not exceed the school term and may not be renewed or extended;

      (iv) Every 60 days the school supervisor will determine if qualified individuals have been placed on the local or agency lists. If a qualified individual on the list accepts employment, the school supervisor must terminate the emergency appointment at the time the qualified individual is appointed.

      (i)  There may be circumstances where a specific position is needed for a period of one year or less. Under these conditions a position may be advertised as a temporary position and be filled under a temporary contract. Such contract requires the same school board approval as a school year contract. If required for the completion of the activities specified in the original announcement, the position, may with school board approval be extended for up to one additional year. Temporary contracts may be terminated at any time and this action is not subject to approval or grievance procedures.

      (j)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Indian preference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any personnel action within the purview of this section respecting an application or employee not entitled to Indian preference if each tribal organization concerned grants, in writing, a waiver of the application of such laws with respect to such personnel action, where such a waiver is in writing deemed to be a necessity by the tribal organization, except that this shall in no way relieve the Bureau of its responsibility to issue timely and adequate announcements and advertisements concerning any such personnel action if it is intended to fill a vacancy (no matter how such vacancy is created). When a waiver is granted, it shall apply only to that particular position and as long as the employee remains in that position.

      (k)  An educator who voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the school term may not be appointed to another Bureau education position before the beginning of the following school term. An educator will not be deemed to have voluntarily terminated employment if transferred elsewhere with the consent of the local school or Agency boards.

      (l)  The appropriate school board shall be notified in writing by the school supervisor and/or ASE or AEPA not less than 90 days before the end of the school term whether or not an individual's contract is recommended for renewal.

      (1) If the school board disagrees with the school supervisor's or ASE's or AEPA's recommendations, the board will submit a formal, written certification of its determinations to the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA within 25 days. If the board's determinations are not received within the 25 days, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA shall issue the 60 day notification of renewal or nonrenawal to the individual as required under § 38.8.

      (2) When the school board submits its determination within the 25 days and determines that a contract will be renewed, or nonrenewed, the appropriate official shall issue the required renewal notice, or nonrenawal, or appeal the determination of the school board to the appropriate official who will make a determination in accordance with the appeal procedure is § 38.7(a) of this part. After the probationary period, if the determination is that the contract will not be renewed, the procedures specified in § 38.8 shall apply.

      § 38.8   Nonrenewal of contract.

#### § § 38.8

      Where the determination is made that an employee's contract shall not be renewed for the following year, the following procedure will apply to those employees who have completed three full continuous school terms of service under consecutive contract appointments and satisfactory performance in the same or comparable education positions.

      (a) The employee will be given a written notice of the action and the reasons thereof not less than 60 days before the end of the school term.

      (b) The employee will be given 10 calendar days to request an informal hearing before the appropriate official or body. Upon request, the employee may be given official time, not to exceed eight hours, to prepare a written response to the reason(s).

      (c) If so requested, an informal hearing shall be held within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request.

      (d) The appropriate official or body will render a written determination within seven calendar days after the informal hearing.

      (e) The employee has a right to request an administrative review by the ASE or AEPA of the determination within 10 calendar days of that determination. The ASE or AEPA then has 20 calendar days to render a final decision. Where the employee is the supervisor of the school or an agency education employee, any appeal of the ASE or AEPA would be addressed to the Director for a decision. If the Director or ASE's or AEPA's decision overturns the appropriate official or bodies determination, the appropriate official or body will be notified of the reasons in writing. Failure by the Director or ASE or AEPA to act within the 20 days will sustain the determination. This completes the administrative appeal process.

      (f) Failure of any of the parties to meet the requirements of the above procedures will serve to negate the particular action sought by the negligent party.

      (g) Those employees with less than three full continuous school terms of consecutive contract appointments are serving a probationary period. Nonrenewal of his/her contract will be considered a continuation of the examining process. This action cannot be appealed or grieved.

      (h) Independent of the procedures outlined in this section, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA, for applicable positions, shall be required to submit to the ASE or AEPA or appropriate higher authority all nonrenewal actions. Within 60 days, the ASE or AEPA shall review the nonrenewal actions and may overturn the determination of nonrenewal. In the event that the ASE or AEPA makes a decision to overturn the school board determination, the ASE or AEPA shall notify the school board in writing of his/her reasons for doing so.

      (i) No more than the substantial standard of evidence shall be required to sustain the nonrenewal.

      (j) A procedural error shall not be grounds for overturning a determination of nonrenewal unless the employee shows harmful error in the application of the Agency's procedures in arriving at such a decision. For purposes of this section, “harmful error” means error by the Agency in the application of its procedures which, in the absence or cure of the error, might have caused the Agency to reach a conclusion different than the one reached. The burden is upon the appellant to show that based upon the record as a whole, the error was harmful. i.e., caused substantial harm or prejudice to his/her rights.

      (k) Nonrenewal of a contract is not discharge and will not follow the discharge procedures.

      § 38.9   Discharge of educators.

#### § § 38.9

      (a)  Educators covered under the provision of this section are excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. 7511 and 4303. In order to provide due process for educators, the Director shall publish in 62 BIAM representative conditions that could result in the discharge of educators for cause and procedures to be followed in discharge cases.

      (b)  Action to remove educators for inadequate performance will be taken for failure to meet performance standards established under 5 U.S.C. 4302. Performance standards for all educators will include, among others, lack of student achievement. Willful failure to exercise properly assigned supervisory responsibilities by supervisors shall also be cause for discharge.

      (c)  The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM a description of the budgetary and programmatic conditions that may result in the discharge of educators for other than cause during the school term. The individual's personnel record will clearly reflect that the action taken is based upon budgetary or programmatic restraints and is not a reflection on the employee's performance.

      (d)  The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM the procedural steps to be followed by school supervisors, ASE's, and AEPA's in discharge for cause cases. These procedures shall provide (among other things) for the following:

      (1) The educator to be discharged shall receive a written notice of the proposal, specifying the causes or complaints upon which the proposal is based, not less than 30 calendar days before the discharge. However, this shall not prohibit the exclusion of the individual from the education facility in cases where exclusion is required for the safety of the students or the orderly operation of the facility.

      (2) A reasonable time, but not less than 10 calendar days, will be allotted for the individual to make written and/or oral responses to the charge.

      (3) An opportunity will be afforded the individual to review the material relied upon to support the charge.

      (4) Official time, not to exceed eight hours, will be provided to the individual to prepare a response to the charge.

      (5) The educator may elect to have a representative and shall furnish the identity of any representative to the ASE or AEPA. The ASE or AEPA may disallow, as an employee representative, any individual whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or when priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official duties. The terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) shall govern representation of employees in an exclusive bargaining unit.

      (6) The individual has a right to a final decision made by the appropriate level of supervision.

      (7) The individual has a right to appeal the final decision and have the merits of the case reviewed by a Departmental official not previously involved in the case. This right includes entitlement to a hearing upon request under procedures in accordance with the requirements of due process under section 1131(e)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 95-561.

      (e)  (1) The appropriate school board shall be notified as soon as possible, but in no case later than 10 calendar days from the date of issue of the notice of intent to discharge.

      (2) The appropriate school board, under any uniform procedure as it may adopt, may issue a formal written certification to the school supervisor, ASE, or AEPA either approving or disapproving the discharge before the expiration of the notice period and before actual discharge. Failure to respond before the expiration of the notice period will have the effect of approving the discharge.

      (3) The school supervisor initiating a discharge action may appeal the board's determination to the ASE or AEPA within 10 calendar days of receipt of the board's notice. The ASE or AEPA initiating a discharge may appeal the board's determination to the Director within 10 calendar days of receipt of the board's notice. Within 20 calendar days following the receipt of an appeal, the reviewing official may, for good cause, reverse the school board's determination by a notice in writing to the board. Failure to act within 20 calendar days shall have the effect of approving the board's determination.

      (f)  School boards may recommend in writing to school supervisors, ASE's, or AEPA's, and the Director that individuals in the education program be discharged. These written recommendations may follow any procedures formally established internally by the school board or tribal government. However, the written recommendations must contain specific causes or complaints that may be verified or established by investigation of factual situations. The official receiving a board recommendation for discharge of an individual shall acknowledge the recommendation in writing within 10 calendar days of receipt and proceed with a fact finding investigation. The official who finally disposes of the recommendation shall notify the school board of the disposition in writing within 60 calendar days of initiation of the fact finding investigation.

      § 38.10   Conditions of employment of educators.

#### § § 38.10

      (a)  School boards may not direct, control, or interrupt the day-to-day activities of BIA employees carrying out Bureau-operated education programs.

      (b)  Employee handbook and recruiting guides shall be developed by each local school or agency to provide specific information regarding:

      (1) The working and hiring conditions for various tribal jurisdictions and Bureau locations;

      (2) The need for all education personnel to adapt to local situations; and

      (3) The requirement of all education personnel to comply with and support duly adopted school board policies, including those relating to tribal culture or language.

      (c)  Employees will be notified 60 calendar days before the end of the school term of the intent to renew or not renew their contract. If an individual's contract is to be renewed, the individual must agree in writing to serve for the next school term. This agreement must be received within 14 calendar days of the date of the notice in order to complete the contract renewal. If this agreement is not received by the fourteenth day, the employee has voluntarily forfeited his or her right to continuing employment. If an individual agrees to serve for the next school term and fails to report for duty at the beginning of the next school term, the contract will be terminated and the individual's future appointment will be subject to the restriction in § 38.7(k) of this part.

      (d)  An employee accepting a renewal of a school term contract may be appointed to another Federal position during the school recess period without regard to the dual compensation regulations in 5 U.S.C. 5533.

      (e)  Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) procedures established under 29 CFR part 1613 are applicable to contract employees under this part. It is the policy of the BIA that all employees and applicants for employment shall be treated equally when considered for employment or benefits of employment, regardless of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or mental or physical health (handicap), within the parameters of Indian preference.

      (f)  The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM procedures for the rapid and equitable resolution of grievances. In locations and for positions covered by an exclusive bargaining agreement, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive avenue of redress for all matters within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure.

      (g)  The minimum number of times a supervisor shall meet with an employee to discuss performance and suggest improvements shall be once every three months for the educator's first year at a school or Agency, and twice annually thereafter during the school term.

      § 38.11   Length of the regular school term.

#### § § 38.11

      The length of the regular school term shall be at least 180 student instructional days, unless a waiver has been granted under the provisions of 25 CFR 36.61.

      § 38.12   Leave system for education personnel.

#### § § 38.12

      (a)  Employees on a full-time school-term contract are authorized the following types of leave:

      (1)  A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.

      (i) The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.

      (ii) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be taken only during the school term. No compensation for or carryover of unused leave is authorized.

      (2)  Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.

      (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of four hours each biweekly pay period in pay status during the term of the contract; and no precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized.

      (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of separation.

      (3)  School term employees may receive up to 136 hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. School vacations are scheduled on the annual school calendar during the instructional year and may not be scheduled before the first day of student instruction or after the last day of student instruction. School vacations are not a right of the employee and cannot be paid for or carried over if the employee is required to work during the school vacation time or if the program will not permit school term employees to take such vacation time.

      (b)  Employees who are on a full-time, year-long contract are authorized the following types of leave:

      (1)  Absence approved in advance by the supervisor for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of employment—120 hours; years 3-5 of employment—160 hours; 6 or more years—200 hours. The supervisor will determine when vacation leave may be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an employee on the day following his or her date of employment, provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks. An employee may carry into succeeding years up to 200 hours of vacation leave. Leave unused at the time of separation is forfeited.

      (2)  Sick leave accumulation and use is authorized on the same basis as for school term employees under § 38.12(a)(2) of this part.

      (c)  Employees who are on part-time year-long contracts exceeding 20 hours per week are authorized the following types of leave:

      (1)  Absence approved in advance by the supervisor for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of employment—64 hours; years 3-5 of employment—80 hours; 6 or more years—104 hours. The supervisor shall determine when vacation leave may be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an employee on the day following his or her date of employment provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks and may not be accumulated in excess of 104 hours from year to year. An employee may carry over up to 104 hours from one contract year to the next. Leave unused at the time of separation is forfeited.

      (2)  Sick leave is accumulated on the basis of three hours each biweekly pay period in pay status; no precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized. Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of separation.

      (d)  (1) Employees on a part-time work schedule in excess of 20 hours per week may receive a maximum of 102 hours of school vacation time; 20 hours of personal/emergency leave; and 63 hours of sick leave accrued at three hours per pay period for the first 21 pay periods of their contracts. Personal/emergency leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.

      (2) The part-time employee will request the use of this leave in writing in advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.

      (3) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be taken only during the school year. No compensation for or carryover of unused leave is authorized.

      (4)  Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.

      (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of three hours each biweekly pay period in pay status for the first 21 pay periods of their contract; no precredit or advance for sick leave is authorized.

      (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of separation.

      (5)  Part-time employees may receive up to 102 hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. Approval for the use of this time will be administratively determined by the school supervisor, ASE or AEPA, and this time may not be scheduled before the start of school or after the end of school.

      (i) All school vacation time for part-time employees will be approved at the convenience of the program and not as a right of the employee.

      (ii) Vacation time cannot be paid for or carried over for a part-time employee if the employee is required to work during the school vacation time or if the program will not permit part-time employees to take such vacation time.

      (e)  The following are considered accountable absences:

      (1)  If prescheduled and approved by the school supervisor, ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, an employee may be on leave without pay.

      (2)  Any absence is not prescheduled or approved in advance or excused by the supervisor is considered absence without leave.

      (3)  Employees are entitled to paid absence for jury or witness service and military duty as a member of the National Guard or Reserve under the same terms or conditions as outlined in sections 6322 and 6323 of title 5 U.S.C., and corresponding provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual, when the absence occurs during the regular contract period. Employees may be requested to schedule their military leave at times other than when school is in session.

      (4)  Administrative leave is an excused absence from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay or without charge to leave. This leave is not a substitute for other paid or unpaid leave categories. Administrative leave usually is authorized on an individual basis except when a school is closed or a group of employees are excused from work for a particular purpose. The school supervisor, ASE or AEPA will grant administrative leave. A school closing must be approved by the ASE or AEPA.

      (f) Educators serving with contracts with work weeks of 20 hours a week or less are not eligible for any type of paid leave.

      (g) For school term educators, no paid leave is earned nor may accumulated leave be used during any period of employment with the Bureau between school terms.

      (h) Employees issued contracts for intermittent work are not eligible for any type of paid leave.

      (i)  Annual leave credited to an employee's accrued leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract education position or appointment under this part will be carried over and made available to the employee. Sick leave credited to an employee's accrued sick leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract education position or appointment under this part shall be credited to the employee's sick leave account under the system in § 38.12(a)(2) and (b)(2).

      § 38.13   Status quo employees in education positions.

#### § § 38.13

      (a)  Individuals who were Bureau employees on October 31, 1979, with an appointment in either the competitive or excepted service without time limitation, and who are serving in an education position, shall be continued in their positions under the terms and conditions of that appointment with no change in their status or positions. Such employees are entitled to receive any changes in compensation attached to the position. Although such employees occupy “education positions” as defined in this part, the terms and conditions of their appointment, status, and entitlements are determined by competitive service regulations and procedures. Under applicable procedures, these employees are eligible for consideration for movement to other positions that are defined as “contract education” positions. Such movement shall change the terms and conditions of their appointment to the terms and conditions of employment established under this part.

      (b) If the tribe or school board waives the Indian preference law, the employee loses the early-out retirement eligibility under Pub. L. 96-135, “early-out for non-Indians,” if they are entitled to the early-out retirement. A memorandum for the record on BIA letterhead shall be signed by the employee and placed on the permanent side of his/her Official Personnel Folder, along with the tribal resolution, if the tribe/school board has waived the Indian preference law to employ the non-Indian.”

      (c)  Status quo employees may request in writing to the school supervisor, ASE or AEPA, as applicable, that their position be converted to contract. The appropriate school board will be consulted and a determination made by such school board whether such individual should be converted to a contract employee.

      (1) Written determination by the school board should be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days from receipt of the request. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of disapproving the proposed conversion.

      (2) With school board approval, an involuntary change in position shall not affect the current status of status quo education employees.

      § 38.14   Voluntary services.

#### § § 38.14

      (a)  An ASE or AEPA may, subject to the approval of the local school board concerned, accept voluntary services on behalf of Bureau schools from the private sector, including individuals, groups, or students. Voluntary service shall be for all non-hazardous activities where public services, special projects, or school operations are improved and enhanced. Volunteer service is limited to personal services received without compensation (salary or wages) by the Bureau from individuals, groups, and students. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require Federal employees to work without compensation or to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace Federal employees.

      (b)  An agreement is a written document, jointly completed by the volunteer, the Bureau school supervisor, and the school board, that outlines the responsibilities of each. In the case of students receiving credit for their work (i.e., student teaching) from an education institution, the agreement will be jointly completed by the student, a representative of the institution, and the Bureau school supervisor. In the case of volunteer groups, the agreement shall be signed by an official of the volunteering organization, the Bureau school supervisor, and the school board and a list of signatures and emergency telephone numbers of all participants shall be attached.

      (c)  Although no minimum age requirement exists for volunteers, schools shall comply with appropriate Federal and State laws and standards on using the services of minors. All volunteers under the age of 18 must obtain written permission from their parents or guardians to perform volunteer activities.

      (d)  Volunteers participating under this part are not considered Federal employees for any purpose other than:

      (1) Title 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, dealing with compensation for injuries sustained during the performance of work assignments.

      (2) Federal tort claims provisions published in 28 U.S.C. chapter 171.

      (3) Department of the Interior Regulations Governing Responsibilities and Conduct.

      (e)  The decision to reimburse travel and other incidental expenses, as well as the amount of reimbursement, shall be made by the school supervisor, ASE, AEPA, and the respective school board. Payment is made in the same manner as for regular employees. Payment of travel and per diem expenses to a volunteer on a particular assignment must be supported by a specific travel authorization and cannot exceed the cost of employing a temporary employee of comparable qualification at the school for which a travel authorization is considered.

      (f)  School supervisors shall submit reports on volunteers to the ASE or AEPA by October 31 of each year for the preceding year.

      § 38.15   Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute.

#### § § 38.15

      (a) The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute has an independent personnel system established under Public Law 105-337, the Administrative Systems Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3171. The details of this system are in the Indian Affairs Manual (IAM) at Part 20. This manual system may be found in Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional and Agency Offices, Education Line Offices, and the Central Office in Washington, DC.

      (b) The personnel system is in the excepted service and addresses the areas of classification, staffing, pay, performance, discipline, and separation. Other areas of personnel such as leave, retirement, life insurance, health benefits, thrift savings, etc., remain under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.

If a school transports students over unimproved roads, the school must separate the number of miles driven for each bus into improved miles and unimproved miles. The number of miles driven is the sum of:

          (1) The number of miles driven on improved roads; and

          (2) The number of miles driven on unimproved roads multiplied by 1.2.

          (c) The annual miles driven for each school is the sum of the mileage from paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section multiplied by 4.

      Subpart H—Determining the Amount Necessary To Sustain an Academic or Residential Program

**Source:** Source: 70 FR 22205, Apr. 28, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

        § 39.801   What is the formula to determine the amount necessary to sustain a school's academic or residential program?

#### § § 39.801

        (a) The Secretary's formula to determine the minimum annual amount necessary to sustain a Bureau-funded school's academic or residential program is as follows:

        (b) Sections 39.802 through 39.807 explain the derivation of the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) If the annual minimum amount calculated under this section and §§ 39.802 through 39.807 is not fully funded, OIEP will pro rate funds distributed to schools using the Indian School Equalization Formula.

        § 39.802   What is the student unit value in the formula?

#### § § 39.802

        The student unit value is the dollar value applied to each student in an academic or residential program. There are two types of student unit values: the student unit instructional value (SUIV) and the student unit residential value (SURV).

        (a) The student unit instructional value (SUIV) applies to a student enrolled in an instructional program. It is an annually established ratio of 1.0 that represents a student in grades 4 through 6 of a typical non-residential program.

        (b) The student unit residential value (SURV) applies to a residential student. It is an annually established ratio of 1.0 that represents a student in grades 4 through 6 of a typical residential program.

        § 39.803   What is a weighted student unit in the formula?

#### § § 39.803

        A weighted student unit is an adjusted ratio using factors in the Indian School Equalization Formula to establish educational priorities and to provide for the unique needs of specific students, such as:

        (a) Students in grades kindergarten through 3 or grades 7 through 12;

        (b) Special education students;

        (c) Gifted and talented students;

        (d) Distance education students;

        (e) Vocational and industrial education students;

        (f) Native Language Instruction students;

        (g) Small schools;

        (h) Personnel costs;

        (i) Alternative schooling; and

        (j) Early Childhood Education programs.

        § 39.804   How is the SUIV calculated?

#### § § 39.804

        The SUIV is calculated by the following 5-step process:

        (a)  Use the adjusted national average current expenditures (ANACE) of public and private schools determined by data from the U.S. Department of Education-National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) for the last school year for which data is available.

        (b)  Subtract the average specific Federal share per student (title I part A and IDEA part B) of the total revenue for Bureau-funded elementary and secondary schools for the last school year for which data is available as reported by NCES (15%).

        (c)  Subtract the administrative cost grant/agency area technical services revenue per student as a percentage of the total revenue (current expenditures) of Bureau-funded schools from the last year data is available.

        (d)  Subtract the day transportation revenue per student as a percentage of the total revenue (current revenue) Bureau-funded schools for the last school year for which data is available.

        (e)  Add Johnson O'Malley funding. (See the table, in § 39.805)

        § 39.805   What was the student unit for instruction value (SUIV) for the school year 1999-2000?

#### § § 39.805

        The process described in § 39.804 is illustrated in the table below, using figures for the 1999-2000 school year:

        § 39.806   How is the SURV calculated?

#### § § 39.806

        (a) The SURV is the adjusted national average current expenditures for residential schools (ANACER) of public and private residential schools. This average is determined using data from the Association of Boarding Schools.

        (b) Applying the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the SURV for school year 1999-2000 was $11,000.

        § 39.807   How will the Student Unit Value be adjusted annually?

#### § § 39.807

        (a) The student unit instructional value (SUIV) and the student unit residential value (SURV) will be adjusted annually to derive the current year Student Unit Value (SUV) by dividing the calculated SUIV and the SURV into two parts and adjusting each one as shown in this section.

        (1) The first part consists of 85 percent of the calculated SUIV and the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the personnel cost of living increase of the Department of Defense schools for each year.

        (2) The second part consists of 15 percent the calculated SUIV and the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the Consumer Price Index-Urban of the Department of Labor.

        (b) If the student unit value amount is not fully funded, the schools will receive their pro rata share using the Indian School Equalization Formula.

        § 39.808   What definitions apply to this subpart?

#### § § 39.808

        means the actual current expenditures for pupils in fall enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools for the last school year for which data is available. These expenditures are adjusted annually to reflect current year expenditures of federally financed schools' cost of day and residential programs.

        means expenses related to classroom instruction, classroom supplies, administration, support services-students and other support services and operations. _Current expenditures_ do not include facility operations and maintenance, buildings and improvements, furniture, equipment, vehicles, student activities and debt retirement.

        § 39.809   Information collection.

#### § § 39.809

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 ) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This part involves collections of information subject to the PRA in §§ 39.410 and 39.502. These collections have been approved by OMB under control numbers 1076-0122, 1076-0134, and 1076-0163.

        § 41.5   How is ISC/FTE calculated?

#### § § 41.5

        (a) ISC is calculated on the basis of eligible registrations of Indian students as of the conclusion of the third week of each academic term.

        (b) To calculate ISC for an academic term, begin by adding all credit hours of full-time Indian students and all credit hours of part-time Indian students, including full-time and part-time distance education Indian students, who are registered at the conclusion of the third week of the academic term.

        (c) Credit hours earned by Indian students who have not obtained a high school degree or its equivalent may be added if you have established criteria for the admission of such students on the basis of their ability to benefit from the education or training offered. You will be presumed to have established such criteria if your admission procedures include counseling or testing that measures students' aptitude to successfully complete the courses in which they enroll.

        (d) No credit hours earned by an Indian student attending high school and applied towards the student's high school degree or its equivalent may be counted toward computation of ISC; and no credit hours earned by an Indian student not making satisfactory progress toward a degree or certificate may count toward the ISC.

        (e) If ISC is being calculated for a fall term, add to the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section any credits earned in classes offered during the preceding summer term.

        (f) Add to the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section those credits being earned in an eligible continuing education program at the conclusion of the third week of the academic term. Determine the number of those credits as follows:

        (1) For institutions on a semester system: One credit for every 15 contact hours and

        (2) For institutions on a quarter system: One credit for every 10 contact hours of participation in an organized continuing education experience under responsible sponsorship, capable direction, and qualified instruction, as described in the criteria established by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training. Limit the number of calculated eligible continuing education credits to 10 percent of your ISC.

        (g) Divide by 12 the final calculation in paragraph (f) of this section. The formula for the full calculation is expressed mathematically as:

        (h) In the formula in paragraph (g) of this section, the abbreviations used have the following meanings:

        (1) FTCR = the number of credit hours carried by full-time Indian students (students carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of the third week of each academic term); and

        (2) PTCR = the number of credit hours carried by part-time Indian students (students carrying fewer than 12 credit hours at the end of the third week of each academic term).

        (3) SCR = in a fall term, the number of credit hours earned during the preceding summer term.

        (4) CECR = the number of credit hours being earned in an eligible continuing education program at the conclusion of the third week of the academic term, in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

        (ii) The notification must be sent to the tribe (and spokesperson, for petitions) promptly but in no case less than 30 days before calling the election.

        § 81.8   What happens if a governing Federal statute and this part disagree?

#### § § 81.8

        If a conflict appears to exist between this part and a specific requirement of the Federal statute, this part must be interpreted to conform to the statute.

        § 81.9   Will the Secretary give deference to the Tribe's interpretation of its own documents?

#### § § 81.9

        The Secretary will give deference to the tribe's reasonable interpretation of the amendment and adoption articles of the tribe's governing documents. The Secretary retains authority, however, to interpret tribal law when necessary to carry out the government-to-government relationship with the tribe or when a provision, result, or interpretation may be contrary to Federal law.

        § 81.10   Who may cast a vote in a Secretarial election?

#### § § 81.10

        § 81.11   May a tribe establish a voting age different from 18 years of age for Secretarial elections?

#### § § 81.11

        No. A Secretarial election is a Federal election. According to the 26th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, adopted July 1, 1971, all individuals 18 years of age and older must be allowed to vote in Federal elections.

        § 81.12   What type of electioneering is allowed before and during Secretarial election?

#### § § 81.12

        There shall be no electioneering within 50 feet of the entrance of a polling site.

        § 81.13   What types of voting assistance are provided for a Secretarial election?

#### § § 81.13

        If polling sites are required by the amendment or adoption article of the tribe's governing document, the Chair of the Secretarial Election Board will:

        (a) Appoint interpreters;

        (b) Ensure that audio or visual aids for the hearing or visually impaired are provided;

        (c) Ensure that reasonable accommodations are made for others with impairments that would impede their ability to vote; and

        (d) Allow the interpreter or Secretarial Election Board member to explain the election process and voting instructions. At the request of the voter, the interpreter or Board member may accompany the voter into the voting booth, but must not influence the voter in casting the ballot.

        § 81.14   May Secretarial elections be scheduled at the same time as tribal elections?

#### § § 81.14

        The Secretarial Election Board will, generally, avoid scheduling Secretarial elections at the same time as tribal elections to avoid confusion. If the Secretarial Election Board decides to schedule a Secretarial election at the same time as a tribal election, the Secretarial Election Board must clearly inform eligible voters of any differences between the tribal election and the Secretarial election and separate ballots must be used for each type of election.

        § 81.15   How are conflicting proposals to amend a single document handled?

#### § § 81.15

        When conflicting proposals to amend a single provision of a tribal governing document or charter provision are submitted, the proposal first received by the Local Bureau Official, if properly submitted as a complete tribal request, must be voted on before any consideration is given other proposals. Other proposals must be considered in order of their receipt if they are resubmitted following final agency action on the first submission. This procedure applies regardless of whether the proposal is a new or revised tribal governing document.

        § 81.16   Who pays for holding the Secretarial election?

#### § § 81.16

        (a) A Secretarial election is a Federal election; therefore, Federal funding will be used to cover costs. The Bureau will pay for the costs, unless the tribe has received funding for this function through contracts or self-governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450f,

        (b) Once a tribe removes the requirement for Secretarial approval, all subsequent elections it holds to amend the governing document are tribal elections and the tribe is responsible for the costs of those elections.

        § 81.17   May a tribe use its funds to pay non-Federal election officials?

#### § § 81.17

        A recognized tribal governing body may use tribal funds to compensate non-Federal personnel to respond to the needs of the tribal government in the conduct of the Secretarial election.

        § 81.18   Who can withdraw a request for a Secretarial election?

#### § § 81.18

        The tribe may withdraw the request for Secretarial election in the same manner in which the Secretarial election was requested. The petitioners may withdraw the request for Secretarial election by submitting a new petition, with signatures of at least a majority of the signers of the original petition, seeking withdrawal of the original petition. However, the request for a Secretarial election cannot be withdrawn after the established deadline for voter registration.

        § 81.29   Why does the Secretarial Election Board compile a Registered Voters List?

#### § § 81.29

        The Registered Voters List is a list of eligible voters who have registered and are, therefore, entitled to vote in the Secretarial election. We use this list, after all challenges have been resolved, to determine whether voter participation in the Secretarial election satisfies the minimum requirements of the tribe's governing documents and Federal law.

        § 81.30   What information is contained in the Registered Voters List?

#### § § 81.30

        The Registered Voters List must contain the names, in alphabetical order, of all registered voters and their voting districts, if voting districts are required by the tribe's governing document's amendment or adoption articles.

        § 81.34   How are the official ballots prepared?

#### § § 81.34

        (b) The following information must appear on the face of the mailout or absentee ballot:

        (c) When polling places are required by the tribe's governing document, the official ballot may be a paper ballot, voting machine ballot, or other type of ballot supporting the secret ballot process.

        § 81.35   When must the Secretarial Election Board send ballots to voters?

#### § § 81.35

        (a) Unless the amendment or adoption articles of the tribe's governing document require the use of polling sites in the election, the election must be conducted entirely by mailout ballots, and the Secretarial Election Board must send mailout ballots to registered voters promptly upon completion of the Registered Voters List.

        (b) When the amendment or adoption articles of the tribe's governing document require the use of polling sites in the election, the Secretarial Election Board must send an absentee ballot to every registered voter who requests an absentee ballot, as long as the request is received before the Secretarial election date.

        (c) All mailout or absentee ballot deliveries must be via U.S. Mail or by hand-delivery to the location identified in the Secretarial election notice before the date of the Secretarial election.

        § 81.36   What will the mailout or absentee ballot packet include?

#### § § 81.36

        The mailout or absentee ballot packet contains:

        § 81.37   How do I cast my vote at a polling site?

#### § § 81.37

        If polling sites are required by the tribe's governing document's amendment or adoption articles, the Secretarial Election Board will establish procedures for how polling site ballots will be presented and collected, including, but not limited to, paper ballots, voting machines, or other methods supporting a secret ballot.

        § 81.38   When are ballots counted?

#### § § 81.38

        The ballots will be counted under the supervision of the Secretarial Election Board, after the deadline established for receiving all ballots or closing of the polls, if polling sites are required by the tribe's governing document's amendment or adoption articles.

        § 81.39   How does the Board determine whether the required percentage of registered voters have cast ballots?

#### § § 81.39

        The Secretarial Election Board must count the number of valid ballots and cast spoiled ballots to determine total voter participation. The Board must take the total voter participation and divide it by the total number of Registered Voters. This total is used to determine whether the percentage of Registered Voters who cast votes meets the requirements of the tribe's governing documents or Federal statute that requires at least 30 percent voter participation. For example:

        (a) If there were 200 registered voters of which 75 cast valid ballots and 5 cast spoiled ballots for a total of 80 cast ballots (75 + 5 = 80). The percentage of voter participation would be determined as follows:

        Total number of votes cast (80) divided by the total number registered voters (200) or 80 ÷ 200 = 0.40 or 40 percent voter participation.

        (b) This example meets the Federal statutory requirement of at least 30 percent voter participation.

        § 81.40   What happens if a ballot is spoiled before it is cast?

#### § § 81.40

        If a ballot is spoiled before it is cast, this section applies.

        (a) The registered voter may return the spoiled ballot to the Secretarial Election Board by mail or in person at the local Bureau office with a request for a new ballot before the election date. The new ballot will be promptly provided to the registered voter. The Secretarial Election Board must retain all “spoiled uncast ballots” for recordkeeping purposes.

        (b) If polling sites are required, the voter may return the spoiled ballot to the polling site worker and request a new ballot. Upon receiving the new ballot, the voter must then complete the voting process. The polling site worker will mark the spoiled ballot “spoiled uncast” and record that the ballot has been spoiled. The polling site worker must retain all “spoiled uncast ballots” for recordkeeping purposes.

        § 81.41   Who certifies the results of the Election?

#### § § 81.41

        The Chair and all members of the Secretarial Election Board must be present during the counting of the ballots and must sign the Certificate of Results of Election.

        (1) Forward the original text of the document, Original Certificate of Approval or Disapproval, and the Certificate of Results of Election to the tribe and a copy of all documents to the Bureau Director; and

        (2) Retain, as required by the Records Disposition Schedule, a copy of all document(s) relevant to the Secretarial election.

        (b) A splinter group, political faction, community, or entity of any character that separates from the main body of a currently federally recognized Indian tribe, petitioner, or previous petitioner unless the entity can clearly demonstrate it has functioned from 1900 until the present as a politically autonomous community and meets § 83.11(f), even though some have regarded them as part of or associated in some manner with a federally recognized Indian tribe;

        (c) An entity that is, or an entity whose members are, subject to congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the government-to-government relationship; or

The list may be published more frequently, if the Assistant Secretary deems it necessary.

        (b) OFA will maintain guidelines limited to general suggestions on how and where to conduct research. The guidelines may be supplemented or updated as necessary. OFA will also make available examples of portions of documented petitions in the preferred format, though OFA will accept other formats.

        (c) OFA will, upon request, give prospective petitioners suggestions and advice on how to prepare the documented petition. OFA will not be responsible for the actual research on behalf of the petitioner.

        § 83.7   How does this part apply to documented petitions submitted before August 17, 2015?

Response is required to obtain a benefit. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the form or regulation requesting the information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. Send comments regarding this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer—Indian Affairs, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240.

      Subpart B—Criteria for Federal Acknowledgment

        § 83.10   How will the Department evaluate each of the criteria?

#### § § 83.10

        (a) The Department will consider a criterion in § 83.11 to be met if the available evidence establishes a reasonable likelihood of the validity of the facts relating to that criterion.

        (1) The Department will not require conclusive proof of the facts relating to a criterion in order to consider the criterion met.

        (2) The Department will require existence of community and political influence or authority be demonstrated on a substantially continuous basis, but this demonstration does not require meeting these criteria at every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during various years will not in themselves be a cause for denial of acknowledgment under these criteria.

        (3) The petitioner may use the same evidence to establish more than one criterion.

        (4) Evidence or methodology that the Department found sufficient to satisfy any particular criterion in a previous decision will be sufficient to satisfy the criterion for a present petitioner.

        (b) When evaluating a petition, the Department will:

        (1) Allow criteria to be met by any suitable evidence, rather than requiring the specific forms of evidence stated in the criteria;

        (2) Take into account historical situations and time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited or not available;

        (3) Take into account the limitations inherent in demonstrating historical existence of community and political influence or authority;

        (4) Require a demonstration that the criteria are met on a substantially continuous basis, meaning without substantial interruption; and

        (5) Apply these criteria in context with the history, regional differences, culture, and social organization of the petitioner.

        § 83.11   What are the criteria for acknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe?

#### § § 83.11

        The criteria for acknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe are delineated in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

        (a)  The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. Evidence that the group's character as an Indian entity has from time to time been denied will not be considered to be conclusive evidence that this criterion has not been met. Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's Indian identity may include one or a combination of the following, as well as other evidence of identification.

        (1) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal authorities.

        (2) Relationships with State governments based on identification of the group as Indian.

        (3) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local government in a relationship based on the group's Indian identity.

        (4) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists, historians, and/or other scholars.

        (5) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and books.

        (6) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships with Indian tribes or with national, regional, or state Indian organizations.

        (7) Identification as an Indian entity by the petitioner itself.

        (b)  The petitioner comprises a distinct community and demonstrates that it existed as a community from 1900 until the present. Distinct community means an entity with consistent interactions and significant social relationships within its membership and whose members are differentiated from and distinct from nonmembers. Distinct community must be understood flexibly in the context of the history, geography, culture, and social organization of the entity. The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion by providing evidence for known adult members or by providing evidence of relationships of a reliable, statistically significant sample of known adult members.

        (1) The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion at a given point in time by some combination of two or more of the following forms of evidence or by other evidence to show that a significant and meaningful portion of the petitioner's members constituted a distinct community at a given point in time:

        (i) Rates or patterns of known marriages within the entity, or, as may be culturally required, known patterned out-marriages;

        (ii) Social relationships connecting individual members;

        (iii) Rates or patterns of informal social interaction that exist broadly among the members of the entity;

        (iv) Shared or cooperative labor or other economic activity among members;

        (v) Strong patterns of discrimination or other social distinctions by non-members;

        (vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity;

        (vii) Cultural patterns shared among a portion of the entity that are different from those of the non-Indian populations with whom it interacts. These patterns must function as more than a symbolic identification of the group as Indian. They may include, but are not limited to, language, kinship organization or system, religious beliefs or practices, and ceremonies;

        (viii) The persistence of a collective identity continuously over a period of more than 50 years, notwithstanding any absence of or changes in name;

        (ix) Land set aside by a State for the petitioner, or collective ancestors of the petitioner, that was actively used by the community for that time period;

        (x) Children of members from a geographic area were placed in Indian boarding schools or other Indian educational institutions, to the extent that supporting evidence documents the community claimed; or

        (xi) A demonstration of political influence under the criterion in § 83.11(c)(1) will be evidence for demonstrating distinct community for that same time period.

        (2) The petitioner will be considered to have provided more than sufficient evidence to demonstrate distinct community and political authority under § 83.11(c) at a given point in time if the evidence demonstrates any one of the following:

        (i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a geographical area exclusively or almost exclusively composed of members of the entity, and the balance of the entity maintains consistent interaction with some members residing in that area;

        (ii) At least 50 percent of the members of the entity were married to other members of the entity;

        (iii) At least 50 percent of the entity members maintain distinct cultural patterns such as, but not limited to, language, kinship system, religious beliefs and practices, or ceremonies;

        (iv) There are distinct community social institutions encompassing at least 50 percent of the members, such as kinship organizations, formal or informal economic cooperation, or religious organizations; or

        (v) The petitioner has met the criterion in § 83.11(c) using evidence described in § 83.11(c)(2).

        (c)  The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from 1900 until the present. Political influence or authority means the entity uses a council, leadership, internal process, or other mechanism as a means of influencing or controlling the behavior of its members in significant respects, making decisions for the entity which substantially affect its members, and/or representing the entity in dealing with outsiders in matters of consequence. This process is to be understood flexibly in the context of the history, culture, and social organization of the entity.

        (1) The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion by some combination of two or more of the following forms of evidence or by other evidence that the petitioner had political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity:

        (i) The entity is able to mobilize significant numbers of members and significant resources from its members for entity purposes.

        (ii) Many of the membership consider issues acted upon or actions taken by entity leaders or governing bodies to be of importance.

        (iii) There is widespread knowledge, communication, or involvement in political processes by many of the entity's members.

        (iv) The entity meets the criterion in § 83.11(b) at greater than or equal to the percentages set forth under § 83.11(b)(2).

        (v) There are internal conflicts that show controversy over valued entity goals, properties, policies, processes, or decisions.

        (vi) The government of a federally recognized Indian tribe has a significant relationship with the leaders or the governing body of the petitioner.

        (vii) Land set aside by a State for petitioner, or collective ancestors of the petitioner, that is actively used for that time period.

        (viii) There is a continuous line of entity leaders and a means of selection or acquiescence by a significant number of the entity's members.

        (2) The petitioner will be considered to have provided sufficient evidence of political influence or authority at a given point in time if the evidence demonstrates any one of the following:

        (i) Entity leaders or other internal mechanisms exist or existed that:

        (A) Allocate entity resources such as land, residence rights, and the like on a consistent basis;

        (B) Settle disputes between members or subgroups by mediation or other means on a regular basis;

        (C) Exert strong influence on the behavior of individual members, such as the establishment or maintenance of norms or the enforcement of sanctions to direct or control behavior; or

        (D) Organize or influence economic subsistence activities among the members, including shared or cooperative labor.

        (ii) The petitioner has met the requirements in § 83.11(b)(2) at a given time.

        (d)  The petitioner must provide:

        (1) A copy of the entity's present governing document, including its membership criteria; or

        (2) In the absence of a governing document, a written statement describing in full its membership criteria and current governing procedures.

        (e)  The petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe (or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity).

        (1) The petitioner satisfies this criterion by demonstrating that the petitioner's members descend from a tribal roll directed by Congress or prepared by the Secretary on a descendancy basis for purposes of distributing claims money, providing allotments, providing a tribal census, or other purposes, unless significant countervailing evidence establishes that the tribal roll is substantively inaccurate; or

        (2) If no tribal roll was directed by Congress or prepared by the Secretary, the petitioner satisfies this criterion by demonstrating descent from a historical Indian tribe (or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity) with sufficient evidence including, but not limited to, one or a combination of the following identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being descendants of a historical Indian tribe (or of historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity):

        (i) Federal, State, or other official records or evidence;

        (ii) Church, school, or other similar enrollment records;

        (iii) Records created by historians and anthropologists in historical times;

        (iv) Affidavits of recognition by tribal elders, leaders, or the tribal governing body with personal knowledge; and

        (v) Other records or evidence.

        (f)  The petitioner's membership is composed principally of persons who are not members of any federally recognized Indian tribe. However, a petitioner may be acknowledged even if its membership is composed principally of persons whose names have appeared on rolls of, or who have been otherwise associated with, a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the petitioner demonstrates that:

        (1) It has functioned as a separate politically autonomous community by satisfying criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; and

        (2) Its members have provided written confirmation of their membership in the petitioner.

        (g)  Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of congressional legislation that has expressly terminated or forbidden the Federal relationship. The Department must determine whether the petitioner meets this criterion, and the petitioner is not required to submit evidence to meet it.

        § 83.12   What are the criteria for a previously federally acknowledged petitioner?

#### § § 83.12

        (a) The petitioner may prove it was previously acknowledged as a federally recognized Indian tribe, or is a portion that evolved out of a previously federally recognized Indian tribe, by providing substantial evidence of unambiguous Federal acknowledgment, meaning that the United States Government recognized the petitioner as an Indian tribe eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians with which the United States carried on a relationship at some prior date including, but not limited to, evidence that the petitioner had:

        (1) Treaty relations with the United States;

        (2) Been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive Order;

        (3) Been treated by the Federal Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds; or

        (4) Land held for it or its collective ancestors by the United States.

        (b) Once the petitioner establishes that it was previously acknowledged, it must demonstrate that it meets:

        (1) At present, the Community Criterion; and

        (2) Since the time of previous Federal acknowledgment or 1900, whichever is later, the Indian Entity Identification Criterion and Political Authority Criterion.

#### § § 83.23

          (a) OFA will begin reviews of documented petitions in the order of their receipt.

          (1) At each successive review stage, there may be points at which OFA is waiting on additional information or clarification from the petitioner. Upon receipt of the additional information or clarification, OFA will return to its review of the documented petition as soon as possible.

          (2) To the extent possible, OFA will give highest priority to completing reviews of documented petitions it has already begun to review.

          (b) OFA will maintain a numbered register of documented petitions that have been received.

          (c) OFA will maintain a numbered register of any letters of intent, which were allowable prior to July 31, 2015, or incomplete ( not fully documented) petitions and the original dates of their filing with the Department. If two or more documented petitions are ready for review on the same date, this register will determine the order of consideration.

          § 83.24   What opportunity will the petitioner have to respond to comments before OFA reviews the petition?

#### § § 83.24

          Before beginning review of a documented petition, OFA will provide the petitioner with any comments on the petition received from individuals or entities under § 83.22(b) and provide the petitioner with 90 days to respond to such comments. OFA will not begin review until it receives the petitioner's response to the comments or the petitioner requests that OFA proceed without its response.

          § 83.25   Who will OFA notify when it begins review of a documented petition?

#### § § 83.25

          (b) The names of the researchers conducting the evaluation of the petition; and

          (c) The name of their supervisor.

          § 83.26   How will OFA review a documented petition?

#### § § 83.26

          (a)  When reviewing a documented petition, OFA will first determine if the petitioner meets the Governing Document Criterion (§ 83.11(d)), Descent Criterion (§ 83.11(e)), Unique Membership Criterion (§ 83.11(f)), and Termination Criterion (§ 83.11(g)), in accordance with the following steps.

          (1)(i) OFA will conduct a Phase I technical assistance review and notify the petitioner by letter of any deficiencies that would prevent the petitioner from meeting the Governing Document, Descent, Unique Membership, or Termination Criteria. Upon receipt of the letter, the petitioner must submit a written response that:

          (A) Withdraws the documented petition to further prepare the petition;

          (B) Submits additional information and/or clarification; or

          (C) Asks OFA to proceed with the review.

          (ii) If the documented petition claims previous Federal acknowledgment and/or includes evidence of previous Federal acknowledgment, the Phase I technical assistance review will include a review to determine whether that evidence meets the requirements of previous Federal acknowledgment (§ 83.12).

          (2) Following the receipt of the petitioner's written response to the Phase I technical assistance review, OFA will provide the petitioner with:

          (i) Any comments and evidence OFA may consider that the petitioner does not already have, to the extent allowable by Federal law; and

          (ii) The opportunity to respond in writing to the comments and evidence provided.

          (3) OFA will publish a negative proposed finding if it issues a deficiency letter under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and the petitioner:

          (i) Does not withdraw the documented petition or does not respond with information or clarification sufficient to address the deficiencies; or

          (ii) Asks OFA in writing to proceed with the review.

          (4) OFA will publish a positive proposed finding and proceed to Phase II if it determines that the petitioner meets the Governing Document, Descent, Unique Membership, and Termination criteria.

          (b)  If the petitioner meets the Governing Document, Descent, Unique Membership, and Termination criteria, OFA will next review whether the petitioner meets the Indian Entity Identification Criterion (§ 83.11(a)), the Community Criterion (§ 83.11(b)), and the Political Influence/Authority Criterion (§ 83.11(c)). If the petitioner claims previous Federal acknowledgment, the Department will also review whether petitioner proves previous Federal acknowledgment and, if so, will review whether the petitioner meets the criteria under § 83.12(b).

          (1) OFA will conduct a Phase II technical assistance review and notify the petitioner by letter of any deficiencies that would prevent the petitioner from meeting these criteria. Upon receipt of the letter, the petitioner must submit a written response that:

          (i) Withdraws the documented petition to further prepare the petition;

          (ii) Provides additional information and/or clarification; or

          (iii) Asks OFA to proceed with the review.

          (2) Following receipt of the petitioner's written response to the Phase II technical assistance review, OFA will provide the petitioner with:

          (i) Any comments and evidence OFA may consider in preparing the proposed finding that the petitioner does not already have, to the extent allowable by Federal law; and

          (ii) The opportunity to respond in writing to the comments and evidence provided.

          (3) OFA will then review the record to determine:

          (i) For petitioners with previous Federal acknowledgment, whether the criteria at § 83.12(b) are met; or

          (ii) For petitioners without previous Federal acknowledgment, whether the Indian Entity Identification (§ 83.11(a)), Community (§ 83.11(b)) and Political Authority (§ 83.11(c)) Criteria are met.

          (4) OFA will publish a negative proposed finding if it issues a deficiency letter under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the petitioner:

          (i) Does not withdraw the documented petition or does not respond with information or clarification sufficient to address the deficiencies; or

          (ii) Asks OFA in writing to proceed with the review.

          (5) OFA will publish a positive proposed finding if it determines that the petitioner meets the Indian Entity Identification (§ 83.11(a)), Community (§ 83.11(b)) and Political Authority (§ 83.11(c)) Criteria or, for petitioners with previous Federal acknowledgment, that the petitioner meets the criteria at § 83.12(b).

          § 83.27   What are technical assistance reviews?

#### § § 83.27

          Technical assistance reviews are preliminary reviews for OFA to tell the petitioner where there appear to be evidentiary gaps for the criteria that will be under review in that phase and to provide the petitioner with an opportunity to supplement or revise the documented petition.

          § 83.28   When does OFA review for previous Federal acknowledgment?

#### § § 83.28

          (a) OFA reviews the documented petition for previous Federal acknowledgment during the Phase II technical assistance review of the documented petition.

          (b) If OFA cannot verify previous Federal acknowledgment during this technical assistance review, the petitioner must provide additional evidence. If a petitioner claiming previous Federal acknowledgment does not respond or does not demonstrate the claim of previous Federal acknowledgment, OFA will consider its documented petition on the same basis as documented petitions submitted by petitioners not claiming previous Federal acknowledgment.

          § 83.29   What will OFA consider in its reviews?

#### § § 83.29

          (a) In any review, OFA will consider the documented petition and evidence submitted by the petitioner, any comments and evidence on the petition received during the comment period, and petitioners' responses to comments and evidence received during the response period.

          (b) OFA may also:

          (1) Initiate and consider other research for any purpose relative to analyzing the documented petition and obtaining additional information about the petitioner's status; and

          (2) Request and consider timely submitted additional explanations and information from commenting parties to support or supplement their comments on the proposed finding and from the petitioner to support or supplement their responses to comments.

          (c) OFA must provide the petitioner with the additional material obtained in paragraph (b) of this section, and provide the petitioner with the opportunity to respond to the additional material. The additional material and any response by the petitioner will become part of the record.

          § 83.30   Can a petitioner withdraw its documented petition?

#### § § 83.30

          § 83.31   Can OFA suspend review of a documented petition?

#### § § 83.31

          (a) OFA can suspend review of a documented petition, either conditionally or for a stated period, upon:

          (1) A showing to the petitioner that there are technical or administrative problems that temporarily preclude continuing review; and

          (2) Approval by the Assistant Secretary.

          (b) Upon resolution of the technical or administrative problems that led to the suspension, the documented petition will have the same priority on the numbered register of documented petitions to the extent possible.

          (1) OFA will notify the petitioner and those listed in § 83.22(d) when it suspends and when it resumes review of the documented petition.

          (2) Upon the resumption of review, OFA will have the full six months to issue a proposed finding.

      Payment of Tribal Attorney Fees With Appropriated Funds

**Source:** Source: 48 FR 3969, Jan. 28, 1983, unless otherwise noted.

        § 89.40   General policy.

#### § § 89.40

        In ordinary circumstances, legal services with respect to trust resources are provided for Indian tribe(s):

        (a) By private counsel employed by tribes when such tribe is financially able and elects to do so, or

        (b) By the United States as trustee through the Office of the Solicitor and/or the Department of Justice.

        § 89.41   Exceptions to policy.

#### § § 89.41

        The Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs upon concurrence of the Solicitor and receipt of a recommendation as provided by § 89.43 may, in his/her discretion, authorize the direct or indirect expenditure of appropriated funds to pay reasonable attorney's fees in order to permit an Indian tribe to secure private legal representation in the following circumstances:

        (a) When a tribe determines it necessary to bring a court action or to defend itself to protect its trust resources, rights claimed under a treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, or its governmental powers and the Attorney General refuses assistance or advises that assistance is not otherwise available (Comptroller General's Opinion B-114868, December 6, 1976).

        (b) When a tribe determines it necessary to institute or to defend itself in an administrative proceeding to protect its trust resources, rights claimed under a treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, or to protect its governmental powers and the Solicitor is unable to provide representation due to a conflict of interest or other reasons.

        (c) When a tribe determines legal assistance necessary, other than for litigation, pursuant to a contract executed under Pub. L. 93-638 and the Solicitor has determined that the services of his office are not available.

        (d) When a tribe determines it critical, and the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs finds the concerns of the tribe to have merit after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor, to intervene, in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department or in an administrative proceeding being handled by the Solicitor because the responsible Government Attorney refuses either to exclude or to include some facet of the suit or proceedings which the tribe claims renders such legal representation completely inadequate to protect or in contravention of the rights and interests of the tribe. Prior to consulting with and advising the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs, in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department, the Solicitor shall seek the comments and advice of the Attorney General.

        (e) When a tribe determines, and the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs, after consultation with the Solicitor concurs, that a substantial possibility of a negotiated settlement or agreement exists.

        (f) Payment of fees will not be allowed if such payment was not authorized before services were performed.

        (g) This rule applies to expenditure of appropriated Federal funds and not a tribe's own funds on deposit in the U.S. Treasury.

        § 89.42   Factors to be considered.

#### § § 89.42

        The following factors are to be considered in determining whether funds should be paid to provide private legal representation for a tribe.

        (a) The merits of the legal position which the tribe asserts. Greater weight will be given to those cases where the tribe's legal argument is deemed particularly meritorious than to those cases where the tribe's position, although not entirely without merit, may be relatively weak;

        (b) The ability of the tribe to pay all or a part of its legal expenses out of its own funds. A review of the tribe's financial resources under this subsection will include an examination of the tribe's total expenditures to determine whether its expenditures for other purposes comport with the asserted importance of the case for which it seeks funds;

        (c) Whether the question the tribe seeks to litigate is being litigated in another case by another tribe;

        (d) Whether, as a matter of strategy, the issues the tribe seeks to litigate could be more satisfactorily resolved in another forum, in a different factual context, or a different time; and

        (e) Whether the issue should be litigated at all in preference to a legislative or other solution.

        § 89.43   Procedures.

#### § § 89.43

        The information collection requirements contained in this section do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3051  because it is anticipated there will be fewer than 10 respondents annually.

        (a) A tribe or other organization seeking funds under § 89.41 shall submit a written request through the Agency Superintendent and the Area Director, including

        (1) A detailed statement describing the nature and scope of the problems for which legal services are sought;

        (2) A statement of the terms, including total anticipated costs, of the requested legal services contract;

        (3) A current financial statement and a statement that the tribe does not possess sufficient tribal funds or assets to pay for all or a part of the legal services sought; and

        (4) A statement of why the matter must be handled by a private attorney as opposed to Department of Justice or Department of Interior attorneys.

        (b) If two of the three committee members recommend approval of a tribe's request, the request, along with the committee's recommendation, shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for final determination after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor. The committee's recommendation shall indicate the amount of funds recommended to assist the tribe, the hourly rate allowed, the maximum amount permitted to be expended in the recommended action and the tribal contributions, if any. The Assistant Secretary shall approve the request only with the concurrence of the Solicitor.

        (c) The requirements imposed by this policy are supplementary to those contained in all existing regulations dealing with attorney contracts with Indian tribes and, in particular, those contained in parts 88 and 89 of this title.

Loans made by tribes or relending organizations may be for the following purposes:

      (2) To individual Indians or Natives for purposes of purchasing, constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by the borrower.

      (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.

      (4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds and/or training are not available from grant or scholarship sources, or federal or state training programs.

      (b) Direct loans may be made by the United States to eligible tribes, tribal organizations or corporations and tribal cooperative associations without fund restrictions. Direct loans to individual Indians, partnerships, and other non-tribal organizations shall not exceed $350,000. Direct loans from the United States shall be made for the following purposes:

      (2) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of purchasing, constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by the borrower.

      (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.

      (c) Before a United States direct loan is approved, the Commissioner may require the applicants to prepare a market and capacity report on existing or proposed economic enterprises for which financing is requested if the operation involves manufacturing, selling or providing services.

      (d) Loans may be made to eligible tribes and Indian organizations for use in attracting industries and economic enterprises, the operation of which will contribute to the economy of a reservation. Tribes and Indian organizations may receive loans from the revolving loan fund for investment in or lending to other organizations regardless of whether they are organizations of Indians. However, not more than 50 percent of the loan made to an Indian organization may be used for the purpose of making a loan to or investing in other organizations. Applications for loans to provide funds for lending to or investing in other organizations already in operation will be accompanied by:

      (1) Audited balance sheets and operating statements of the other organization for the immediate three preceding years;

      (5) Names of members of the board of directors and officers with a resume of education and experience, and the number of shares of stock owned by each in the corporation;

      (6) Purposes for which loan or investment will be used; and

      (7) If for manufacturing, selling or providing services, a market and capacity report will be prepared. If a proposed operation is to be established, the information in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this section will be furnished. The Commissioner may require additional information on the other organization, if needed, to adequately evaluate the benefits which the Indian organization will receive and the economic benefits which will accrue to a reservation. If the loan is for relending to another organization, the application must show what security is being offered. If the loan is for investment in another organization, the equity to be obtained must be shown. Copies of all agreements, contracts or other documents to be executed by the Indian organization and the other organization in connection with a loan or investment shall be submitted with the application for a loan and will require Commissioner approval prior to disbursement of loan funds to the Indian organization.

      § 101.3   Eligible borrowers under United States direct loan program.

#### § § 101.3

      (a) Loans may be made from the revolving loan fund to Indians, eligible tribes and relending organizations, and corporations, cooperative associations and partnerships having a form of organization satisfactory to the Commissioner. Loans may be made to applicants only when, in the judgment of the Commissioner, there is a reasonable prospect of repayment. Loans may be made only to an applicant who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions from other sources such as tribal relending programs, banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production Credit Associations, or Federal Land Banks, and is also unable to obtain a guaranteed or insured loan pursuant to title II of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77). In addition, the applicant will be required to have equity equal to 20 percent of the total cost of a new enterprise, or 20 percent of the total cost of expansion of an existing enterprise.

      (b) The establishment of a United States direct revolving loan program on a reservation(s) for making direct loans will require the approval of the Commissioner. All requests for establishing a United States direct revolving loan program on a reservation will be accompanied by reasons for need, estimate of financing needs, and other sources of financing available to meet the needs. The Commissioner, in approving a United States direct loan program, may require the preparation and approval of a plan of operation for conducting the program.

      (c) If local lending conditions and/or the information in an application for a loan indicate a probability that an applicant may be able to obtain the loan from other sources, the Commissioner, before approving a United States direct loan, will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area who are making loans for similar purposes, stating whether or not they are willing to make a loan to the applicant for the same purposes and amount. If a customary lender will make the loan on reasonable terms and conditions, the Commissioner will not approve a United States direct loan.

      § 101.5   Approval of loans.

#### § § 101.5

      (a) Loan agreements, including those used by relending organizations in operating a relending program, must be executed on a form approved by the Commissioner. On direct United States loans, the Commissioner will approve the loan by issuing a commitment order covering the terms and conditions for making the loan.

      (b) Applications for loans from relending organizations must be approved, if a tribe, by the governing body or designated committee, or other approving committee or body authorized to act on credit matters for a relending organization, before the Commissioner takes action on the application. This designated governing body of the tribe or committee must be authorized to act on behalf of the relending organization as evidenced in the organization's declaration of policy and plan of operation.

      (c) Corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations organized for the purpose of establishing, acquiring, expanding, and operating an economic enterprise shall be organized pursuant to federal, state or tribal law. The form of organization shall be acceptable to the Commissioner. Economic enterprises which are or will be operated on a reservation(s) must comply with the requirements of applicable rules, resolutions and ordinances enacted by the governing body of the tribe.

      § 101.6   Modification of loans.

#### § § 101.6

      (a)  Any modification of the terms and provisions of a United States direct loan agreement must be requested in writing by the borrower and approved by the Commissioner. The borrower will submit the request for modification and will indicate the section(s) of the loan agreement to be modified together with a justification for the modification. Requests for modifications of loan agreements will include an agreement to abide by the provisions of the regulations in this part and future amendments and modifications thereof. In addition, a current credit bureau report, obtained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will be made a part of the modification request.

      (b)  Any modification of the terms and provisions of a loan agreement of a borrower from an organization conducting a relending program must be in writing, agreed to by the borrower, and must be approved by the body authorized to act on loans and modifications thereof as provided in an approved declaration of policy and plan of operation or other plan. If a request for modification of a loan has been disapproved by the body authorized to act on the request, the rejected borrower may request the Commissioner to make a direct loan from the revolving loan fund if the Commissioner determines that the rejection is unwarranted.

#### § § 101.7

      Prior to and concurrent with the approval of a United States direct loan to finance an economic enterprise, the Commissioner will assure under title V of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 that competent management and technical assistance is available to the loan applicant for preparation of the application and/or administration of funds loaned consistent with the nature of the enterprise proposed to be or in fact funded by the loan. Assistance may be provided by available Bureau of Indian Affairs staff, the tribe or other sources which the Commissioner considers competent to provide needed assistance. Contracting for management and technical assistance may be used only when adequate assistance is not available without additional cost. Contracts for providing borrowers with competent management and technical assistance shall be in accordance with applicable Federal Procurement Regulations and the Buy Indian Act of April 30, 1908, chapter 153 (35 Stat. 71), as amended June 25, 1910, chapter 431, section 25 (36 Stat. 861).

      § 101.8   Environmental and Flood Disaster Acts.

#### § § 101.8

      Loans will not be approved until there is assurance of compliance with any applicable provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, 87 Stat. 975), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190), (42 U.S.C. 4321) and Executive Order 11514.

      § 101.9   Preservation of historical and archeological data.

#### § § 101.9

      (a) On United States direct loans from the revolving loan fund and modifications thereof to provide additional loan funds which will involve excavations, road or street construction, land development or disturbance of land on known or reported historical or archeological sites, the Commissioner will take or require appropriate action to assure compliance with the applicable provisions of the Act of June 27, 1960 (74 Stat. 220; (16 U.S.C. 469)), as amended by the Act of May 24, 1974 (Pub. L. 93-291, 88 Stat. 174).

      (b) On loans made by relending organizations conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds, the body authorized to act on loan applications and modifications thereof will, at the time of taking action on a loan or request for modification, inform the applicant of the applicability of this Act to the loan and advise the Commissioner of compliance or the need to obtain compliance.

      § 101.10   Federal Reserve Regulation Z and Fair Credit Reporting Act.

#### § § 101.10

      (a) United States direct loans and loans made by a relending organization are subject to the provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation Z (Truth In Lending, 12 CFR part 226; Pub. L. 91-508, 84 Stat. 1127). Economic enterprises which extend credit and require payment of finance charges on unpaid balances will determine the applicability of Regulation Z and comply with the requirements thereof. The Commissioner will issue any necessary instructions to assure compliance with Regulation Z on United States direct loans.

      (b) Relending organizations, through their committee or other body authorized to act on loan matters on its behalf, will assure compliance with the applicable provisions of this Act.

      (c) The Commissioner will require adherence to the provisions and requirements of title VI of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in making United States direct loans. Relending organizations, through the body authorized to act on credit matters, will require compliance with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

      § 101.11   Interest.

#### § § 101.11

      (a) The interest to be charged on loans by the United States shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with section 104, title I, of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-262, 88 Stat. 77). The interest rate shall be determined monthly and shall be effective on advances made on loans during the current calendar month. The interest rate shall be stated in the promissory note(s) executed by the borrower(s) evidencing the advance(s).

      (b) Additional charges to cover loan administration costs, including credit reports, may be charged to borrowers.

      (c) Education loans may provide for deferral of interest while the borrower is in school full time or in the military service.

      (d) The interest rate on loans made by relending organizations which are conducting relending programs shall not be less than the rate the organization pays on its loan(s) from the United States. Relending organizations which adopt and follow the same procedure in calculating interest on educational loans as is followed on educational loans made by the United States, will not be charged interest on loans from the United States on the amount outstanding on educational loans during the period the organization is not charging its borrowers interest.

      (e) Interest rates on loan advances made by the United States as shown on promissory notes dated before April 12, 1974, will remain in effect until the loan is paid in full, refinanced, or modified to extend the repayment terms. Unless otherwise specifically provided in a loan contract, the interest rate on advances made after April 12, 1974, will be at a rate determined pursuant to section 104 of title I of the Indian Financing Act of 1974. The interest rate on loans for expert assistance will be at a rate established in § 101.25 herein.

      § 101.12   Records and reports.

#### § § 101.12

      Loan agreements between the United States and tribes, corporations, partnerships, cooperative associations and individual Indians for financing economic enterprises, and to relending organizations, will require that borrowers establish and maintain accounting and operating records that are satisfactory to the Commissioner and submit written reports as required by the Commissioner. The records, accounts, and loan files shall be available for examination and audit by the Commissioner at any reasonable time. Unless an exception is approved by the Commissioner, borrowers will be required to have an annual audit made of the records of relending programs and economic enterprises financed with revolving loan funds, by a certified public accountant or a firm of certified public accountants or other qualified public accountants satisfactory to the Commissioner.

      § 101.13   Security.

#### § § 101.13

      (a) United States direct loans shall be secured by such security as the Commissioner may require. A lack of security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. Loans made by relending organizations conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds will require borrowers to give security for loans, if available, but the absence of security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. The declaration of policy and plan of operation of relending organizations conducting relending programs will include provisions covering the type and amount of security to be taken to secure loans made.

      (b) Land purchased by an individual Indian with the proceeds of a loan and land already held in trust or restricted status by the individual Indian may be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance with 25 CFR 152.34 and the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; (25 U.S.C. 483a)). Mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land will include only an acreage of the borrower's land which the Commissioner determines is necessary to protect the loan in case of default. On proposed foreclosures which involve the sale of individually held trust or restricted land given as security for a loan, the tribe of the reservation on which the land is located will be notified in writing at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated date of sale. Land purchased by a tribe with the proceeds of a loan from the revolving loan fund with title taken in a trust or restricted status, and land already held in a trust or restricted status by a tribe may not be mortgaged as security for a loan.

      (1) Title to any land purchased by a tribe or by an individual Indian with revolving loan funds may be taken in trust or restricted status unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a reservation or a tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary. Title to any land purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is outside the boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area may be taken in trust if the purchaser was the owner of trust or restricted interests in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title shall be taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on alienation, control, or use.

      (c) Mortgages of leasehold interests in land held in trust or restricted status by an individual Indian, may be taken for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development and improvement of the leased premises when permitted in the lease or lease modification agreement. Such mortgages must be approved by the lessor and Commissioner. (70 Stat. 62, (25 U.S.C. 483a)).

      (d) Individuals may give assignments of income from trust property as security for loans. Tribes may give assignments of trust income as security for loans provided that the assignment shall be specific as to the source(s) of income being assigned. All assignments of trust income require approval by the Commissioner before becoming effective.

      (e) Chattels may be given as security for a loan. A mortgage on chattels, the title to which is known to be in trust, requires Commissioner approval. Non-trust chattels may be mortgaged without approval of any federal official.

      (f) Crops grown on lands held in trust or restricted status for the benefit of an individual Indian may be given as security for a loan when approved by the Commissioner. Crops grown on leased, trust or restricted land may be given as security for a loan when permitted by the provisions of a lease or when the owner gives written consent. Approval of the lien document by the Commissioner is required. Crops grown on trust or restricted land held by a tribe which has been assigned to an individual for use may be given as security for a loan, provided the terms of the assignment permit the assignee to give the crops as security for a loan or the tribe's governing body specifically gives consent. The lien document requires Commissioner approval. Crops grown on non-trust or non-restricted land may be mortgaged without the approval of any federal official.

      (g) Title to any personal property purchased with a loan shall be taken in the name of the purchaser and mortgaged to secure the loan unless the loan is otherwise adequately secured. Tribes must adhere to the provisions of their constitutions and bylaws, corporate charters, or other organizational documents when mortgaging tribal property and assigning trust income as security for loans.

      (h) Relending organizations receiving a loan from the United States for relending shall be required to assign to the United States as security for the loan all securities acquired in connection with loans made to its members, sub-organizations, or associations from such funds, unless the Commissioner determines that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise reasonably assured. Funds advanced to finance a tribal economic enterprise shall be secured by an assignment of net income and net assets of the economic enterprise, unless the Commissioner determines that it is not feasible to require an assignment or that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise reasonably assured.

      (i) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or recorded in accordance with applicable state or federal laws except for those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages on documented vessels will be filed at the customs house designated as the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

      § 101.14   Maturity.

#### § § 101.14

      The maturity of any United States direct loan shall not exceed thirty years. Loans made will be scheduled for repayment at the earliest possible date consistent with the purpose of the loan and the repayment capacity of the borrower.

      § 101.15   Penalties on default.

#### § § 101.15

      Unless otherwise provided in the loan agreement between the United States and a borrower, failure on the part of a borrower to conform to the terms of the loan agreement will be deemed grounds for the taking of any one or all of the following steps by the Commissioner:

      (a) Discontinue any further advance of funds contemplated by the loan agreement.

      (b) Take possession of any or all collateral given as security and in the case of individuals, corporation, partnerships or cooperative associations, the property purchased with the borrowed funds.

      (c) Prosecute legal action against the borrower or against officers of corporations, tribes, bands, credit associations, cooperative associations, and other organizations.

      (d) Declare the entire amount advanced immediately due and payable.

      (e) Prevent further disbursement of credit funds under the control of the borrower.

      (f) Withdraw any unobligated funds from the borrower.

      (g) Require relending organizations conducting a relending program to apply all collections on loans to liquidate the debt to the United States.

      (h) Take possession of the assets of a relending organization conducting a relending program and exercise or arrange to exercise its powers until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its repayment of the revolving loan and compliance with the provisions of the terms of the loan agreement.

      (i) Liquidate, operate or arrange for the operation of economic enterprises financed with revolving loans made to individuals, tribes, corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations until the indebtedness is paid or until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its repayment and compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.

      (j) Report the name and account information of a delinquent borrower to a credit bureau.

      (k) Assess additional interest and penalty charges for the period of time that payment is not made.

      (l) Assess charges to cover additional administrative costs incurred by the Government to service the account.

      (m) Offset amounts owed the borrower under other Federal programs including other programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

      (n) Refer the account to a private collection agency to collect the amount due.

      (o) Refer the account to the U.S. Department of Justice for collection by litigation.

      (p) If the borrower is a current or retired Federal employee, take action to offset the borrower's salary or civil service retirement benefits.

      (q) Refer the debt to the Internal Revenue Service for offset against any amount owed the borrower as an income tax refund.

      (r) Report any written-off debt to the Internal Revenue Service as taxable income to the borrower.

      (s) Recommend suspension or debarment from conducting further business with the Federal Government.

      § 101.16   Default on loans made by relending organizations.

#### § § 101.16

      Relending organizations conducting relending programs using revolving loan funds will follow prudent lending practices in making and servicing loans and take appropriate actions to protect their interests in the security given to secure repayment of loans. Declarations of policy and plans of operation shall include procedures which will be followed in acting to correct a default, such as modification of loan agreement or foreclosure and liquidation of security. Relending organizations employing a general counsel will refer legal questions on foreclosure procedures and sale of security to their counsel.

      § 101.17   Uncollectable loans made by the United States.

#### § § 101.17

      If the Secretary determines that a United States direct loan is uncollectable in whole or in part or is collectable only at an unreasonable cost, or when such action would be in the best interest of the United States, the Secretary may cancel, adjust, compromise, or reduce the amount of any loan made from the revolving loan fund. The Commissioner may adjust, compromise, subordinate, or modify the terms of any mortgage, lease, assignment, contract, agreement, or other document taken as security for loans. The cancellation of all or part of a loan shall become effective when signed by the Secretary.

> [54 FR 34975, Aug. 23, 1989]

      § 101.18   Uncollectible loans made by relending organizations.

#### § § 101.18

      (a) Relending organizations conducting relending programs using revolving loan funds may, when approved by the Commissioner, chargeoff as uncollectible all or part of the balance of principal and interest owing on loans which are considered to be uncollectible. Usually a chargeoff includes both principal and interest and provides for cessation of interest accruals on the principal balance owing as of the date of the chargeoff.

      (b) Action to chargeoff a loan will be in the form of a resolution enacted by the committee or body authorized and responsible for actions on loan matters for the relending organization. Before action is taken to chargeoff a loan as uncollectible, the lender will make an effort, to the extent feasible, to liquidate the security given for a loan and apply the net proceeds as a repayment on the balance of principal and interest owed. The chargeoff of a loan by a relending organization as uncollectible will not reduce the principal balance owed to the United States. A chargeoff will not release the borrower of the obligation or the responsibility to make payments when his or her financial situation will permit. Chargeoff action will not release the lender of responsibility to continue its efforts to collect the loan.

      § 101.19   Assignment of loans.

#### § § 101.19

      A borrower of a direct loan from the United States may not assign the loan agreement or any interest in it to a third party without the consent of the Commissioner. Relending organizations which are conducting relending programs may not assign the loan agreements of borrowers, or any interest therein, to third parties without the approval of the Commissioner and the borrower.

      § 101.20   Relending by borrower.

#### § § 101.20

      (a) A relending organization may reloan funds loaned to it by the United States with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may authorize such lenders to approve applications for particular types of loans up to a specified amount.

      (b) Loans shall be secured by such securities as the lender and the Commissioner may require. With the Commissioner's approval, mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land, leasehold interests, chattels, crops grown on trust or restricted land, and assignments of trust income may all be taken as security for loans.

      (e) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or recorded in accordance with federal or state law except those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices.

      (b) No loan shall be approved if the applicant has funds available on deposit in the United States Treasury or elsewhere in an amount adequate to obtain the expert assistance needed or if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the fees to be paid the experts are unreasonable on the basis of the services to be performed by them.

      (c) Contracts for the employment of experts are subject to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 81 and require approval by the Commissioner.

      (e) Requests for advances under the loan agreement shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the borrower certifying that the borrower does not have adequate funds available from its own financial resources with which to pay the expert. The Superintendent and Area Director will attest to the accuracy of the statement or point out inaccuracies. A copy of the voucher or claim from the expert will accompany the request for advance.

      (f) Loan funds will be advanced only as needed to pay obligations incurred under approved contracts for expert assistance. The funds will be deposited in a separate account, shall not be commingled with other funds of the borrower, and shall not be disbursed for any other purpose.

      (g) Loans shall bear interest at the rate of 5  percent per annum from the date funds are advanced until the loan is repaid.

      (h) The principal amount of the loan advanced plus interest shall be repayable from the proceeds of any judgment received by the borrower at the time funds from the award become available to make the payment.

    PART 103—LOAN GUARANTY, INSURANCE, AND INTEREST SUBSIDY

### Part 103

**Authority:** Authority: 25 U.S.C. 1498, 1511.

**Source:** Source: 66 FR 3867, Jan. 17, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 103.1   What does this part do?

#### § § 103.1

        This part explains how to obtain and use a BIA loan guaranty or loan insurance agreement under the Program, and who may do so. It also describes how to obtain and use interest subsidy payments under the Program, and who may do so.

        § 103.2   Who does the Program help?

#### § § 103.2

        The purpose of the Program is to encourage eligible borrowers to develop viable Indian businesses through conventional lender financing. The direct function of the Program is to help lenders reduce excessive risks on loans they make. That function in turn helps borrowers secure conventional financing that might otherwise be unavailable.

        § 103.3   Who administers the Program?

#### § § 103.3

        Authority for administering the Program ultimately rests with the Secretary, who may exercise that authority directly at any time. Absent a direct exercise of authority, however, the Secretary delegates Program authority to BIA officials through the U.S. Department of Interior Departmental Manual. A lender should submit all applications and correspondence to the BIA office serving the borrower's location.

        § 103.4   What kinds of loans will BIA guarantee or insure?

#### § § 103.4

        In general, BIA may guarantee or insure any loan made by an eligible lender to an eligible borrower to conduct a lawful business organized for profit. There are several important exceptions:

        (a) The business must contribute to the economy of an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA;

        (b) The borrower may not use the loan for relending purposes;

        (c) If any portion of the loan is used to refinance an existing loan, the borrower must be current on the existing loan; and

        (d) BIA may not guarantee or insure a loan if it believes the lender would be willing to extend the requested financing without a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage.

        § 103.5   What size loan will BIA guarantee or insure?

#### § § 103.5

        BIA can guarantee or insure a loan or combination of loans of up to $500,000 for an individual Indian, or more for an acceptable Indian business entity, Tribe, or tribal enterprise involving two or more persons. No individual Indian may have an outstanding principal balance of more than $500,000 in guaranteed or insured loans at any time. BIA can limit the size of loans it will guarantee or insure, depending on the resources BIA has available.

        § 103.6   To what extent will BIA guarantee or insure a loan?

#### § § 103.6

        (a) BIA can guarantee up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest due on a loan.

        (b) BIA can insure up to the lesser of:

        (1) 90 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest due on a loan; or

        (2) 15 percent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all loans the lender has insured under the Program as of the date the lender makes a claim under its insurance coverage.

        (c) BIA's guaranty certificate or loan insurance agreement should reflect the lowest guaranty or insurance percentage rate that satisfies the lender's risk management requirements.

        (d) Absent exceptional circumstances, BIA will allow no more than:

        (1) Two simultaneous guarantees under the Program covering outstanding loans from the same lender to the same borrower; or

        (2) One loan guaranty under the Program when the lender simultaneously has one or more outstanding loans insured under the Program to the same borrower.

        § 103.7   Must the borrower have equity in the business being financed?

#### § § 103.7

        The borrower must be projected to have at least 20 percent equity in the business being financed, immediately after the loan is funded. If a substantial portion of the loan is for construction or renovation, the borrower's equity may be calculated based upon the reasonable estimated value of the borrower's assets after completion of the construction or renovation.

        § 103.8   Is there any cost for a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage?

#### § § 103.8

        BIA charges the lender a premium for a guaranty or insurance coverage.

        (a) The premium is:

        (1) Two percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA guarantees; or

        (2) One percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA insures, without considering the 15 percent aggregate outstanding principal limitation on the lender's insured loans.

        (b) Lenders may pass the cost of the premium on to the borrower, either by charging a one-time fee or by adding the cost to the principal amount of the borrower's loan. Adding the premium to the principal amount of the loan will not make any further premium due. BIA will guarantee or insure the additional principal to the same extent as the original approved principal amount.

      Subpart B—How a Lender Obtains a Loan Guaranty or Insurance Coverage

        § 103.9   Who applies to BIA under the Program?

#### § § 103.9

        The lender is responsible for determining whether it will require a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage, based upon the loan application it receives from an eligible borrower. If the lender requires a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender is responsible for completing and submitting a guaranty application or complying with a loan insurance agreement under the Program.

        § 103.10   What lenders are eligible under the Program?

#### § § 103.10

        (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a lender is eligible under the Program, and may be considered for BIA approval, if the lender is:

        (1) Regularly engaged in the business of making loans;

        (2) Capable of evaluating and servicing loans in accordance with reasonable and prudent industry standards; and

        (3) Otherwise reasonably acceptable to BIA.

        (b) The following lenders are not qualified to issue loans under the Program:

        (1) An agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;

        (2) A lender that borrows money from any Federal Government source, other than the Federal Reserve Bank System, for purposes of relending;

        (3) A lender that does not include the interest on loans it makes in gross income, for purposes of chapter 1, title 26 of the United States Code; and

        (4) A lender that does not keep any ownership interest in loans it originates.

        § 103.11   How does BIA approve lenders for the Program?

#### § § 103.11

        (a) BIA approves each lender by entering into a loan guaranty agreement and/or a loan insurance agreement with it. BIA may provide up to three different levels of approval for a lender making guaranteed loans, depending on factors such as:

        (1) The number of loans the lender makes under the Program;

        (2) The total principal balance of the lender's Program loans;

        (3) The number of years the lender has been involved with the Program;

        (4) The relative benefits and opportunities the lender has given to Indian business efforts through the Program; and

        (5) The lender's historical compliance with Program requirements.

        (b) BIA will consider a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement suspended as of:

        (1) The effective date of a change in the lender's corporate structure;

        (2) The effective date of a merger between the lender and any other entity, when the lender is not the surviving entity; or

        (3) The start of any legal proceeding in which substantially all of the lender's assets may be subject to disposition through laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership.

        (c) A change in a lender's name, without any other change specified under paragraph (b) of this section, will not cause a suspension of the lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement. The lender should notify BIA of its name change as soon as possible.

        (d) If a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement is suspended under paragraph (b) of this section, the lender, or its successor in interest, must enter into a new loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement with BIA in order to secure any new BIA loan guarantees or insurance coverage.

        (e) The suspension of a loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement does not affect the validity of any guaranty certificate or insurance coverage in effect before the date of the suspension. Any such certificate or insurance coverage will remain governed by applicable terms of the suspended loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement.

        § 103.12   How does a lender apply for a loan guaranty?

#### § § 103.12

        To apply for a loan guaranty, a BIA-approved lender must submit to BIA a loan guaranty application request form, together with each of the following:

        (a) A written explanation from the lender indicating why it needs a BIA guaranty for the loan, and the minimum loan guarantee percentage it will accept;

        (b) A copy of the borrower's complete loan application;

        (c) A description of the borrower's equity in the business being financed;

        (d) A copy of the lender's independent credit analysis of the borrower's business, repayment ability, and loan collateral (including insurance);

        (e) An original report from a nationally-recognized credit bureau, dated within 90 days of the date of the lender's loan guaranty application package, outlining the credit history of the borrower, and to the extent permitted by law, each co-maker or guarantor of the loan (if any);

        (f) A copy of the lender's loan commitment letter to the borrower, showing at a minimum the proposed loan amount, purpose, interest rate, schedule of payments, and security (including insurance requirements), and the lender's terms and conditions for funding;

        (g) The lender's good faith estimate of any loan-related fees and costs it will charge the borrower, as authorized under this part;

        (h) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance construction, renovation, or demolition work, the lender's:

        (1) Insurance and bonding requirements for the work;

        (2) Proposed draw requirements; and

        (3) Proposed work inspection procedures;

        (i) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to refinance or otherwise retire existing indebtedness:

        (1) A clear description of all loans being paid off, including the names of all makers, cosigners and guarantors, maturity dates, payment schedules, uncured delinquencies, collateral, and payoff amounts as of a specific date; and

        (2) A comparison of the terms of the loan or loans being paid off and the terms of the new loan, identifying the advantages of the new loan over the loan being paid off.

        § 103.13   How does a lender apply for loan insurance coverage?

#### § § 103.13

        BIA-approved lenders can make loans insured under the Program in two ways, depending on the size of the loan:

        (a) For loans in an original principal amount of up to $100,000 per borrower, the lender can make each loan in accordance with the lender's loan insurance agreement, without specific prior approval from BIA.

        (b) For loans in an original principal amount of over $100,000, the lender must seek BIA's specific prior approval in each case. The lender must submit a loan insurance coverage application request form, together with the same information required for a loan guaranty under § 103.12, except for the information required by § 103.12(a).

        (c) The lender must submit a loan insurance application package even for a loan of less than $100,000 if:

        (1) The total outstanding balance of all insured loans the lender is extending to the borrower under the Program exceeds $100,000; or

        (2) the lender makes a request for interest subsidy, pursuant to § 103.21.

        § 103.14   Can BIA request additional information?

#### § § 103.14

        BIA may require the lender to provide additional information, whenever BIA believes it needs the information to properly evaluate a new lender, guaranty application, or insurance application. After BIA issues a loan guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender must let BIA inspect the lender's records at any reasonable time for information concerning the Program.

        § 103.15   Are there any prohibited loan terms?

#### § § 103.15

        A loan agreement guaranteed or insured under the Program may not contain:

        (a) Charges by the lender styled as “points,” loan origination fees, or any similar fees (however named), except that if authorized in the loan agreement, the lender may charge the borrower a reasonable annual loan servicing fee that:

        (1) Is not included as part of the loan principal; and

        (2) Does not bear interest;

        (b) Charges of any kind by the lender or by any third party except for the reasonable and customary cost of legal and architectural services, broker commissions, surveys, compliance inspections, title inspection and/or insurance, lien searches, appraisals, recording costs, premiums for required hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance, and such other charges as BIA may approve in writing;

        (c) A loan repayment term of over 30 years;

        (d) Payments scheduled less frequently than annually;

        (e) A prepayment penalty, unless the terms of the penalty are clearly specified in BIA's loan guaranty or loan insurance conditions;

        (f) An interest rate greater than what BIA considers reasonable, taking into account the range of rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans;

        (g) A variable interest rate, unless the rate is tied to a specific prime rate published from time to time by a nationally recognized financial institution or news source;

        (h) An increased rate of interest based on default;

        (i) A fee imposed for the late repayment of any installment due, except for a late fee that:

        (1) Is imposed only after the borrower is at least 30 days late with payment;

        (2) Does not bear interest; and

        (3) Equals no more than 5 percent of the late installment;

        (j) An “insecurity” clause, or any similar provision permitting the lender to declare a loan default solely on the basis of its subjective view of the borrower's changed repayment prospects;

        (k) A requirement that the borrower take title to any real or personal property purchased with loan proceeds by a title instrument containing restrictions on alienation, control or use of the property, unless otherwise required by applicable law; or

        (l) A requirement that a borrower which is a tribe provide as security a general assignment of the tribe's trust income. If otherwise lawful, a tribe may provide as loan security an assignment of trust income from a specific source.

        § 103.16   How does BIA approve or reject a loan guaranty or insurance application?

#### § § 103.16

        (a) BIA reviews each guaranty or insurance application, and may evaluate each loan application independently from the lender. BIA bases its loan guaranty or insurance decisions on many factors, including compliance with this part, and whether there is a reasonable prospect of loan repayment from business cash flow, or if necessary, from liquidating loan collateral. Lenders are expected to obtain a first lien security interest in enough collateral to reasonably secure repayment of each loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, to the extent that collateral is available.

        (b) BIA approves applications by issuing an approval letter, followed by the procedures in § 103.18. If the guaranty or insurance application is incomplete, BIA may return the application to the lender, or hold the application while the lender submits the missing information. If BIA denies the application, it will provide the lender with a written explanation, with a copy to the borrower.

        § 103.17   Must the lender follow any special procedures to close the loan?

#### § § 103.17

        (a) BIA officials or their representatives may attend the closing of any loan or loan modification that BIA agrees to guarantee or insure. For guaranteed loans, and insured loans that BIA must individually review under this part, the lender must give BIA notice of the date of closing at least 5 business days before closing occurs.

        (b) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain appropriate, satisfactory title and/or lien searches for each asset to be used as loan collateral.

        (c) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain recent appraisals for all real property and improvements to be used as collateral for the loan, to the extent required by law.

        (d) At or prior to closing, the lender must document that the lender and borrower have complied with all applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws implicated by financing the borrower's business, for example by securing:

        (1) Copies of all permits and licenses required to operate the borrower's business;

        (2) Environmental studies required for construction and/or business operations under NEPA and other environmental laws;

        (3) Archeological or historical studies required by law; and

        (4) Certification by a registered surveyor or appropriate BIA official indicating that the proposed business will not be located in a special flood hazard area, as defined by applicable law.

        (e) The lender must supply BIA with copies of all final, signed loan closing documents within 30 days following closing. To the extent applicable, loan closing documents must include the following:

        (1) Promissory notes;

        (2) Security agreements, including pledge and similar agreements, and related financing statements (together with BIA's written approval of any assignment of specific tribal trust assets under § 103.15(l), or of any security interest in an individual Indian money account);

        (3) Mortgage instruments or deeds of trust (together with BIA's written approval, if required by 25 U.S.C. 483a, or if the mortgage is of a leasehold interest in tribal trust property);

        (4) Guarantees (other than from BIA);

        (5) Construction contracts, and plans and specifications;

        (6) Leases related to the business (together with BIA's written approval, if required under 25 CFR part 162);

        (7) Attorney opinion letters;

        (8) Resolutions made by a Tribe or business entity;

        (9) Waivers or partial waivers of sovereign immunity; and

        (10) Similar instruments designed to document the loan, establish the basis for a security interest in loan collateral, and comply with applicable law.

        (f) Unless BIA indicates otherwise in writing, the lender must close a guaranteed or insured loan within 90 days of any approval provided under § 103.16.

        § 103.18   How does BIA issue a loan guaranty or confirm loan insurance?

#### § § 103.18

        (a) A loan is guaranteed under the Program when all of the following occur:

        (1) BIA issues a signed loan guaranty certificate bearing a series number, an authorized signature, a guaranty percentage rate, the lender's name, the borrower's name, the original principal amount of the loan, and such other terms and conditions as BIA may require;

        (2) The loan closes and funds;

        (3) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan guaranty premium; and

        (4) The lender meets all of the conditions listed in the loan guaranty certificate.

        (b) A loan is insured under the Program when all of the following occur:

        (1) The loan's purpose and terms meet the requirements of the Program and the lender's loan insurance agreement with BIA;

        (2) The loan closes and funds;

        (3) The lender notifies BIA of the borrower's identity and organizational structure, the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the payment schedule, and the date on which the loan closing and funding occurred;

        (4) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan insurance premium;

        (5) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, BIA approves the loan in writing; and

        (6) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, the lender meets all of the conditions listed in BIA's written loan approval.

        § 103.19   When must the lender pay BIA the loan guaranty or insurance premium?

#### § § 103.19

        The premium is due within 30 calendar days of the loan closing. If not paid on time, BIA will send the lender written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required), stating that the premium is due immediately. If the lender fails to make the premium payment within 30 calendar days of the date of BIA's notice, BIA's guaranty certificate or insurance coverage with respect to that particular loan is void, without further action.

      Subpart C—Interest Subsidy

        § 103.20   What is interest subsidy?

#### § § 103.20

        Interest subsidy is a payment BIA makes for the benefit of the borrower, to reimburse part of the interest payments the borrower has made on a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program. It is available to borrowers whose projected or historical earnings before interest and taxes, after adjustment for extraordinary items, is less than the industry norm.

        § 103.21   Who applies for interest subsidy payments, and what is the application procedure?

#### § § 103.21

        (a) An eligible lender must request interest subsidy payments on behalf of an eligible borrower, after determining that the borrower qualifies. Typically, the lender should include a request for interest subsidy at the time it applies for a guaranty or insurance coverage under the Program. A request for interest subsidy must be supported by the information required in §§ 103.12 and 103.13 (relating to loan guaranty and insurance coverage applications). BIA approves, returns, or rejects interest subsidy requests in the same manner indicated in § 103.16, based on the factors in § 103.20 and BIA's available resources.

        (b) BIA's approval of interest subsidy for an insured loan may provide for specific limitations on the manner in which the lender and borrower can modify the loan.

        § 103.22   How does BIA determine the amount of interest subsidy?

#### § § 103.22

        Interest subsidy payments should equal the difference between the lender's rate of interest and the rate determined in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1464. BIA will fix the amount of interest subsidy as of the date it approves the interest subsidy request.

        § 103.23   How does BIA make interest subsidy payments?

#### § § 103.23

        The lender must send BIA reports at least quarterly on the borrower's loan payment history, together with a calculation of the interest subsidy then due. The lender's reports and calculation do not have to be in any specific format, but in addition to the calculation the reports must contain at least the information required by § 103.33(a). Based on the lender's reports and calculation, BIA will send interest subsidy payments to the borrower in care of the lender. The payments belong to the borrower, but the borrower and lender may agree in advance on how the borrower will use interest subsidy payments. BIA may verify and correct interest subsidy calculations and payments at any time.

        § 103.24   How long will BIA make interest subsidy payments?

#### § § 103.24

        (a) BIA will issue interest subsidy payments for the term of the loan, up to 3 years. If interest subsidy payments still are justified, the lender may apply for up to two 1-year extensions of this initial term. BIA will make interest subsidy payments on a single loan for no more than 5 years.

        (b) BIA will choose the date from which it calculates interest subsidy years, usually the date the lender first extends the loan funds. Interest subsidy payments will apply to all loan payments made in the calendar years following that date.

        (c) Interest subsidy payments will not be due for any loan payment made after the corresponding loan guaranty or insurance coverage stops under the Program, regardless of the circumstances.

      Subpart D—Provisions Relating to Borrowers

        § 103.25   What kind of borrower is eligible under the Program?

#### § § 103.25

        (a) A borrower is eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan if the borrower is:

        (1) An Indian individual;

        (2) An Indian-owned business entity organized under Federal, State, or tribal law, with an organizational structure reasonably acceptable to BIA;

        (3) A tribe; or

        (4) A business enterprise established and recognized by a tribe.

        (b) To be eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan, a business entity or tribal enterprise must be at least 51 percent owned by Indians. If at any time a business entity or tribal enterprise becomes less than 51 percent Indian owned, the lender either may declare a default as of the date the borrower stopped being at least 51 percent Indian owned and exercise its remedies under this part, or else continue to extend the loan to the borrower and allow BIA's guaranty or insurance coverage to become invalid.

> [66 FR 3867, Jan. 17, 2001; 66 FR 46307, Sept. 4, 2001]

        § 103.26   What must the borrower supply the lender in its loan application?

#### § § 103.26

        The lender may use any form of loan application it chooses. However, the borrower must supply the lender the information listed in this section in order for BIA to process a guaranty or insurance coverage application:

        (a) The borrower's precise legal name, address, and tax identification number or social security number;

        (b) Proof of the borrower's eligibility under the Program;

        (c) A statement signed by the borrower, indicating that it is not delinquent on any Federal tax or other debt obligation;

        (d) The borrower's business plan, including resumes of all principals and a detailed discussion of the product or service to be offered, market factors, the borrower's marketing strategy, and any technical assistance the borrower may require;

        (e) A detailed description of the borrower's equity in the business being financed, including the method(s) of valuation;

        (f) The borrower's balance sheets and operating statements for the preceding 3 years, or so much of that period that the borrower has been in business;

        (g) The borrower's current financial statement, and the financial statements of all co-makers and guarantors of the loan (other than BIA);

        (h) At least 3 years of financial projections for the borrower's business, consisting of pro-forma balance sheets, operating statements, and cash flow statements;

        (i) A detailed list of all proposed collateral for the loan, including asset values and the method(s) of valuation;

        (j) A detailed list of all proposed hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance the borrower will maintain on its business assets and operations;

        (k) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance construction, renovation, or demolition work:

        (1) Written quotes for the work from established and reputable contractors; and

        (2) To the extent available, copies of all construction and architectural contracts for the work, plans and specifications, and applicable building permits;

        (l) If the borrower is a tribe or a tribal enterprise, resolutions by the tribe and proof of authority under tribal law permitting the borrower to borrow the loan amount and offer the proposed loan collateral; and

        (m) If the borrower is a business entity, resolutions by the appropriate governing officials and proof of authority under its organizing documents permitting the borrower to borrow the loan amount and offer the proposed loan collateral.

        § 103.27   Can the borrower get help preparing its loan application or putting its loan funds to use?

#### § § 103.27

        A borrower may seek BIA's assistance when preparing a loan application or when planning business operations, including assistance identifying and complying with applicable laws as indicated by § 103.17(d). The borrower should contact the BIA field or agency office serving the area in which the borrower's business is to be located, or if there is no separate field or agency office serving the area, then the borrower should contact the BIA regional office serving the area.

      Subpart E—Loan Transfers

        § 103.28   What if the lender transfers part of the loan to another person?

#### § § 103.28

        (a) A lender may transfer one or more interests in a guaranteed loan to another person or persons, as long as the parties have in place an agreement that designates one person to perform all of the duties required of the lender under the Program and the loan guaranty certificate. Starting on the date of the transfer, only the person designated to perform the duties of the lender will be entitled to exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty certificate, and will from that point forward be considered the lender for purposes of the Program. A lender under the Program must both service the guaranteed loan and own at least a 10 percent interest in the guaranteed loan. BIA will not consider more than one person at any given time to be the lender with respect to any loan guaranty certificate. If the person designated to perform the duties of the lender in an agreement among loan participants is not the original lender, then the provisions of § 103.29(a) will apply (relating to sale or assignment of guaranteed loans), and the person designated to perform the duties of the lender must give BIA notice of its interest in the loan. Failure to provide notice in accordance with § 103.29(a) will void BIA's loan guaranty certificate, without further action.

        (b) Transferring any interest in an insured loan to another person will void the insurance coverage for that loan, except where the transfer is effected by a merger.

        § 103.29   What if the lender transfers the entire loan?

#### § § 103.29

        (a) A lender may transfer all of its rights in a guaranteed loan to any other person. The acquiring person must send BIA written notice of the transfer, describing the borrower, the loan, BIA's loan guaranty certificate number, and the acquiring person's name and address. Starting on the date of the transfer, only the acquiring person will be entitled to exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty certificate, and will from that point forward be considered the lender for purposes of the Program. The acquiring person must service the guaranteed loan and otherwise perform all of the duties required of the lender under the Program and the loan guaranty certificate. Except when a transfer is effected by a merger, any failure by the acquiring person to send BIA proper notice of the transfer within 30 calendar days of the transfer date will void BIA's loan guaranty certificate, without further action.

        (b) Transferring an insured loan to another person will void the insurance coverage for that loan, except where the transfer is effected by a merger.

        (c) If a lender is not the surviving entity after a merger, the lender's successor must notify BIA in writing of the change within 30 calendar days of the merger. The lender also must re-apply to become an approved lender under the Program, as indicated in § 103.11.

      Subpart F—Loan Servicing Requirements

        § 103.30   What standard of care must a lender meet?

#### § § 103.30

        Lenders must service all loans guaranteed or insured under the Program in a commercially reasonable manner, in accordance with standards and procedures adopted by prudent lenders in the BIA region in which the borrower's business is located, and in accordance with this part. If the lender fails to follow any of these standards, BIA may reduce or eliminate entirely the amount payable under its guaranty or insurance coverage to the extent BIA can reasonably attribute the loss to the lender's failure. BIA also may deny payment completely if the lender gets a loan guaranty or insurance coverage through fraud, or negligently allows a borrower's fraudulent loan application or use of loan funds to go undetected. In particular, and without limitation, lenders must:

        (a) Check and verify information contained in the borrower's loan application, such as the borrower's eligibility, the authority of persons acting on behalf of the borrower, and the title status of any proposed collateral;

        (b) Take reasonable precautions to assure that loan proceeds are used as specified in BIA's guaranty certificate or written insurance approval, or if not so specified, then in descending order of importance:

        (1) BIA's written loan guaranty approval;

        (2) The loan documents;

        (3) The terms of the lender's final loan commitment to the borrower; or

        (4) The borrower's loan application;

        (c) When feasible, require the borrower to use automatic bank account debiting to make loan payments;

        (d) Require the borrower to take title to real and personal property purchased with loan proceeds in the borrower's own name, except for real property to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a borrower that is a tribe;

        (e) Promptly record all security interests and subsequently keep them in effect. Lenders must record all mortgages and other security interests in accordance with State and local law, including the laws of any tribe that may have jurisdiction. Lenders also must record any leasehold mortgages or assignments of income involving individual Indian or tribal trust land with the BIA office having responsibility for maintaining records on that trust land;

        (f) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower and any guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) keep current on all taxes levied on real and personal property used in the borrower's business or as collateral for the loan, and on all applicable payroll taxes;

        (g) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that all required insurance policies remain in effect, including hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance, in amounts reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the borrower, the borrower's business, and the lender;

        (h) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower remains in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, local and tribal laws, including environmental laws and laws concerning the preservation of historical and archeological sites and data;

        (i) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower causes any construction, renovation, or demolition work funded by the loan to proceed in accordance with approved construction contracts and plans and specifications, which must be sufficient in scope and detail to adequately govern the work;

        (j) Reserve for itself and BIA the right to inspect the borrower's business records and all loan collateral at any reasonable time;

        (k) Promptly notify the borrower in writing of any material breach by the borrower of the terms of its loan, with specific instructions on how to cure the breach and a deadline for doing so;

        (l) Participate in any probate, receivership, bankruptcy, or similar proceeding involving the borrower and any guarantor or co-maker of the borrower's debt, to the extent necessary to maintain the greatest possible rights to repayment; and

        (m) Otherwise seek to avoid and mitigate any potential loss arising from the loan, using at least that level of care the lender would use if it did not have a BIA loan guaranty or insurance coverage.

        § 103.31   What loan servicing requirements apply to BIA?

#### § § 103.31

        Once a lender extends a loan that is guaranteed or insured under the Program, BIA has no responsibility for decisions concerning it, except for:

        (a) Any approvals required under this part;

        (b) Any decisions reserved to BIA under conditions of BIA's guaranty certificate or insurance coverage; and

        (c) Decisions concerning a loan that the lender has assigned to BIA or to which BIA is subrogated by virtue of paying a claim based on a guaranty certificate or insurance coverage.

        § 103.32   What sort of loan documentation does BIA expect the lender to maintain?

#### § § 103.32

        For every loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, the lender must maintain:

        (a) BIA's original loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage approval letter, if applicable;

        (b) Original signed and/or certified counterparts of all final loan documents, including those listed in § 103.17 (concerning documents required for loan closing), all renewals, modifications, and additions to those documents, and signed settlement statements;

        (c) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all documents gathered by the lender under §§ 103.12, 103.13 and 103.26 (concerning information submitted by the borrower in its loan application, and information supplied to BIA in the lender's loan guaranty or insurance coverage application);

        (d) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all applicable insurance binders or certificates, including without limitation hazard, liability, key man life, and title insurance;

        (e) A complete and current history of all loan transactions, including dated disbursements, payments, adjustments, and notes describing all contacts with the borrower;

        (f) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence with the borrower, including default notices and evidence of receipt;

        (g) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence, notices, news items or other information concerning the borrower, whether gathered by the lender or furnished to it, containing material information about the borrower and its business operations;

        (h) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all advertisements, notices, title instruments, accountings, and other documentation of efforts to liquidate loan collateral; and

        (i) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all notices, pleadings, motions, orders, and other documents associated with any legal proceeding involving the lender and the borrower or its assets, including without limitation judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, suits to collect payment, bankruptcy proceedings, probate proceedings, and any settlement associated with threatened or actual litigation.

        § 103.33   Are there reporting requirements?

#### § § 103.33

        (a) The lender must periodically report the borrower's loan payment history so that BIA can recalculate the government's contingent liability. Loan payment history reports must be quarterly unless BIA provides otherwise for a particular loan. These reports can be in any format the lender desires, as long as they contain:

        (1) The lender's name;

        (2) The borrower's name;

        (3) A reference to BIA's Loan Guaranty Certificate or Loan Insurance Agreement number;

        (4) The lender's internal loan number; and

        (5) The date and amount of all loan balance activity for the reporting period.

        (b) If applicable, the lender must supply a calculation of any interest subsidy payments that are due, as indicated in § 103.23.

        (c) If there is a transfer of any or all of the lender's ownership interest in the loan, the party receiving the ownership interest may be required to notify BIA, as indicated in §§ 103.28 and 103.29.

        (d) If there is a default on the loan, the lender must notify BIA, as indicated in §§ 103.35 and 103.36.

        (e) If the borrower ceases to qualify for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan under § 103.25(b), the lender must promptly notify BIA even if the lender does not pursue default remedies under §§ 103.35 and 103.36. This notice allows BIA to eliminate the guaranty or insurance coverage from its active recordkeeping system.

        (f) If the loan is prepaid in full, the lender must promptly notify BIA in writing so that BIA can eliminate the guaranty or insurance coverage from its active recordkeeping system.

        (g) If a lender changes its name, it should notify BIA in accordance with § 103.11(c).

        § 103.34   What if the lender and borrower decide to change the terms of the loan?

#### § § 103.34

        (a) The lender must obtain written BIA approval before modifying a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, if the change will:

        (1) Increase the borrower's outstanding principal amount (if a term loan), or maximum available credit (if a revolving loan).

        (i) BIA will approve or disapprove a loan increase based upon the lender's explanation of the borrower's need for additional funding, and updated information of the sort required under §§ 103.12, 103.13, and 103.26, as applicable.

        (ii) Upon approval by BIA and payment of an additional guaranty or insurance premium in accordance with §§ 103.8 and 103.19 and this section, the entire outstanding loan amount, as modified, will be guaranteed or insured (as the case may be) to the extent BIA specifies. The lender must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the outstanding principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the increase in the credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving loan).

        (iii) Lenders may not increase the outstanding principal amount of a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program if a significant purpose of doing so would be to allow the borrower to pay accrued loan interest it otherwise would have difficulty paying.

        (2) Permanently adjust the loan repayment schedule.

        (3) Increase a fixed interest rate, convert a fixed interest rate to an adjustable interest rate, or convert an adjustable interest rate to a fixed interest rate.

        (4) Allow any changes in the identity or organizational structure of the borrower.

        (5) Allow any material change in the use of loan proceeds or the nature of the borrower's business.

        (6) Release any collateral taken as security for the loan, except items sold in the ordinary course of business and promptly replaced by similar items of collateral, such as inventory.

        (7) Allow the borrower to move any significant portion of its business operations to a location that is not on or near an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA.

        (8) Be likely to materially increase the risk of a claim on BIA's guaranty or insurance coverage, or materially reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the loan.

        (9) Cure a default for which BIA is to receive notice under § 103.35(b).

        (b) In the case of an insured loan, the amount of which will not exceed $100,000 when combined with all other insured loans from the lender to the borrower, the lender need not obtain BIA's prior approval to make any of the loan modifications indicated in § 103.34(a), except as provided in § 103.21(b). However, all loan modifications must remain consistent with the lender's loan insurance agreement with BIA, and in the event of an increase in the borrower's outstanding principal amount (if a term loan), or maximum available credit (if a revolving loan), the lender must send BIA an additional premium payment in accordance with §§ 103.8, 103.19 and this section. The lender must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the outstanding principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the increase in the credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving loan). To the extent a loan modification changes any of the information supplied to BIA under § 103.18(b)(3), the lender also must promptly notify BIA of the new information.

        (c) Subject to any applicable BIA loan guaranty or insurance coverage conditions, a lender may extend additional loans to a borrower without BIA approval, if the additional loans are not to be guaranteed or insured under the Program.

      Subpart G—Default and Payment by BIA

        § 103.35   What must the lender do if the borrower defaults on the loan?

#### § § 103.35

        (a) The lender must send written notice of the default to the borrower, and otherwise meet the standard of care established for the lender in this part. The lender's notice to the borrower should be sent as soon as possible after the default, but in any event before the lender's notice to BIA under paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes of the Program, “default” will mean a default as defined in this part.

        (b) The lender also must send written notice of the default to BIA by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 60 calendar days of the default, unless the default is fully cured before that deadline. This notice is required even if the lender grants the borrower a forbearance under § 103.36(a). One purpose of the notice is to give BIA the opportunity to intervene and seek assistance for the borrower, even though BIA has no duty, either to the lender or the borrower, to do so. Another purpose of the notice is to permit BIA to plan for a possible loss claim from the lender, under § 103.36(d). The lender's notice must clearly indicate:

        (1) The identity of the borrower;

        (2) The applicable Program guaranty certificate or insurance agreement number;

        (3) The date and nature of all bases for default;

        (4) If a monetary default, the amount of past due principal and interest, the date through which interest has been calculated, and the amount of any late fees, precautionary advances, or other amounts the lender claims;

        (5) The nature and outcome of any correspondence or other contacts with the borrower concerning the default; and

        (6) The precise nature of any action the borrower could take to cure the default.

        § 103.36   What options and remedies does the lender have if the borrower defaults on the loan?

#### § § 103.36

        (a) The lender may grant the borrower a temporary forbearance, even beyond any default cure periods specified in the loan documents, if doing so is likely to result in the borrower curing the default. However, BIA must approve in writing any forbearance or other agreement that:

        (1) Permanently modifies the terms of the loan in any manner indicated by § 103.34(a);

        (2) Would allow the borrower's default to extend beyond the deadline established in § 103.36(d) for the lender to elect a remedy; or

        (3) Is not likely to result in the borrower curing the default.

        (b) The lender may make precautionary advances on the borrower's behalf during the default, if doing so is reasonably necessary to ensure that loan recovery prospects do not significantly deteriorate. Items for which the lender may make precautionary advances include, for example:

        (1) Hazard, liability, or key man life insurance premiums;

        (2) Security measures to safeguard abandoned business assets;

        (3) Real or personal property taxes;

        (4) Corrective actions required by court or administrative orders; or

        (5) Essential maintenance.

        (c) BIA will guaranty or insure the amount of precautionary advances from the date of each advance to the same extent as other amounts due under the loan, if:

        (1) The borrower has demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to make the payment or perform the duty that jeopardizes loan recovery, including by undue delay in making the payment or performing the duty;

        (2) The total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender does not at the time of the advance exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan;

        (3) Where loan document provisions do not require the borrower to repay precautionary advances (however termed) when made by the lender, or where the total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender will exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan when made, the lender secures BIA's prior written approval; and

        (4) The lender properly claims and documents all precautionary advances, if and when it submits a claim for loss under § 103.37.

        (d) If the default remains uncured, the lender must send BIA a written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 90 calendar days of the default to select one of the following remedies:

        (1) In the case of a guaranteed loan, the lender may submit a claim to BIA for its loss;

        (2) In the case of either a guaranteed or insured loan, the lender may liquidate all collateral securing the loan, and upon completion, if it has a residual loss on the loan, it may submit a claim to BIA for that loss; or

        (3) The lender may negotiate a loan modification agreement with the borrower to permanently change the terms of the loan in a manner that will cure the default. If the lender chooses this remedy, it may take no longer than 45 calendar days from the date BIA receives the notice of remedy selection to finalize a loan modification agreement and secure BIA's written approval of it, unless BIA specifically extends this deadline in writing. However, the lender may at any time before the expiration of the 45-day period (or any extension thereof) change its choice of remedy by sending BIA a notice otherwise complying with § 103.36(d)(1) or (2). If the lender fails to send BIA a notice changing its choice of remedy and does not finalize an approved loan modification agreement within the 45-day period (or any extension thereof), the lender's only permissible remedy under the Program will be to pursue the procedure specified in § 103.36(d)(2).

        (e) Failure by the lender to provide BIA with notice of the lender's election of remedy within 90 calendar days of the default, as indicated in § 103.36(d), will invalidate BIA's loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage for that particular loan, absent an express waiver of this provision by BIA. BIA may preserve the validity of a loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage through waiver of this provision only when BIA determines, in its discretion, that:

        (1) The lender consistently has acted in good faith, and

        (2) The lender's failure to provide timely notice either:

        (i) Has not caused any actual or potential prejudice to BIA; or

        (ii) Was the result of the lender relying upon specific written advice from a BIA official.

        § 103.37   What must the lender do to collect payment under its loan guaranty certificate or loan insurance coverage?

#### § § 103.37

        (a) For guaranteed loans, the lender must submit a claim for its loss on a form approved by BIA.

        (1) If the lender makes an immediate claim under § 103.36(d)(1), it must send BIA the claim for loss within 90 calendar days of the default by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required). The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the date it submits the claim.

        (2) If the lender elects first to liquidate the collateral securing the loan under § 103.36(d)(2), and has a residual loss after doing so, it must send BIA the claim for loss within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the earlier of:

        (i) The date it submits the claim;

        (ii) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or

        (iii) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.

        (b) For insured loans, after liquidating all loan collateral, the lender must submit a claim for its loss (if any) on a form approved by BIA. The lender must send BIA the claim for loss by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan through the earlier of:

        (1) The date it submits the claim;

        (2) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or

        (3) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.

        (c) Whenever the lender liquidates loan collateral under § 103.36(d)(2), it must vigorously pursue all reasonable methods of collection concerning the loan collateral before submitting a claim for its residual loss (if any) to BIA. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the lender must:

        (1) Foreclose, either judicially or non-judicially, all rights of redemption the borrower or any co-maker or guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) may have in collateral under any mortgage securing the loan;

        (2) Gather and dispose of all personal property pledged as collateral under the loan, in accordance with applicable law;

        (3) Exercise all set-off rights the lender may have under contract or applicable law;

        (4) Make demand for payment on the borrower, all co-makers, and all guarantors of the loan (other than BIA); and

        (5) Participate fully in all bankruptcy proceedings that may arise involving the borrower and any co-maker or guarantor of the loan. Full participation might include, for example, filing a proof of claim in the case, attending creditors' meetings, and seeking a court order releasing the automatic stay of collection efforts so that the lender can liquidate affected loan collateral.

        (d) BIA may require further information, including without limitation copies of any documents the lender is to maintain under § 103.32 and all documentation of liquidation efforts, to help BIA evaluate the lender's claim for loss.

        (e) BIA will pay the lender the guaranteed or insured portion of the lender's claim for loss, to the extent the claim is based upon reasonably sufficient evidence of the loss and compliance with the requirements of this part. BIA will render a decision on a claim for loss within 90 days of receiving all information it requires to properly evaluate the loss.

        § 103.38   Is there anything else for BIA or the lender to do after BIA makes payment?

#### § § 103.38

        When BIA pays the lender on its claim for loss, the lender must sign and deliver to BIA an assignment of rights to its loan agreement with the borrower, in a document acceptable to BIA. Immediately upon payment, BIA is subrogated to all rights of the lender under the loan agreement with the borrower, and must pursue collection efforts against the borrower and any co-maker and guarantor, as required by law.

        § 103.39   When will BIA refuse to pay all or part of a lender's claim?

#### § § 103.39

        BIA may deny all or part of a lender's claim for loss when:

        (a) The loan is not guaranteed or insured as indicated in § 103.18;

        (b) The guarantee or insurance coverage has become invalid under §§ 103.28, 103.29, or 103.36(e);

        (c) The lender has not met the standard of care indicated in § 103.30;

        (d) The lender presents a claim for a residual loss after attempting to liquidate loan collateral, and:

        (1) The lender has not made a reasonable effort to liquidate all security for the loan;

        (2) The lender has taken an unreasonable amount of time to complete its liquidation efforts, the probable consequence of which has been to reduce overall prospects of loss recovery; or

        (3) The lender's loss claim is inflated by unreasonable liquidation expenses or unjustifiable deductions from collateral liquidation proceeds applied to the loan balance; or

        (e) The lender has otherwise failed in any material respect to follow the requirements of this part, and BIA can reasonably attribute some or all of the lender's loss to that failure.

        § 103.40   Will BIA make exceptions to its criteria for denying payment?

#### § § 103.40

        (a) BIA will not reduce or deny payment solely on the basis of §§ 103.39(c) or (e) when the lender making the claim for loss:

        (1) Is a person to whom a previous lender transferred the loan under §§ 103.28 or 103.29 before maturity for value;

        (2) Notified BIA of its acquisition of the loan interest as required by §§ 103.28 or 103.29;

        (3) Had no involvement in or knowledge of the actions or circumstances that would have allowed BIA to reduce or deny payment to a previous lender; and

        (4) Has not itself violated the standards set forth in §§ 103.39(c) or (e).

        (b) If BIA makes payment to a lender under this section, it may seek reimbursement from the previous lender or lenders who contributed to the loss by violating §§ 103.39(c) or (e).

        § 103.41   What happens if a lender violates provisions of this part?

#### § § 103.41

        In addition to reducing or eliminating payment on a specific claim for loss, BIA may either temporarily suspend, or permanently bar, a lender from making or acquiring loans under the Program if the lender repeatedly fails to abide by the requirements of this part, or if the lender significantly violates the requirements of this part on any single occasion.

        § 103.42   How long must a lender comply with Program requirements?

#### § § 103.42

        (a) A lender must comply in general with Program requirements during:

        (1) The effective period of its loan guaranty agreement or loan insurance agreement; and

        (2) Whatever additional period is necessary to resolve any outstanding loan guaranty or insurance claims or coverage the lender may have.

        (b) Except as otherwise required by law, a lender must maintain records with respect to a particular loan for 6 years after either:

        (1) The loan is repaid in full; or

        (2) The lender accepts payment from BIA for a loss on the loan, pursuant to a guaranty certificate or an insurance agreement.

        (c) At any time 2 years or more following one of the events specified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, a lender may convert its records for corresponding loans to any electronic format that is readily retrievable and that provides an accurate, detailed image of the original records. Upon converting its records in this manner, the lender may dispose of its original loan records.

        (d) This section does not restrict any claims BIA may have against the lender or any other party arising from the lender's participation in the Program.

        § 103.43   What must the lender do after repayment in full?

#### § § 103.43

        The lender must completely and promptly release of record all remaining collateral for a guaranteed or insured loan after the loan has been paid in full. The release must be at the lender's sole cost. In addition, if the loan is prepaid the lender must notify BIA in accordance with § 103.33(f).

      In making all annuity and other per capita payments, the funds shall be equally divided among the Indians entitled thereto share and share alike. The roll for such payments should be prepared on Form 5-322,   in strict alphabetical order by families of husband, wife, and unmarried dependent minor children. Unless otherwise instructed,

      (a) Indians of both sexes may be considered adults at the age of 18 years;

      (b) Deceased enrollees may be carried on the rolls for one payment after death;

      (c) Where final rolls have been prepared constituting the legal membership of the tribe, only Indians whose names appear thereon are entitled to share in future payments, after-born children being excluded and the shares of deceased enrollees paid to the heirs if determined or if not determined credited to the estate pending determination; and

      Where an Indian woman was married to a white man prior to June 7, 1897, and was at the time of her marriage a recognized member of the tribe even though she left it after marriage and lived away from the reservation, the children of such a marriage should be enrolled—and, also in the case of an Indian woman married to a white man subsequent to the above date but who still maintains her affiliation with the tribe and she and her children are recognized members thereof; however, where an Indian woman by marriage with a white man after June 7, 1897, has, in effect, withdrawn from the tribe and is no longer identified with it, her children should not be enrolled. In case of doubt all the facts should be submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C., for a decision.

      § 111.4   Election of shareholders.

#### § § 111.4

      An Indian holding equal rights in two or more tribes can share in payments to only one of them and will be required to elect with which tribe he wishes to be enrolled and to relinquish in writing his claims to payments to the other. In the case of a minor the election will be made by the parent or guardian.

      § 111.5   Future payments.

#### § § 111.5

      Indians who have received or applied for their pro rata shares of an interest-bearing tribal fund under the act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. 1221; 25 U.S.C. 119, 121), as amended by the act of May 18, 1916 (39 Stat. 128), will not be permitted to participate in future payments made from the accumulated interest.

        No, under the Trust Reform Act we are only responsible for accounting for those trust funds received into, and maintained by, the Department's trust funds management system.

        § 115.805   If a tribe is paid directly under a contract for the sale or use of trust assets, will we accept those trust funds for deposit into a tribal trust account?

#### § § 115.805

        If a contract for the sale or use of trust assets specifies that payments are to be made directly to a tribe, we will not accept these trust funds into a tribal trust account. Where a tribe under 25 U.S.C. 450f  has contracted or compacted with the federal government to operate a federal program and the tribe, operating the federal program on behalf of the Secretary, receives trust funds for the sale or use of trust assets pursuant to a contract that specifies that payments are to be made to the Secretary on behalf of a tribe or an individual [the owner of the trust assets], the tribe must follow § 115.708 for the deposit of the trust funds into the trust account.

        § 115.900   Who receives the interest earned on trust funds in a special deposit account?

#### § § 115.900

        Generally, any interest earned on trust funds in a special deposit account will follow the principal (i.e., the tribe or individual who owns the trust funds in the special deposit account will receive the interest earned).

        § 115.901   When will the trust funds in a special deposit account be credited or paid out to the owner of the funds?

#### § § 115.901

        OTFM will disburse the trust funds from a special deposit account and deposit the trust funds in the owner's trust account following the BIA certification of the ownership of the funds and OTFM's receipt of such certification.

        § 115.902   May administrative or land conveyance fees paid as federal reimbursements be deposited in a special deposit account?

#### § § 115.902

        No, administrative or land conveyance fees paid as federal reimbursements may not be deposited with OTFM, which includes special deposit accounts. These fees must be deposited in the Federal Financial System.

        § 115.903   May cash bonds (e.g., performance bonds, appeal bonds, etc.) be deposited into a special deposit account?

#### § § 115.903

#### § § 115.904

        No, any money received prior to Secretarial approval of conveyance or contract instrument involving trust assets must be deposited into a non-interest bearing, non-trust account. After the Secretary approves the conveyance or contract instrument involving trust assets, the money designated by the conveyance or contract instrument will be deposited into a trust fund account.

      Subpart I—Records

        § 115.1000   Who owns the records associated with this part?

#### § § 115.1000

        (a) Records are the property of the United States if they:

        (1) Are made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the conduct of a federal trust function under this part, including the operation of a trust program pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 450f  and

        § 115.1001   How must records associated with this part be preserved?

#### § § 115.1001

        (a) Any organization, including tribes and tribal organizations, that have records identified in § 115.1000(a) must preserve the records in accordance with approved Departmental records retention procedures under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapters 29, 31 and 33. These records and related records management practices and safeguards required under the Federal Records Act are subject to inspection by the Secretary and the Archivist of the United States.

        (b) A tribe or tribal organization should preserve the records identified in § 115.1000(b) for the period of time authorized by the Archivist of the United States for similar Department of the Interior records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33. If a tribe or tribal organization does not preserve records associated with its conduct of business with the Department of the Interior under this part, the tribe or tribal organization may be prevented from being able to adequately document essential transactions or furnish information necessary to protect its legal and financial rights or those of persons directly affected by its activities.

      § 134.1   Partial reimbursement of irrigation charges; 5 percent per annum of cost of system, June 30, 1920.

#### § § 134.1

      In pursuance of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), regulations governing partial payment of construction charges on Indian irrigation projects, with the exception of certain ones mentioned therein, where approved by the Department June 21, 1920, and require that each owner of irrigable land under any irrigation system constructed for the benefit of Indians under provisions of law requiring reimbursement of the cost of such system and to which land, water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from such system, shall pay, on or before November 15, 1920, a sum equal to 5 percent of the per acre cost, as of June 30, 1920, of the construction of the system under which such land is situated. The per acre cost of a given system as of June 30, 1920, shall be determined by dividing the total amount expended for construction purposes on such system up to that day by the total area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered on that date; and on November 15 of each year following the year 1920, until further notice, the land owners, as therein prescribed, shall pay 5 percent of the per acre construction cost as of June 30, of the current year, such per acre cost to be determined by dividing the cost of the system to June 30 of that year by the total area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from the system on that date. Provision is contained that no payments shall be required under the regulations in behalf of lands still in process of allotment or prior to the issuance of the first or trust patent therefor, nor for lands reserved for school, agency, or other administrative purposes where the legal title still remains in the United States.

      § 134.2   Landowners financially unable to pay.

#### § § 134.2

      Considerable difficulty has been encountered in collecting charges under the regulations in this part owing to the fact that Indians have been financially unable to pay the charges, the result being that the construction charges have accrued against the lands and in cases where the land is sold for the benefit of the allottee or his heirs under the regulations, the purchaser is to pay the accrued and future irrigation charges which make it difficult in some instances, to sell the land at as favorable terms as might otherwise be secured.

      § 134.3   Period for payments extended.

#### § § 134.3

      Furthermore, in recent legislation dealing with specific projects in the Bureau and also all reclamation projects the policy has been to extend the payment of such charges over a longer period of years.

      § 134.4   Annual payment reduced.

#### § § 134.4

      In view of these conditions the regulations governing this matter are hereby modified so as to distribute the unaccrued installments over a period of time so that 2  percent of the total amount yet due shall be due and payable on November 15 of each year until further notice. You shall accordingly ascertain the per acre cost after deducting the amount of the accrued charges and take 2  percent of that amount and a like sum each year so that the amount of the annual installments will be the same each year. Superintendents are obligated to submit all proposed lists of sales involving allotments containing irrigable allotments to the project or supervising engineer for checking, as to the irrigable acreage and amounts of unpaid construction, operation, and maintenance charges against such allotments. Each sale forwarded to the Bureau for action shall be accompanied by contract executed on Form 5-462b where irrigable acreage is involved and after approval thereof a copy of contract on said form shall be sent to the project engineer for his records and the charges paid by the purchaser shall be turned over to the disbursing agent for credit and deposit as instructed in the next paragraph. The regulations in this part shall not apply to lands in the Wapato project, on the Yakima Indian Reservation, nor to the irrigation projects on the Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, and Crow Reservations, Montana, for which special regulations have been issued nor to the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho, or the San Carlos project, Arizona.

      § 134.4a   Assessment and collection of additional construction costs.

#### § § 134.4a

      (a) Upon the completion of the construction of an Indian irrigation project, or unit thereof, subsequent to the determination of the partial per acre construction assessment rate which was fixed prior to July 1, 1957, pursuant to § 134.4 the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative shall determine such additional construction cost and distribute that cost on a per acre basis against all of the irrigable lands of the project, or unit thereof, and  th of such per acre additional construction cost thus determined shall be assessed and collected annually from the non-Indian landowner of the project, or unit, thereof. The first installment shall be due and payable on November 15 of the year following the completion of such additional construction work or, if such additional construction work on the project, or unit thereof, has been completed prior to July 1, 1957, and the per acre annual rate determined, the first installment of the additional construction cost to be repaid by such non-Indian landowners shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958. This annual per acre rate shall be in addition to, and run concurrently with, the per acre construction rate assessed annually under § 134.4.

      (b) Project lands in Indian ownership are not subject to assessment for their proportionate share of the per acre construction cost of the project, or unit thereof, until after the Indian title to the land has been extinguished. At that time the total annual per acre assessment rate against non-Indian lands of the project, or unit thereof, shall be assessed against the former Indian lands for each and every acre of irrigable land to which water can be delivered through the project works, beginning on November 15 of the year following the extinguishment of the Indian title to the land and on November 15 of each year thereafter over a forty year period. In cases where the Indian title to project land was extinguished prior to July 1, 1957, the assessment rate shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958.

      § 134.5   Payments to disbursing officer.

#### § § 134.5

      Payments under this part shall be made to the disbursing officer for the supervising engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service having jurisdiction over the irrigation system under which the land for which payment is made may lie. The sum so collected will then, after proper credit has been made to the land for which collected, be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the respective funds used in constructing irrigation systems toward which reimbursement shall have been made.

      § 134.6   “Owner” defined.

#### § § 134.6

      The word “owner” as used in this part shall be construed to include any person, Indian or white, or any firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization to whom title to the land capable of irrigation, as provided in the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), has passed, either by fee or trust patent, or otherwise.

      § 134.7   Modifications.

#### § § 134.7

      The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a), cancelled all irrigation assessments for construction costs against lands in Indian ownership which were unpaid at that date and deferred all future assessments for construction costs until the Indian title to the land shall have been extinguished.

      § 136.1   Repayment contracts.

#### § § 136.1

      A rehabilitation program was established on the Fort Hall Unit of the Fort Hall Project in 1936. Based upon the estimated construction costs, contracts were signed by all non-Indian landowners within the project, including such landowners within the Little Indian Unit, now a part of the Fort Hall Unit. Under the terms of their contracts, the landowners agreed to repay to the Government their pro rata share, on an acreage basis, of all expenditures for construction and other necessary improvements for carrying out the approved program, payments not to exceed $7.50 per acre, based upon an estimated expenditure of $450,000.00 for a project then considered as covering approximately 60,000 acres.

      § 136.2   Construction costs.

#### § § 136.2

      The program of rehabilitation has now been completed at a cost of $419,186.52. This amount, chargeable on an equal per acre basis against 60,000 acres, amounts to a rate of $6.986 per acre, which rate is hereby determined to be the per acre cost to be repaid to the United States under the 1936 contracts.

      § 136.3   Repayment of construction costs.

#### § § 136.3

      Under the terms of the contracts, the landowners agreed to repay the construction cost in forty (40) equal annual installments. Therefore, the annual per acre installment is hereby fixed at seventeen and one-half cents (17  cents) per acre, due and payable on December 1st of each year, the first payment being due on December 1, 1955. Under section 4 of the repayment contracts of the landowners and the act of March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210), the charges remain a lien against the lands until paid.

      The engineering report dealt with in section 1 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475) and other available records show that the storage capacity of the San Carlos reservoir created by the Coolidge Dam and the water supply therefor over a period of years will provide for the irrigation of only 80,000 acres of lands in Indian and public or private ownership within the San Carlos irrigation project, the balance of the water supply needed for the additional 20,000 acres of the project to be provided for by recaptured and return flow water and by means of pumping the underground supply. The cost of providing the proposed supply and of operating the works for this latter acreage to be equally distributed over the entire 100,000 acres of the project regardless of where the works are placed and operated.

      § 137.2   Availability of water.

#### § § 137.2

      Pursuant to section 3 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475), requiring the Secretary of the Interior by public notice to announce when water is actually available for lands in private ownership under the project and the amount of the construction charges per irrigable acre against the same which charges shall be payable in annual installments as provided for therein, this public notice, of which § 137.1 is made a part hereof, is hereby given:

      The date when a reasonable water supply is actually available for lands in private ownership under the San Carlos irrigation project is hereby declared to be the 1st day of December 1932.

      § 137.3   Construction charges.

#### § § 137.3

      Each acre of land in private ownership of said project is hereby charged with $95.25 of construction cost assessable thereto at the date hereof (Dec. 1, 1932), which sum is based upon 50,000 acres of such privately owned lands, making a total charge or assessment due from the owners thereof of $4,762,250 on this date (Dec. 1, 1932), excluding the cost of operation and maintenance for the calendar year of 1933 which may be carried into construction cost as provided for by section 3 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), and also excluding interest at the rate of 4 percent which is charged against such lands by said act. Of the 50,000 acres constituting the lands in private ownership within the said project only 46,107.49 acres have at this date (Dec. 1, 1932) actually been designated as coming within the project. Should this present designated area be not increased within a reasonable time herefrom and prior to the due date of the first installment of the charge fixed in this section, namely, on December 1, 1935, so as to bring the total designated area up to the 50,000 acres, the per acre charge fixed in this section shall be proportionately increased against the then designated area so as to assure reimbursement of the total indebtedness due the Government by the owners of the lands in private ownership from the lesser designated acreage.

      § 137.4   Future charges.

#### § § 137.4

      The payment of said construction cost and costs of future operation and maintenance of said project as provided for in said section 3 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), as supplemented or amended and such contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with the provisions of said repayment contract shall be made in accordance with the provisions of said act of June 7, 1924, as supplemented or amended and the repayment contract by and between the San Carlos irrigation and drainage district and the Secretary of the Interior bearing date of June 8, 1931; the said construction cost incurred subsequent to this public notice assessable against the lands in private ownership and costs of operation and maintenance assessed against such privately owned lands within the project for the first year after this public notice to be included in the construction cost and such contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with provisions of the repayment contract shall also be repaid to the Government pursuant to the terms of said act of June 7, 1924, as supplemented or amended, and the repayment contract and this public notice.

      § 137.5   Construction costs limited.

      § 137.6   Power development.

#### § § 137.6

      The cost of the power development at the Coolidge Dam is hereby fixed at $735,000. The net revenues derived from the operation of this power development shall be disposed of as required by the terms and conditions of the act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210) as supplemented or amended.

      § 137.7   Private ownership defined.

#### § § 137.7

      The term “private ownership” used in this public notice includes all lands of the San Carlos irrigation project that have or may be designated by the Secretary of the Interior that are situated outside of the boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation.

      § 137.8   Indian lands excluded.

#### § § 137.8

      This public notice, with the exception of that part dealing with payment in advance each year of operation and maintenance charges against lands in Indian ownership operated under lease, does not apply in so far as payments are concerned to Indian lands within the project. The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a) defers the collection of construction costs from Indian owned lands so long as the title to such lands remains in the Indian ownership.

      § 151.1   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 151.1

      This part sets forth the authorities, policies, and procedures governing the acquisition of land by the United States in trust status for individual Indians and Tribes. This part does not cover acquisition of land by individual Indians and Tribes in fee simple status even though such land may, by operation of law, be held in restricted status following acquisition; acquisition of land mandated by Federal law; acquisition of land in trust status by inheritance or escheat; or transfers of land into restricted fee status unless required by Federal law.

      § 151.2   How are key terms defined?

#### § § 151.2

      means two parcels of land having a common boundary notwithstanding the existence of non-navigable waters or a public road or right-of-way and includes parcels that touch at a point.

      means an interest in land that is owned in unrestricted fee simple status and is, thus, freely alienable by the fee owner.

      means a tract of Indian land owned in common by Indian landowners and/or fee owners holding undivided interests therein.

      means any tract in which any interest is held by a Tribe or individual Indian in trust or restricted status and includes both individually owned _Indian land_ and Tribal land.

      means a Tribe or individual Indian who owns an interest in Indian land.

      or  means, unless another definition is required by Federal law authorizing a particular trust acquisition, that area of land over which the Tribe is recognized by the United States as having governmental jurisdiction, except that, in the State of Oklahoma wherever historic reservations have not yet been reaffirmed, or where there has been a final judicial determination that a reservation has been disestablished or diminished,  means that area of land constituting the former reservation of the Tribe as defined by the Secretary.

      means:

      (1) Any person who is an enrolled member of a Tribe;

      (2) Any person who is a descendent of such a member and said descendant was, on June 1, 1934, physically residing on a federally recognized Indian reservation; or

      (3) Any other person possessing a total of one-half or more degree Indian blood of a Tribe.

      means an acquisition of land in trust status for the benefit of a Tribe that currently has no land held in trust status.

      means a person or other entity whose legally protected interests would be affected by a decision.

      means real property or any interest therein.

      means title that a reasonable buyer would accept because it appears to lack substantial defect and that covers the entire property that the seller has purported to sell.

      means an opinion issued by the Office of the Solicitor that reviews the existing status of title, examining both record and non-record title evidence and any encumbrances or liens against the land, and sets forth requirements to be met before acquiring land in trust status.

      means a report prepared by a title company prior to issuing a policy of title insurance that shows the ownership of a specific parcel of land together with the liens and encumbrances thereon.

      or  means land the title to which is held by an individual Indian or a Tribe and which can only be alienated or encumbered by the owner with the approval of the Secretary due to limitations contained in the conveyance instrument pursuant to Federal law or because a Federal law directly imposes such limitations.

      means the _Secretary_ of the Interior or authorized representative.

      means any Indian __Tribe__ listed under section 102 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 5130). For purposes of acquisitions made under the authority of 25 U.S.C. 5136 and 5138, or other statutory authority which specifically authorizes trust acquisitions for such corporations,  also means a corporation chartered under section 17 of the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 5124) or section 3 of the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967; 25 U.S.C. 5203).

      or  means land the title to which is held in trust by the United States for an individual Indian or a Tribe.

      means a fractional share of ownership in an estate of Indian land where the estate is owned in common with other Indian landowners or fee owners.

      § 151.3   What is the Secretary's land acquisition policy?

#### § § 151.3

      (a) It is the Secretary's policy to acquire land in trust status through direct acquisition or transfer for individual Indians and Tribes to strengthen self-determination and sovereignty, ensure that every Tribe has protected homelands where its citizens can maintain their Tribal existence and way of life, and consolidate land ownership to strengthen Tribal governance over reservation lands and reduce checkerboarding. The Secretary retains discretion whether to acquire land in trust status where discretion is granted under Federal law. Land not held in trust or restricted status may only be acquired for an individual Indian or a Tribe in trust status when the acquisition is authorized by Federal law. No acquisition of land in trust status under these regulations, including a transfer of land already held in trust or restricted status, shall be valid unless the acquisition is approved by the Secretary.

      (b) Subject to the provisions of Federal law authorizing trust land acquisitions, the Secretary may acquire land for a Tribe in trust status:

      (1) When the land is located within the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's reservation or contiguous thereto;

      (2) When the Tribe already owns an interest in the land; or

      (3) When the Secretary determines that the acquisition of the land will further Tribal interests by establishing a Tribal land base or protecting Tribal homelands, protecting sacred sites or cultural resources and practices, establishing or maintaining conservation or environmental mitigation areas, consolidating land ownership, reducing checkerboarding, acquiring land lost through allotment, protecting treaty or subsistence rights, or facilitating Tribal self-determination, economic development, Indian housing, or for other reasons the Secretary determines will support Tribal welfare.

      (c) Subject to the provisions contained in Federal law which authorize land acquisitions or holding land in trust or restricted status, the Secretary may acquire land in trust status for an individual Indian:

      (1) When the land is located within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation, or contiguous thereto; or

      (2) When the land is already in trust or restricted status.

      § 151.4   How will the Secretary determine that statutory authority exists to acquire land in trust status?

#### § § 151.4

      When a Tribe's application relies on the first definition of “Indian” in the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 5101 ) (IRA) to establish statutory authority for the proposed acquisition, the Secretary will apply the following criteria to determine whether the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

      (a) In determining whether a Tribe was “under Federal jurisdiction” in 1934 within the meaning of section 19 of the IRA (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 5129), the Secretary shall consider evidence of Federal jurisdiction in the manner provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

      (1) Conclusive evidence establishes in and of itself both that a Tribe was placed under Federal jurisdiction and that this jurisdiction remained intact in 1934. If such evidence exists, no further analysis under this section is needed. The following is conclusive evidence that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934:

      (i) A vote under section 18 of the IRA (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 5125) to accept or reject the IRA as recorded in  Theodore Haas, United States Indian Service (Jan. 1947) (Haas List) or other Federal government document;

      (ii) Land held in trust by the United States for the Tribe in 1934.

      (iii) Secretarial approval of a Tribal constitution under section 16 of the IRA as recorded in the Haas List or other Federal Government document;

      (iv) Secretarial approval of a charter of incorporation issued to a Tribe under section 17 of the IRA as recorded in the Haas List or other Federal Government document;

      (v) An Executive Order for a specific Tribe that was still in effect in 1934;

      (vi) Treaties to which a Tribe is a party, ratified by the United States and still in effect as to that party in 1934;

      (vii) Continuing existence in 1934 or later of treaty rights guaranteed by a treaty ratified by the United States; or

      (viii) Other evidence that the Secretary determines is conclusive in a particular case.

      (2) Presumptive evidence is indicative that a Tribe was placed under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934 and may indicate that such jurisdiction remained intact in 1934. In the absence of evidence indicating that Federal jurisdiction did not exist or did not exist in 1934, presumptive evidence satisfies the analysis under this section. The following is presumptive evidence that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934:

      (i) Evidence of treaty negotiations or evidence a Tribe signed a treaty with the United States whether or not such treaty was ratified by Congress;

      (ii) Listing of a Tribe in the Department of the Interior's 1934 Indian Population Report;

      (iii) Evidence that the United States took efforts to acquire lands on behalf of a Tribe in the years leading up to the passage of the IRA;

      (iv) Inclusion in Volume V of Charles J. Kappler's

      (v) Federal legislation for a specific Tribe, including land claim settlements and termination legislation enacted after 1934, which acknowledges the existence of a government-to-government relationship with a Tribe in or before 1934; or

      (vi) Satisfaction of the criterion for Federal acknowledgment now located at 25 CFR 83.11(a) and previously located at 25 CFR 83.7(a), requiring that a Tribe “has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis,” through evidence that brought the Tribe under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934; or

      (vii) Other evidence that the Secretary determines is presumptive in a particular case.

      (3) In the absence of evidence identified above as conclusive or presumptive evidence, the Secretary may find that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 when the United States in 1934 or at some point in the Tribe's history prior to 1934, took an action or series of actions that, when viewed in concert through a course of dealings or other relevant acts on behalf of a Tribe, or in some instances Tribal members, establishes or generally reflects Federal obligations, or duties, responsibility for or authority over the Tribe, and that such jurisdictional status remained intact in 1934.

      (i) Examples of Federal actions that exhibit probative evidence of Federal jurisdiction may include but are not limited to, the Department's acquisition of land for a Tribe in implementing the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, efforts by the Federal Government to conduct a vote under section 18 of the IRA to accept or reject the IRA where no vote was held, the attendance of Tribal members at Bureau of Indian Affairs operated schools, Federal decisions regarding whether to remove or not remove a Tribe from its homelands, the inclusion of a Tribe in Federal reports and surveys, the inclusion of a Tribe or Tribal members in Federal census records prepared by the Office of Indian Affairs, the approval of contracts between a Tribe and non-Indians; enforcement of the Trade and Intercourse Acts (Indian trader, liquor laws, and land transactions), and the provision of health and social services to a Tribe or Tribal members.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (4) When a Tribe is recognized under the 25 CFR part 83 process, the Secretary may rely on any evidence within the part 83 record that the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934, consistent with § 151.4(a)(2) and (3).

      (5) Evidence of executive officials disavowing Federal jurisdiction over a Tribe in certain instances is not conclusive evidence of a Tribe's Federal jurisdictional status. This is because such disavowals cannot themselves revoke Federal jurisdiction over a Tribe.

      (b) For some Tribes, Congress enacted legislation after 1934 making the IRA applicable to the Tribe. The existence of such legislation making the IRA and its trust acquisition provisions applicable to a Tribe eliminates the need to determine whether a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

      (c) In order to be eligible for trust acquisitions under section 5 of the IRA, no additional “under Federal jurisdiction” analysis is required under this part for Tribes for which the Department has previously issued an analysis finding the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction.

      (d) Land may be acquired in trust status for an individual Indian or a Tribe in the State of Oklahoma under section 5 of the IRA if the acquisition comes within the terms of this part. This authority is in addition to all other statutory authority for such an acquisition.

      (e) The Secretary may also acquire land in trust status for an individual Indian or a Tribe under this part when specifically authorized by Federal law other than section 5 of the IRA, subject to any limitations contained in that Federal law.

      § 151.5   May the Secretary acquire land in trust status by exchange?

#### § § 151.5

      The Secretary may acquire land in trust status on behalf of an individual Indian or Tribe by exchange under this part if authorized by Federal law and within the terms of this part. The disposal aspects of an exchange are governed by part 152 of this title.

      § 151.6   May the Secretary approve acquisition of a fractional interest?

#### § § 151.6

      Where the mandatory acquisition process provided under 25 U.S.C. 2216(c) is not applicable to a fractional interest acquisition,  where the acquisition proposed is off-reservation, the following section applies to discretionary acquisitions of fractional interests. The Secretary may approve the acquisition of a fractional interest in a fractionated tract in trust status by an individual Indian or a Tribe including when:

      (a) The applicant already owns a fractional interest in the same parcel of land;

      (b) The interest being acquired by the applicant is in fee status;

      (c) The applicant offers to purchase the remaining undivided trust or restricted interests in the parcel at not less than their fair market value;

      (d) There is a specific law which grants to the applicant the right to purchase an undivided interest or interests in trust or restricted land without offering to purchase all such interests; or

      (e) The owner or owners of more than fifty percent of the remaining trust or restricted interests in the parcel consent in writing to the acquisition by the applicant.

      § 151.7   Is Tribal consent required for nonmember acquisitions?

#### § § 151.7

      An individual Indian or Tribe may acquire land in trust status on an Indian reservation other than its own only when the governing body of the Tribe having jurisdiction over such reservation consents in writing to the acquisition; provided, that such consent shall not be required if the individual Indian or the Tribe already owns an undivided trust or restricted interest in the parcel of land to be acquired.

      § 151.8   What documentation is included in a trust acquisition package?

#### § § 151.8

      An individual Indian or Tribe seeking to acquire land in trust status must file a written request,  application, with the Secretary. The request need not be in any special form but must set out the identity of the parties, a description of the land to be acquired, and other information which would show that the acquisition fulfills the requirements of this part. The Secretary will prepare the acquisition package using information provided by the applicant and analysis developed by the Secretary, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this section:

      (a) A complete acquisition package consists of the following:

      (1) The applicant must submit a request that the land be acquired in trust, as follows:

      (i) If the applicant is an Indian Tribe, the Tribe's written request must be a signed Tribal letter for trust acquisition supported by a Tribal resolution or other act of the governing body of the Tribe;

      (ii) If the applicant is an individual Indian, the individual's written request must be a signed letter requesting trust status;

      (2) The applicant must submit documentation providing the information evaluated by the Secretary under § 151.9(a)(2) and (3), § 151.10(a)(2) and (3), § 151.11(a)(2) and (3), or § 151.12(a)(2) and (3) depending on which section applies to the application;

      (3) The applicant must submit a statement identifying the existence of statutory authority for the acquisition including, if applicable, any supporting evidence that the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 pursuant to § 151.4.

      (4) The applicant must submit a description of the land as follows:

      (i) An aliquot part, government lot, parcel identified on a Government Land Office or Bureau of Land Management official survey plat, or lot block subdivision (LBS) legal description of the land and a map from the applicant, including a statement of the estate to be acquired,  all surface and mineral rights, surface rights only, surface rights and a portion of the mineral rights, etc.; or

      (ii) A metes and bounds land description and survey if the land cannot be described by the methods listed in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, including a statement of the estate to be acquired. The survey may be completed by a land surveyor registered in the jurisdiction in which the land is located when the land being acquired is fee simple land; and

      (iii) An application package is not complete until the Secretary determines that the legal description or survey is sufficient.

      (5) The applicant must submit information that allows the Secretary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 602 DM 2, Land Acquisitions: Hazardous Substances Determinations pursuant to § 151.15; and

      (i) An acquisition package is not complete until the public review period of a final environmental impact statement or, where appropriate, the final environmental assessment has concluded, or the categorical exclusion documentation is complete.

      (ii) An acquisition package is not complete until a pre-acquisition Phase I environmental site assessment, and if necessary, a Phase II environmental site assessment completed pursuant to 602 DM 2 is determined to be sufficient by the Secretary.

      (6) The applicant must submit title evidence pursuant to § 151.14.

      (i) An acquisition package is not complete until the Secretary completes a Preliminary Title Opinion based on such evidence;

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (8) The applicant must submit a statement that any existing covenants, easements, or restrictions of record will not interfere with the applicant's intended use of the land; and

      (9) The applicant must submit any additional information or action requested by the Secretary, in writing, if warranted by the specific application.

      (b) After the Bureau of Indian Affairs is in possession of a complete acquisition package, the Secretary shall:

      (1) Notify the applicant within 30 calendar days in writing that the acquisition package is complete; and

      (2) Issue a decision on a request within 120 calendar days after issuance of the notice of a complete acquisition package.

      § 151.9   How will the Secretary evaluate a request involving land within the boundaries of an Indian reservation?

#### § § 151.9

      (a) The Secretary shall consider the criteria in this section when evaluating requests for the acquisition of land in trust status when the land is located within the boundaries of an Indian reservation.

      (1) The existence of statutory authority for the acquisition and any limitations contained in such authority;

      (2) If the applicant is an individual Indian, the need for additional land, the amount of trust or restricted land already owned by or for that individual, and the degree to which the individual needs assistance in handling their affairs;

      (3) The purposes for which the land will be used; and

      (4) If the land to be acquired is in fee status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs is equipped to discharge the additional responsibilities resulting from the acquisition of the land in trust status.

      (b) The Secretary shall give great weight to acquiring land that serves any of the following purposes, in accordance with § 151.3:

      (1) Furthers Tribal interests by establishing a Tribal land base or protects Tribal homelands;

      (2) Protects sacred sites or cultural resources and practices;

      (3) Establishes or maintains conservation or environmental mitigation areas;

      (4) Consolidates land ownership;

      (5) Reduces checkerboarding;

      (8) Facilitates Tribal self-determination, economic development, or Indian housing.

      (c) When reviewing a Tribe's request for land within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, the Secretary presumes that the acquisition will further the Tribal interests described in paragraph (b) of this section, and adverse impacts to local governments' regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes, and special assessments will be minimal, therefore the application should be approved.

      (d) Upon receipt of a written request to have land acquired in trust within the boundaries of an Indian reservation the Secretary shall notify the State and local governments with regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired of the applicant's request. The notice will inform the State or local government that each will be given 30 calendar days in which to provide written comments to rebut the presumption of minimal adverse impacts to regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes, and special assessments. If the State or local government responds within 30 calendar days, a copy of the comments will be provided to the applicant, who will be given a reasonable time in which to reply, if they choose to do so in their discretion, or request that the Secretary issue a decision.

The timely initiation of proceedings in the State district court will stay the effective date of the order removing restrictions until such proceedings are concluded. If the State district court dismisses the appeal, the order removing restrictions will become effective 6 months after notification to the parties of such dismissal. The effect of the issuance of such order will be as prescribed in § 152.16.

        § 152.23   Applications for sale, exchange or gift.

        § 152.24   Appraisal.

#### § § 152.24

        (a)  Indian owners may, with the approval of the Secretary, negotiate a sale of and sell trust or restricted land for not less than the appraised fair market value:

        (1) When the sale is to the United States, States, or political subdivisions thereof, or such other sale as may be for a public purpose;

        (2) When the sale is to the tribe or another Indian; or

        (3) When the Secretary determines it is impractical to advertise.

        (b)  With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may exchange trust or restricted land, or a combination of such land and other things of value, for other lands or combinations of land and other things of value. The value of the consideration received by the Indian in the exchange must be at least substantially equal to the appraised fair market value of the consideration given by him.

        (c)  With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may negotiate a sale of and sell trust or restricted land to a coowner of that land. The consideration may be less than the appraised fair market value, if in the opinion of the Secretary there is a special relationship between the coowners or special circumstances exist.

        (d)  With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may convey trust or restricted land, for less than the appraised fair market value or for no consideration when the prospective grantee is the owner's spouse, brother, sister, lineal ancestor of Indian blood or lineal descendant, or when some other special relationship exists between the grantor and grantee or special circumstances exist that in the opinion of the Secretary warrant the approval of the conveyance.

        § 152.26   Advertisement.

#### § § 152.26

        (a) Upon approval of an application for an advertised sale, notice of the sale will be published not less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the sale unless for good cause a shorter period is authorized by the Secretary.

        (2) Where and how bids shall be submitted;

        (3) A statement warning all bidders against violation of 18 U.S.C. 1860 prohibiting unlawful combination or intimidation of bidders or potential bidders; and

        (4) Description of tracts, all reservations to which title will be subject and any restrictions and encumbrances of record with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and any other information that may improve sale prospects.

        § 152.27   Procedure of sale.

#### § § 152.27

        Advertised sales shall be by sealed bids except as otherwise provided herein.

        (a)(1) Bids, conforming to the requirements set out in the advertisement of sale, along with a certified check, cashier's check, money order, or U.S. Treasury check, payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for not less than 10 percent of the amount of the bid, must be enclosed in a sealed envelope marked as prescribed in the notice of sale. A cash deposit may be submitted in lieu of the above-specified negotiable instruments at the bidder's risk. Tribes submitting bids pursuant to this paragraph may guarantee the required 10 percent deposit by an appropriate resolution;

        (2) The sealed envelopes containing the bids will be publicly opened at the time fixed for sale. The bids will be announced and will be appropriately recorded.

        (b) The policy of the Secretary recognizes that in many instances a tribe or a member thereof has a valid interest in acquiring trust or restricted lands offered for sale.

        (1) With the consent of the owner and when the notice of sale so states, the tribe or members of such tribe shall have the right to meet the high bid.

        (2) Provided the tribe is not the high bidder and when one or more acceptable sealed bids are received and when so stated in the notice of sale, an oral auction may be held following the bid opening. Bidding in the auction will be limited to the tribe, and to those who submitted sealed bids at 75 percent or more of the appraised value of the land being auctioned. At the conclusion of the auction the highest bidder must increase his deposit to not less than 10 percent of his auction bid.

        § 152.28   Action at close of bidding.

#### § § 152.28

        (a) The officer in charge of the sale shall publicly announce the apparent highest acceptable bid. The deposits submitted by the unsuccessful bidders shall be returned immediately. The deposit submitted by the apparent successful bidder shall be held in a special account.

        (b) If the highest bid received at an advertised sale is less than the appraised fair market value of the land, the Secretary with the consent of the owner may accept that bid if the amount bid approximates said appraised fair market value and in the Secretary's judgment is the highest price that may be realized in the circumstances.

        (c) The Secretary shall award the bid and notify the apparent successful bidder that the remainder of the purchase price must be submitted within 30 days.

        (1) Upon a showing of cause the Secretary may, in his discretion, extend the time of payment of the balance due.

        (2) If the remainder of the purchase price is not paid within the time allowed, the bid will be rejected and the apparent successful bidder's 10 percent deposit will be forfeited to the landowner's use.

        (d) The issuance of the patent or delivery of a deed to the purchaser will not be authorized until the balance of the purchase price has been paid, except that the fee patent may be ordered in cases where the purchaser is obtaining a loan from an agency of the Federal Government and such agency has given the Secretary a commitment that the balance of the purchase price will be paid when the fee patent is issued.

        § 152.29   Rejection of bids; disapproval of sale.

#### § § 152.29

        The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all bids before the award, after the award, or at any time prior to the issuance of a patent or delivery of a deed, when he shall have determined such rejection to be in the best interests of the Indian owner.

        § 152.30   Bidding by employees.

#### § § 152.30

        Except as authorized by the provisions of part 140 of this chapter, no person employed in Indian Affairs shall directly or indirectly bid, make, or prepare any bid, or assist any bidder in preparing his bid. Sales between Indians, either of whom is an employee of the U.S. Government, are governed by the provisions of part 140 of this chapter (see 25 U.S.C. 68 and 441).

        § 152.31   Cost of conveyance; payment.

#### § § 152.31

        Pursuant to the Act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 415), as amended by the Act of March 1, 1933 (47 Stat. 1417; 25 U.S.C. 413), the Secretary may in his discretion collect from a purchaser reasonable fees for work performed or expense incurred in the transaction. The amount so collected shall be deposited to the credit of the United States as general fund receipts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (a)(1) The amount of the fee shall be $22.50 for each transaction.

        (2) The fee may be reduced to a lesser amount or may be waived, if the Secretary determines circumstances justify such action.

        

        (b)(1) If any or all of the costs of the work performed or expenses incurred are paid with tribal funds, an alternate schedule of fees may be established, subject to approval of the Secretary, and that part of such fees deemed appropriate may be credited to the tribe.

        (2) When the purchaser is the tribe which bears all or any part of such costs, the collection of the proportionate share from the tribe may be waived.

        § 152.32   Irrigation fee; payment.

#### § § 152.32

        Collection of all construction costs against any Indian-owned lands within Indian irrigation projects is deferred as long as Indian title has not been extinguished. (Act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a)). This statute is interpreted to apply only where such land is owned by Indians either in trust or restricted status.

        (a) When any person whether Indian or non-Indian acquires Indian lands in a fee simple status that are part of an Indian irrigation project he must enter into an agreement,

        (1) To pay the pro rata share of the construction of the project chargeable to the land,

        (2) To pay all construction costs that accrue in the future, and

        (3) To pay all future charges assessable to the land which are based on the annual cost of operation and maintenance of the irrigation system.

        (b) Any operation and maintenance charges that are delinquent when Indian land is sold will be deducted from the proceeds of sale unless other acceptable arrangements are made to provide for their payment prior to the approval of the sale.

        (c) A lien clause covering all unpaid irrigation construction costs, past and future, will be inserted in the patent or other instrument of conveyance issued to all purchasers of restricted or trust lands that are under an Indian irrigation project.

      Partitions in Kind of Inherited Allotments

        § 152.33   Partition.

#### § § 152.33

        (a)  If the Secretary of the Interior shall find that any inherited trust allotment or allotments (as distinguished from lands held in a restricted fee status or authorized to be sold under the Act of May 14, 1948 (62 Stat. 236; 25 U.S.C. 483)), are capable of partition in kind to the advantage of the heirs, he may cause such lands to be partitioned among them, regardless of their competency, patents in fee to be issued to the competent heirs for their shares and trust patents to be issued to the incompetent heirs for the lands respectively or jointly set apart to them, the trust period to terminate in accordance with the terms of the original patent or order of extension of the trust period set out in said patent. (Act of May 18, 1916 (39 Stat. 127; 25 U.S.C. 378)). The authority contained in the Act of May 18, 1916, is not applicable to lands authorized to be sold by the Act of May 14, 1948, nor to land held in restricted fee status.

        (b)  Heirs of a deceased allottee may make written application, in the form approved by the Secretary, for partition of their trust or restricted land. If the Secretary finds the trust lands susceptible of partition, he may issue new patents or deeds to the heirs for the portions set aside to them. If the allotment is held under a restricted fee title (as distinguished from a trust title), partition may be accomplished by the heirs executing deeds approved by the Secretary, to the other heirs for their respective portions.

      Mortgages and Deeds of Trust To Secure Loans to Indians

        § 152.34   Approval of mortgages and deeds of trust.

#### § § 152.34

        Any individual Indian owner of trust or restricted lands, may with the approval of the Secretary execute a mortgage or deed of trust to his land. Prior to approval of such mortgage or deed of trust, the Secretary shall secure appraisal information as he deems advisable. Such lands shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of the mortgage or deed of trust in accordance with the laws of the State in which the lands are located. For the purpose of foreclosure or sale proceedings under this section, the Indian owners shall be regarded as vested with unrestricted fee simple title to the lands (Act of March 29, 1956).

        § 152.35   Deferred payment sales.

#### § § 152.35

        When the Indian owner and purchaser desire, a sale may be made or approved on the deferred payment plan. The terms of the sale will be incorporated in a memorandum of sale which shall constitute a contract for delivery of title upon payment in full of the amount of the agreed consideration. The deed executed by the grantor or grantors will be held by the Superintendent and will be delivered only upon full compliance with the terms of sale. If conveyance of title is to be made by fee patent, request therefor will be made only upon full compliance with the terms of the sale. The terms of the sale shall require that the purchaser pay not less than 10 percent of the purchase price in advance as required by the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 855), as amended (25 U.S.C. 372); terms for the payment of the remaining installments plus interest shall be those acceptable to the Secretary and the Indian owner. If the purchaser on any deferred payment plan makes default in the first or subsequent payments, all payments, including interest, previously made will be forfeited to the Indian owner.

      § 152.2   Withholding action on application.

#### § § 152.2

      Action on any application, which if approved would remove Indian land from restricted or trust status, may be withheld, if the Secretary determines that such removal would adversely affect the best interest of other Indians, or the tribes, until the other Indians or the tribes so affected have had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the land from the applicant. If action on the application is to be withheld, the applicant shall be advised that he has the right to appeal the withholding action pursuant to the provisions of part 2 of this chapter.

      § 158.53   Order to change designation of homestead.

#### § § 158.53

      The application of an Osage allottee, or his legal guardian, may be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized representative, and an order issued to change designation of homestead, if it is found that the applicant owns an equal area of surplus land.

      § 160.1   Liens.

#### § § 160.1

      The act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210; 25 U.S.C. 387) creates a first lien against irrigable lands under all Indian irrigation projects where the construction, operation and maintenance costs of such projects remain unpaid and are reimbursable, and directs that such lien shall be recited in any patent or instrument issued for such lands to cover such unpaid charges. Prior to the enactment of this legislation similar liens had been created by legislative authority against irrigable lands of the projects on the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and Gila River Reservations, in Arizona; Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, Fort Belknap, and Crow Reservations, Mont.; Wapato project, Yakima Reservation, Wash.; the irrigable lands on the Colville Reservation within the West Okanogan irrigation district, Washington, and the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho. This legislation, therefore, extends protection similar to that existing in the legislation applicable to the projects on the reservations above mentioned.

      § 160.2   Instructions.

#### § § 160.2

      All superintendents and other officers are directed to familiarize themselves with this provision of law, and in all cases involving the issuance of patents or deeds direct to the Indian or purchaser of Indian allotments embracing irrigable lands, they will recite in the papers forwarded to the Department for action the fact that the lands involved are within an irrigation project (giving the name) and accordingly are subject to the provisions of this law. This requirement will be in addition to the existing regulations requiring the superintendents in case of sales of irrigable lands to obtain from the project engineer a written statement relative to the irrigability of the lands to be sold, and whether or not there are any unpaid irrigation charges, together with the estimated per acre construction cost assessable against the land involved in the sale. Each sale will also be accompanied by contract executed in accordance with regulations obligating the purchaser to pay the accrued charges, namely, construction, operation, and maintenance, prior to the approval of the sale and to assume and pay the unassessed irrigation charges in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.

      § 160.3   Leases to include description of lands.

#### § § 160.3

      It is important, also, for superintendents in leasing irrigable lands to present to the project engineer lists containing descriptions of the lands involved for his approval of the irrigable acreage and for checking as to whether or not such lands are in fact irrigable under existing works. Strict compliance with this section is required for the purpose of avoiding error.

      § 160.4   Prompt payment of irrigation charges by lessees.

#### § § 160.4

      Superintendents will also see that irrigation charges are promptly paid by lessees, and where such charges are not so paid take appropriate and prompt action for their collection. Such unpaid charges are a lien against the land, and accordingly any failure on the part of the superintendents to collect same increases the obligation against the land.

#### § § 161.400

        (a) The Navajo Nation may prescribe eligibility requirements for grazing allocations within 180 days following the effective date of this part. BIA will prescribe the eligibility requirements after expiration of the 180-day period if the Navajo Nation does not prescribe eligibility requirements, or if satisfactory action is not taken by the Navajo Nation.

        (b) With the written concurrence of the Navajo Nation, BIA will prescribe the following eligibility requirements, where only those applicants who meet the following criteria are eligible to receive permits to graze livestock:

        (1) Those who had grazing permits on Navajo Partitioned Lands under 25 CFR part 167 (formerly part 152), and whose permits were canceled on October 14, 1973;

        (b) The Navajo Nation must inform BIA if it grants any permits under paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 161.402   What are the procedures for reissuing permits?

#### § § 161.402

        BIA, with the concurrence of the Navajo Nation, will reissue grazing permits only to individuals that meet the eligibility requirements in § 161.400. Responsibilities for reissuance of grazing permits are as follows:

        (a) BIA will develop a complete list consisting of all former permittees whose permits were cancelled and the number of animal units previously authorized in prior grazing permits. This list will be provided to the Grazing Committee and Resources Committee for their review. BIA will also provide the Grazing Committee and Resources Committee with the current carrying capacity and stocking rate for each range unit within the Navajo Partitioned Lands, as determined under § 161.204.

        (b) Within 90 days of receipt, the Grazing Committee will review the list developed under § 161.402(a), and make recommendations to the Resources Committee for the granting of grazing permits according to the eligibility and priority criteria in § 161.400.

        (c) If the Grazing Committee fails to make its recommendation to the Resources Committee within 90 days after receiving the list of potential permittees, BIA will submit its recommendations to the Resources Committee.

        (d) The Resources Committee will review and concur with the list of proposed permit grantees, and then forward a final list to BIA for the reissuance of grazing permits. If the Resources Committee does not concur, the procedures outlined in § 161.800 will govern.

        (e) The final determination list of eligible permittees will be published. Permits will not be issued sooner than 90 days following publication of the final list.

        § 161.403   How are grazing permits allocated within each range unit?

#### § § 161.403

        (a) Initial allocation of the number of animal units authorized in each grazing permit will be determined by considering the number of animal units previously authorized in prior grazing permits and the current authorized stocking rate on a given range unit.

        (b) Grazing permit allocations may vary from range unit to range unit depending on the stocking rate of each unit, the range management plan, and the number of eligible grazing permittees in the unit.

      Subpart F—Modifying A Permit

        § 161.500   May permits be transferred, assigned or modified?

#### § § 161.500

        (a) Grazing permits may be transferred, assigned, or modified only as provided in this section. Permits may only be transferred or assigned as a single permit under Navajo Nation procedures and with the approval of BIA. Permittees must reside within the same range unit as the original permittee.

        (b) Permits may be transferred, assigned, or modified with the written consent of the permittee, District Grazing Committee and/or Resources Committee and approved by BIA.

        (c) BIA must record each transfer, assignment, or modification that it approves under a permit.

        § 161.502   Will a special land use require permit modification?

#### § § 161.502

        Yes. When the Navajo Nation and BIA approve a special land use, the grazing permit will be modified to reflect the change in available forage. If a special land use is inconsistent with grazing activities authorized in the permit, the special land use area will be withdrawn from the permit, and grazing cannot take place on that part of the range unit.

      Subpart G—Permit Violations

        § 161.600   What permit violations are addressed by this subpart?

#### § § 161.600

        (a) The District Grazing Committee will conduct the mediation before the Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body, before BIA invokes any cancellation remedies.

        (b) Conducting the mediation may substitute for permit cancellation. However, BIA retains the authority to cancel the permit under § 161.606.

        (c) The Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body decision will be final, unless it is appealed to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court on a question of law. BIA will defer to any ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to BIA under § 161.606.

        § 161.604   What happens if a permit violation occurs?

        The written notice of a permit violation will provide the permittee with 10 days from the receipt of the written notice to:

        (a) Cure the permit violation and notify BIA that the violation is cured;

        (b) Explain why BIA should not cancel the permit;

        (c) Request in writing additional time to complete corrective actions. If additional time is granted, BIA may require that certain actions be taken immediately; or

        (d) Request mediation under § 161.603.

#### § § 161.606

        (a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required time period, or if the violation is not referred to District Grazing Committee for mediation, BIA will consult with the Navajo Nation, as appropriate, and determine whether:

        (1) The permit may be canceled by BIA under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 161.607 through 161.608;

        (2) BIA may invoke any other remedies available to BIA under the permit;

        (3) The Navajo Nation may invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or

        (4) The permittee may be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

        (b) If BIA grants a permittee a time extension to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time from the date on which the extension is granted.

        (c) If BIA cancels the permit, BIA will send the permittee and the District Grazing Committee a written notice of cancellation within 5 business days of the decision. BIA will also provide actual or constructive notice of the cancellation to the Navajo Nation, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:

        (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

        (2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid fees and other financial obligations due under the permit;

        (3) Notify the permittee of his or her right to appeal under 25 CFR part 2 of this title, as modified by § 161.607, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

        (4) Order the permittee to cease grazing livestock on the next anniversary date of the grazing permit or 180 days following the receipt of the written notice of cancellation, whichever is sooner.

        § 161.607   What appeal bond provisions apply to permit cancellation decisions?

#### § § 161.607

        (a) The appeal bond provisions in § 2.5 of part 2 of this title will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decision. Instead, when BIA decides to cancel a permit, BIA may require the permittee to post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in part 2 of this title.

        (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect the Navajo Nation against financial losses that will likely result from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the permit cancellation decision.

        § 161.608   When will a permit cancellation be effective?

#### § § 161.608

        A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation from BIA. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the permittee files an appeal under § 161.607 and part 2 of this title, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 161.607 and part 2 of this title, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of cancellation from BIA.

        § 161.609   Can BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is threatened?

#### § § 161.609

        Yes, if a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Navajo Nation land during the term of a permit, BIA will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart H, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Navajo Nation, either before or after the emergency action is taken.

        § 161.610   What will BIA do if livestock is not removed when a permit expires or is cancelled?

#### § § 161.610

        If the livestock is not removed after the expiration or cancellation of a permit, BIA will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass.

          (b) The following table provides examples of some common characteristics of permits versus leases.

          (c) We will not administer or enforce permits on Indian land.

          (2) Leases in Alaska require consent of all of the Indian landowners in the tract.

          (3) If the prospective lessee is also an Indian landowner, his or her consent will be included in the percentages in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

          (4) Where owners of the applicable percentages in paragraph (a)(1) of this section consent to a lease document:

          (i) That lease document binds all non-consenting owners to the same extent as if those owners also consented to the lease document; and

          (ii) That lease document will not bind a non-consenting Indian tribe, except with respect to the tribally owned fractional interest, and the non-consenting Indian tribe will not be treated as a party to the lease. Nothing in this paragraph affects the sovereignty or sovereign immunity of the Indian tribe.

          (5) We will determine the number of owners of, and undivided interests in, a fractionated tract of Indian land, for the purposes of calculating the percentages in paragraph (a)(1) of this section based on our records on the date on which the lease is submitted to us for approval.

          (b) Tribal land subject to a tribal land assignment may only be leased with the consent of the tribe.

          § 162.019   May a lease address access to the leased premises by roads or other infrastructure?

          § 162.020   May a lease combine tracts with different Indian landowners?

#### § § 162.020

          (a) We may approve a lease that combines multiple tracts of Indian land into a unit, if we determine that unitization is:

          (1) In the Indian landowners' best interest; and

          (2) Consistent with the efficient administration of the land.

          (b) For a lease that covers multiple tracts, the minimum consent requirements apply to each tract separately.

          (c) Unless the lease provides otherwise, the rent or other compensation will be prorated in proportion to the acreage each tract contributes to the entire lease.

Nothing in this part prevents an Indian landowner from exercising remedies available to the Indian landowners under the lease or applicable law.

          (b) We will promptly respond to requests for BIA approval of amendments, assignments, leasehold mortgages, and subleases, as specified in subparts C, D, and E.

#### § § 162.023

          If an individual or entity takes possession of, or uses, Indian land without a lease and a lease is required, the unauthorized possession or use is a trespass.

The Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under applicable law.

          § 162.024   May BIA take emergency action if Indian land is threatened?

#### § § 162.024

          (a) We may take appropriate emergency action if there is a natural disaster or if an individual or entity causes or threatens to cause immediate and significant harm to Indian land. Emergency action may include judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm.

          (b) We will make reasonable efforts to notify the individual Indian landowners before and after taking emergency action. In all cases, we will notify the Indian landowners after taking emergency action by actual or constructive notice. We will provide written notification of our action to the Indian tribe exercising jurisdiction over the Indian land before and after taking emergency action.

          § 162.025   May decisions under this part be appealed?

#### § § 162.025

          Appeals from BIA decisions under this part may be taken under part 2 of this chapter, except for deemed approvals and as otherwise provided in this part. For purposes of appeals from BIA decisions under this part, “interested party” is defined as any person whose own direct economic interest is adversely affected by an action or decision. Our decision to disapprove a lease may be appealed only by an Indian landowner. Our decision to disapprove any other lease document may be appealed only by the Indian landowners or the lessee.

          (b) We will adopt environmental assessments and environmental impact statements prepared by another Federal agency, Indian tribe, entity, or person under 43 CFR 46.320 and 42 CFR 1506.3, including those prepared under 25 U.S.C. 4115 and 25 CFR part 1000, but may require a supplement. We will use any reasonable evidence that another Federal agency has accepted the environmental report, including but not limited to, letters of approval or acceptance.

          (c) Upon our request, the parties must make appropriate records, reports, or information available for our inspection and duplication. We will keep confidential any information that is marked confidential or proprietary and will exempt it from public release to the extent allowed by law and in accordance with 43 CFR part 2. We may, at our discretion, treat a lessee's failure to cooperate with such request, provide data, or grant access to information or records as a lease violation.

          § 162.028   How may an Indian tribe obtain information about leases on its land?

#### § § 162.028

          Upon request of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction, BIA will promptly provide information on the status of leases on tribal land, without requiring a Freedom of Information Act request.

          (b) When this part requires us to notify the parties of our determination to approve or disapprove a lease document, and to provide any right of appeal:

          (1) For leases of tribal land, we will notify the lessee and the tribe by mail; and

          § 162.202   How will tribal laws be enforced on agricultural land?

#### § § 162.202

          (1) Waive the general prohibition against tenant preferences in leases advertised for bid under § 162.212 of this subpart, by allowing prospective Indian tenants to match the highest responsible bid (unless the tribal leasing policy specifies some other manner in which the preference must be afforded);

          (2) Waive the requirement that a tenant post a bond under § 162.234 of this subpart;

          (3) Modify the requirement that a tenant post a bond in a form described in § 162.235 of this subpart;

          (4) Approve leases of tribal land at rates established by the tribe, as provided in § 162.222(b) of this subpart.

          (1) The tribal law or leasing policy adopts an alternative plan for providing notice to Indian landowners, before an agricultural lease is granted by us on their behalf; and

          (2) A waiver or modification of the three-month notice requirement is needed to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage, and ensure lease income to the Indian landowners.

          (d) Tribal leasing policies of the type described in paragraphs (b) through (c) of this section will not apply to individually-owned land that has been made exempt from such laws or policies under § 162.205 of this subpart.

Such notice will be provided in the manner described in paragraphs (b) through (c) of this section.

          (b) We will provide notice to Indian landowners, as to the superseding or modifying effect of any tribal leasing policy and their right to exempt their land from such a policy. Such notice will be provided by:

          (1) Written notice included in a notice of our intent to lease the land, issued under § 162.209(b) of this subpart; or

          (2) Public notice posted at the tribal community building or the United States Post Office, or published in the local newspaper that serves the area in which the Indian owners' land is located, at the time the tribal leasing policy is adopted.

          (2) Public notice posted at the tribal community building or the United States Post Office, or published in a local newspaper of general circulation, at the time the tribal law is enacted or the leasing policy adopted.

          (a) Individual Indian landowners may exempt their agricultural land from the application of a tribal leasing policy of a type described in § 162.203(b) through (c) of this subpart, if the Indian owners of at least 50% of the trust or restricted interests in the land submit a written objection to us before a lease is granted or approved.

          (b) Upon our receipt of a written objection from the Indian landowners that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, we will notify the tribe that the owners' land has been exempted from a specific tribal leasing policy. If the exempted land is part of a unitized lease tract, such land will be removed from the unit and leased separately, if appropriate.

          (c) The procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will also apply to withdrawing an approved exemption.

        How to Obtain a Lease

          § 162.206   Can the terms of an agricultural lease be negotiated with the Indian landowners?

#### § § 162.206

          An agricultural lease may be obtained through negotiation. We will assist prospective tenants in contacting the Indian landowners or their representatives for the purpose of negotiating a lease, and we will assist the landowners in those negotiations upon request.

          § 162.207   When can the Indian landowners grant an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.207

          (a) Tribes grant leases of tribally-owned agricultural land, including any tribally-owned undivided interest(s) in a fractionated tract, subject to our approval. Where tribal land is subject to a land assignment made to a tribal member or some other individual under tribal law or custom, the individual and the tribe must both grant the lease, subject to our approval.

          (b) Adult Indian owners, or emancipated minors, may grant agricultural leases of their land, including undivided interests in fractionated tracts, subject to our approval.

          (c) An agricultural lease of a fractionated tract may be granted by the owners of a majority interest in the tract, subject to our approval. Although prior notice to non-consenting individual Indian landowners is generally not needed prior to our approval of such a lease, a right of first refusal must be offered to any non-consenting Indian landowner who is using the entire lease tract at the time the lease is entered into by the owners of a majority interest. Where the owners of a majority interest grant such a lease on behalf of all of the Indian owners of a fractionated tract, the non-consenting Indian landowners must receive a fair annual rental.

          (d) As part of the negotiation of a lease, Indian landowners may advertise their land to identify potential tenants with whom to negotiate.

          § 162.208   Who can represent the Indian landowners in negotiating or granting an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.208

          The following individuals or entities may represent an individual Indian landowner:

          (a) An adult with custody acting on behalf of his or her minor children;

          (b) A guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to act on behalf of an individual Indian landowner;

          (c) An adult or legal entity who has been given a written power of attorney that:

          (1) Meets all of the formal requirements of any applicable tribal or state law;

          (2) Identifies the attorney-in-fact and the land to be leased; and

          (3) Describes the scope of the power granted and any limits thereon.

          § 162.209   When can BIA grant an agricultural lease on behalf of an Indian landowner?

#### § § 162.209

          (a) We may grant an agricultural lease on behalf of:

          (2) Orphaned minors;

          (3) The undetermined heirs and devisees of deceased Indian owners;

          (4) Individuals who have given us a written power of attorney to lease their land; and

          (5) Individuals whose whereabouts are unknown to us, after reasonable attempts are made to locate such individuals; and

          (6) The individual Indian landowners of fractionated Indian land, when necessary to protect the interests of the individual Indian landowners.

          (b) We may grant an agricultural lease on behalf of all of the individual Indian owners of a fractionated tract, where:

          (1) We have provided the Indian landowners with written notice of our intent to grant a lease on their behalf, but the Indian landowners are unable to agree upon a lease during a three-month negotiation period immediately following such notice, or any other notice period established by a tribe under § 162.203(c) of this subpart; and

          (2) The land is not being used by an Indian landowner under § 162.104(b) of this part.

          § 162.210   When can BIA grant a permit covering agricultural land?

#### § § 162.210

          (a) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land in the same manner as we would grant an agricultural lease under § 162.209 of this part. We may also grant a permit on behalf of individual Indian landowners, without prior notice, if it is impractical to provide notice to the owners and no substantial injury to the land will occur.

          (b) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land, but not an agricultural lease, on government land.

          (c) We will not grant a permit on tribal agricultural land, but a tribe may grant a permit, subject to our approval, in the same manner as it would grant a lease under § 162.207(a) of this subpart.

          § 162.211   What type of valuation or evaluation methods will be applied in estimating the fair annual rental of Indian land?

#### § § 162.211

          (a) To support the Indian landowners in their negotiations, and to assist in our consideration of whether an agricultural lease is in the Indian landowners' best interest, we must determine the fair annual rental of the land prior to our grant or approval of the lease, unless the land may be leased at less than a fair annual rental under § 162.222(b) through (c) of this subpart.

          (b) A fair annual rental may be determined by competitive bidding, appraisal, or any other appropriate valuation method. Where an appraisal or other valuation is needed to determine the fair annual rental, the appraisal or valuation must be prepared in accordance with USPAP.

          § 162.212   When will the BIA advertise Indian land for agricultural leases?

#### § § 162.212

          (a) We will generally advertise Indian land for agricultural leasing:

          (1) At the request of the Indian landowners; or

          (2) Before we grant a lease under § 162.209(b) of this subpart.

          (b) Advertisements will provide prospective tenants with notice of any superseding tribal laws and leasing policies that have been made applicable to the land under §§ 162.109 and 162.203 of this part, along with certain standard terms and conditions to be included in the lease. Advertisements will prohibit tenant preferences, and bidders at lease sales will not be afforded any preference, unless a preference in favor of individual Indians is required by a superseding tribal law or leasing policy.

          (c) Advertisements will require sealed bids, and they may also provide for further competitive bidding among the prospective tenants at the conclusion of the bid opening. Competitive bidding should be supported, at a minimum, by a market study or rent survey that is consistent with USPAP.

          § 162.213   What supporting documents must be provided prior to BIA's grant or approval of an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.213

          (a) If the tenant is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity, it must provide organizational and financial documents, as needed to show that the lease will be enforceable against the tenant and the tenant will be able to perform all of its lease obligations.

          (b) Where a bond is required under § 162.234 of this subpart, the bond must be furnished before we grant or approve the lease.

          (c) The tenant must provide environmental and archaeological reports, surveys, and site assessments, as needed to document compliance with NEPA and other applicable federal and tribal land use requirements.

          § 162.214   How and when will BIA decide whether to approve an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.214

          (a) Before we approve a lease, we must determine in writing that the lease is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the lease and supporting documents;

          (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances (including preparation of the appropriate review documents under NEPA);

          (3) Assure ourselves that adequate consideration has been given, as appropriate, to:

          (i) The relationship between the use of the leased premises and the use of neighboring lands;

          (ii) The height, quality, and safety of any structures or other facilities to be constructed on the leased premises;

          (iii) The availability of police and fire protection, utilities, and other essential community services;

          (iv) The availability of judicial forums for all criminal and civil matters arising on the leased premises; and

          (v) The effect on the environment of the proposed land use.

          (4) Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures that are needed to satisfy any requirements of this subpart, or any other federal or tribal land use requirements.

          (b) Where an agricultural lease is in a form that has previously been accepted or approved by us, and all of the documents needed to support the findings required by paragraph (a) of this section have been received, we will decide whether to approve the lease within 30 days of the date of our receipt of the lease and supporting documents. If we decide to approve or disapprove a lease, we will notify the parties immediately and advise them of their right to appeal the decision under part 2 of this chapter. Copies of agricultural leases that have been approved will be provided to the tenant, and made available to the Indian landowners upon request.

          § 162.215   When will an agricultural lease be effective?

#### § § 162.215

          Unless otherwise provided in the lease, an agricultural lease will be effective on the date on which the lease is approved by us. An agricultural lease may be made effective on some past or future date, by agreement, but such a lease may not be approved more than one year prior to the date on which the lease term is to commence.

          § 162.216   When will a BIA decision to approve an agricultural lease be effective?

#### § § 162.216

          Our decision to approve an agricultural lease will be effective immediately, notwithstanding any appeal that may be filed under part 2 of this chapter.

          § 162.217   Must an agricultural lease or permit be recorded?

#### § § 162.217

          (a) An agricultural lease or permit must be recorded in our Land Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the land. We will record the lease or permit immediately following our approval under this subpart.

          (b) Agricultural leases of tribal land that do not require our approval, under § 162.102 of this part, must be recorded by the tribe in our Land Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the land.

        Lease Requirements

          § 162.218   Is there a standard agricultural lease form?

#### § § 162.218

          Based on the need for flexibility in advertising, negotiating and drafting of appropriate lease terms and conditions, there is no standard agricultural lease form that must be used. We will assist the Indian landowners in drafting lease provisions that conform to the requirements of this part.

          § 162.219   Are there any provisions that must be included in an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.219

          In addition to the other requirements of this part, all agricultural leases must provide that:

          (a) The obligations of the tenant and its sureties to the Indian landowners will also be enforceable by the United States, so long as the land remains in trust or restricted status;

          (b) Nothing contained in this lease shall operate to delay or prevent a termination of federal trust responsibilities with respect to the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of the lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the lease. The owners of the land and the lessee and his surety or sureties shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land;

          (c) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of the leased premises; and

          (d) The tenant must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and other legal requirements, including tribal laws and leasing policies.

          § 162.220   Are there any formal requirements that must be satisfied in the execution of an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.220

          (a) An agricultural lease must identify the Indian landowners and their respective interests in the leased premises, and the lease must be granted by or on behalf of each of the Indian landowners. One who executes a lease in a representative capacity under § 162.208 of this subpart must identify the owner being represented and the authority under which such action is being taken.

          (b) An agricultural lease must be executed by individuals having the necessary capacity and authority to bind the tenant under applicable law.

          (c) An agricultural lease must include a citation of the provisions in this subpart that authorize our approval, along with a citation of the formal documents by which such authority has been delegated to the official taking such action.

          § 162.221   How should the land be described in an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.221

          An agricultural lease should describe the leased premises by reference to a public or private survey, if possible. If the land cannot be so described, the lease must include a legal description or other description that is sufficient to identify the leased premises, subject to our approval. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee status, the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should be identified in the description of the leased premises.

          § 162.222   How much rent must be paid under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.222

          (a) An agricultural lease must provide for the payment of a fair annual rental at the beginning of the lease term, unless a lesser amount is permitted under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. The tenant's rent payments may be:

          (1) In fixed amounts; or

          (2) Based on a share of the agricultural products generated by the lease, or a percentage of the income to be derived from the sale of such agricultural products.

          (b) We will approve an agricultural lease of tribal land at a nominal rent, or at less than a fair annual rental, if such a rent is negotiated or established by the tribe.

          (c) We will approve an agricultural lease of individually-owned land at a nominal rent or at less than a fair annual rental, if:

          (1) The tenant is a member of the Indian landowner's immediate family, or a co-owner in the lease tract; or

          (2) The tenant is a cooperative or other legal entity in which the Indian landowners directly participate in the revenues or profits generated by the lease.

          (d) We will grant or approve a lease at less than a fair annual rental, as previously determined by an appraisal or some other appropriate valuation method, if the land is subsequently advertised and the tenant is the highest responsible bidder.

          § 162.223   Must the rent be adjusted under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.223

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an agricultural lease must provide for one or more rental adjustments if the lease term runs more than five years, unless the lease provides for the payment of:

          (1) Less than a fair annual rental, as permitted under § 162.222(b) through (c) of this part; or

          (2) A rental based primarily on a share of the agricultural products generated by the lease, or a percentage of the income derived from the sale of agricultural products.

          (b) If rental adjustments are required, the lease must specify:

          (1) How adjustments are made;

          (2) Who makes the adjustments;

          (3) When the adjustments are effective; and

          (4) How disputes about the adjustments are resolved.

          (c) An agricultural lease of tribal land may run for a term of more than five years, without providing for a rental adjustment, if the tribe establishes such a policy under § 162.203(b)(4) and negotiates such a lease.

          § 162.224   When are rent payments due under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.224

          An agricultural lease must specify the dates on which all rent payments are due. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, rent payments may not be made or accepted more than one year in advance of the due date. Rent payments are due at the time specified in the lease, regardless of whether the tenant receives an advance billing or other notice that a payment is due.

          § 162.225   Will untimely rent payments made under an agricultural lease be subject to interest charges or late payment penalties?

#### § § 162.225

          An agricultural lease must specify the rate at which interest will accrue on any rent payment not made by the due date or any other date specified in the lease. A lease may also identify additional late payment penalties that will apply if a rent payment is not made by a specified date. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, such interest charges and late payment penalties will apply in the absence of any specific notice to the tenant from us or the Indian landowners, and the failure to pay such amounts will be treated as a lease violation under § 162.251 of this subpart.

          § 162.226   To whom can rent payments be made under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.226

          (a) An agricultural lease must specify whether rent payments will be made directly to the Indian landowners or to us on behalf of the Indian landowners. If the lease provides for payment to be made directly to the Indian landowners, the lease must also require that the tenant retain specific documentation evidencing proof of payment, such as canceled checks, cash receipt vouchers, or copies of money orders or cashier's checks, consistent with the provisions of §§ 162.112 and 162.113 of this part.

          (b) Rent payments made directly to the Indian landowners must be made to the parties specified in the lease, unless the tenant receives notice of a change of ownership. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, rent payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (c) A lease that provides for rent payments to be made directly to the Indian landowners must also provide for such payments to be suspended and the rent thereafter paid to us, rather than directly to the Indian landowners, if:

          (1) An Indian landowner dies;

          (2) An Indian landowner requests that payment be made to us;

          (3) An Indian landowner is found by us to be in need of assistance in managing his/her financial affairs; or

          (4) We determine, in our discretion and after consultation with the Indian landowner(s), that direct payment should be discontinued.

          § 162.227   What form of rent payment can be accepted under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.227

          (a) When rent payments are made directly to the Indian landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.

          (b) Payments made to us may be delivered in person or by mail. We will not accept cash, foreign currency, or third-party checks. We will accept:

          (1) Personal or business checks drawn on the account of the tenant;

          (2) Money orders;

          (3) Cashier's checks;

          (4) Certified checks; or

          (5) Electronic funds transfer payments.

          § 162.228   What other types of payments are required under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.228

          (a) The tenant may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and/or assessments associated with the use of the land, as determined by the tribe having jurisdiction over the land. The tenant must pay these amounts to the appropriate tribal official.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in part 171 of this chapter, if the leased premises are within an Indian irrigation project or drainage district, the tenant must pay all operation and maintenance charges that accrue during the lease term. The tenant must pay these amounts to the appropriate official in charge of the irrigation project or drainage district. Failure to make such payments will constitute a violation of the lease under § 162.251.

          § 162.229   How long can the term of an agricultural lease run?

#### § § 162.229

          (a) An agricultural lease must provide for a definite lease term, specifying the commencement date. The commencement date of the lease may not be more than one year after the date on which the lease is approved.

          (b) The lease term must be reasonable, given the purpose of the lease and the level of investment required. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the maximum term may not exceed ten years, unless a substantial investment in the improvement of the land is required. If such a substantial investment is required, the maximum term may be up to 25 years.

          (c) Where all of the trust or restricted interests in a tract are owned by a deceased Indian whose heirs and devisees have not yet been determined, the maximum term may not exceed two years.

          (d) An agricultural lease may not provide the tenant with an option to renew, and such a lease may not be renewed or extended by holdover.

          § 162.230   Can an agricultural lease be amended, assigned, sublet, or mortgaged?

#### § § 162.230

          (a) An agricultural lease may authorize amendments, assignments, subleases, or mortgages of the leasehold interest, but only with the written consent of the parties to the lease in the same manner the original lease was approved, and our approval. An attempt by the tenant to mortgage the leasehold interest or authorize possession by another party, without the necessary consent and approval, will be treated as a lease violation under § 162.251 of this subpart.

          (b) An agricultural lease may authorize us, one or more of the Indian landowners, or a designated representative of the Indian landowners, to consent to an amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, or other type of agreement, on the landowners' behalf. A designated landowner or representative may not negotiate or consent to an amendment, assignment, or sublease that would:

          (1) Reduce the rentals payable to the other Indian landowners; or

          (2) Terminate or modify the term of the lease.

          (c) Where the Indian landowners have not designated a representative for the purpose of consenting to an amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, or other type of agreement, such consent may be granted by or on behalf of the landowners in the same manner as a new lease, under §§ 162.207 through 162.209 of this subpart.

          § 162.231   How can the land be used under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.231

          (a) An agricultural lease must describe the authorized uses of the leased premises. Any use of the leased premises for an unauthorized purpose, or a failure by the tenant to maintain continuous operations throughout the lease term, will be treated as a lease violation under § 162.251 of this subpart.

          (b) An agricultural lease must require that farming and grazing operations be conducted in accordance with recognized principles of sustained yield management, integrated resource management planning, sound conservation practices, and other community goals as expressed in applicable tribal laws, leasing policies, or agricultural resource management plans. Appropriate stipulations or conservation plans must be developed and incorporated in all agricultural leases.

          § 162.232   Can improvements be made under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.232

          An agricultural lease must generally describe the type and location of any improvements to be constructed by the lessee. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, any specific plans for the construction of those improvements will not require the consent of the Indian owners or our approval.

          § 162.233   Who will own the improvements made under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.233

          (a) An agricultural lease may specify who will own any improvements constructed by the tenant, during the lease term. The lease must indicate whether any improvements constructed by the tenant will remain on the leased premises upon the expiration or termination of the lease, providing for the improvements to either:

          (1) Remain on the leased premises, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners and us; or

          (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the tenant's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as close as possible to their condition prior to construction of such improvements.

          (b) If the lease allows the tenant to remove the improvements, it must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to waive the removal requirement and take possession of the improvements if they are not removed within the specified time period. If the Indian landowners choose not to exercise this option, we will take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal at the tenant's expense.

          § 162.234   Must a tenant provide a bond under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.234

          Unless otherwise provided by a tribe under § 162.203 of this subpart, or waived by us at the request of the owners of a majority interest in an agricultural lease tract, the tenant must provide a bond to secure:

          (a) The payment of one year's rental;

          (b) The construction of any required improvements;

          (c) The performance of any additional lease obligations, including the payment of operation and maintenance charges under § 162.228(b) of this subpart; and

          (d) The restoration and reclamation of the leased premises, to their condition at the commencement of the lease term or some other specified condition.

          § 162.235   What form of bond can be accepted under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.235

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a bond must be deposited with us and made payable only to us, and such a bond may not be modified or withdrawn without our approval. We will only accept a bond in one of the following forms:

          (1) Cash;

          (2) Negotiable Treasury securities that:

          (i) Have a market value at least equal to the bond amount; and

          (ii) Are accompanied by a statement granting full authority to us to sell such securities in case of a violation of the terms of the lease.

          (3) Certificates of deposit that indicate on their face that our approval is required prior to redemption by any party;

          (4) Irrevocable letters of credit issued by federally-insured financial institutions authorized to do business in the United States. A letter of credit must:

          (i) Contain a clause that grants us the authority to demand immediate payment if the tenant violates the lease or fails to replace the letter of credit at least 30 days prior to its expiration date;

          (ii) Be payable to us;

          (iii) Be irrevocable during its term and have an initial expiration date of not less than one year following the date of issuance; and

          (iv) Be automatically renewable for a period of not less than one year, unless the issuing financial institution provides us with written notice that it will not be renewed, at least 90 calendar days before the letter of credit's expiration date.

          (5) A surety bond issued by a company approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury; or

          (6) Any other form of highly liquid, non-volatile security that is easily convertible to cash and for which our approval is required prior to redemption by any party.

          (b) A tribe may accept and hold any form of bond described in paragraph (a) of this section, to secure performance under an agricultural lease of tribal land.

          § 162.236   How will a cash bond be administered?

#### § § 162.236

          (a) If a cash bond is submitted, we will retain the funds in an account established in the name of the tenant.

          (b) We will not pay interest on a cash performance bond.

          (c) If the bond is not forfeited under § 162.252(a) of this subpart, we will refund the bond to the tenant upon the expiration or termination of the lease.

          § 162.237   What insurance is required under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.237

          When necessary to protect the interests of the Indian landowners, an agricultural lease must require that a tenant provide insurance. Such insurance may include property, crop, liability and/or casualty insurance. If insurance is required, it must identify both the Indian landowners and the United States as insured parties, and be sufficient to protect all insurable improvements on the leased premises.

          § 162.238   What indemnities are required under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.238

          (a) An agricultural lease must require that the tenant indemnify and hold the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the tenant's use or occupation of the leased premises, unless:

          (1) The tenant would be prohibited by law from making such an agreement; or (2) The interests of the Indian landowners are adequately protected by insurance.

          (b) Unless the tenant would be prohibited by law from making such an agreement, an agricultural lease must specifically require that the tenant indemnify the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or the release or discharge of any hazardous materials from the leased premises that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault.

          § 162.239   How will payment rights and obligations relating to agricultural land be allocated between the Indian landowners and the tenant?

#### § § 162.239

          (a) Unless otherwise provided in an agricultural lease, the Indian landowners will be entitled to receive any settlement funds or other payments arising from certain actions that diminish the value of the land or the improvements thereon. Such payments may include (but are not limited to) :

          (1) Insurance proceeds;

          (2) Trespass damages; and

          (3) Condemnation awards.

          (b) An agricultural lease may provide for the tenant to assume certain cost-share or other payment obligations that have attached to the land through past farming and grazing operations, so long as those obligations are specified in the lease and considered in any determination of fair annual rental made under this subpart.

          § 162.240   Can an agricultural lease provide for negotiated remedies in the event of a violation?

#### § § 162.240

          (a) A lease of tribal agricultural land may provide the tribe with certain negotiated remedies in the event of a lease violation, including the power to terminate the lease. An agricultural lease of individually-owned land may provide the individual Indian landowners with similar remedies, so long as the lease also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the landowners.

          (b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to us under § 162.252(c) of this subpart. If the lease specifically authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for cancellation.

          (c) An agricultural lease may provide for lease disputes to be resolved in tribal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or through arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us under § 162.252 of this subpart.

        Lease Administration

          § 162.241   Will administrative fees be charged for actions relating to agricultural leases?

#### § § 162.241

          (a) We will charge an administrative fee each time we approve an agricultural lease, amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, or related document. These fees will be paid by the tenant, assignee, or subtenant, to cover our costs in preparing or processing the documents and administering the lease.

          (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, we will charge administrative fees based on the rent payable under the lease. The fee will be 3% of the annual rent payable, including any percentage-based rent that can be reasonably estimated.

          (d) If all or part of the expenses of the work are paid from tribal funds, the tribe may establish an additional or alternate schedule of fees.

          § 162.242   How will BIA decide whether to approve an amendment to an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.242

          We will approve an agricultural lease amendment if:

          (a) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the lease under § 162.230 and any sureties; and

          (b) We find the amendment to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners, under the standards set forth in § 162.213 of this subpart.

          § 162.243   How will BIA decide whether to approve an assignment or sublease under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.243

          (a) We will approve an assignment or sublease under an agricultural lease if:

          (1) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the lease under § 162.230 and the tenant's sureties;

          (2) The tenant is not in violation of the lease;

          (3) The assignee agrees to be bound by, or the subtenant agrees to be subordinated to, the terms of the lease; and

          (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian owners.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, we will consider whether:

          (1) The Indian landowners should receive any income derived by the tenant from the assignment or sublease, under the terms of the lease;

          (2) The proposed use by the assignee or subtenant will require an amendment of the lease;

          (3) The value of any part of the leased premises not covered by the assignment or sublease would be adversely affected; and

          (4) The assignee or subtenant has bonded its performance and provided supporting documents that demonstrate that the lease or sublease will be enforceable against the assignee or subtenant, and that the assignee or subtenant will be able to perform its obligations under the lease or sublease.

          § 162.244   How will BIA decide whether to approve a leasehold mortgage under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.244

          (a) We will approve a leasehold mortgage under an agricultural lease if:

          (1) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the lease under § 162.230 and the tenant's sureties;

          (2) The mortgage covers only the tenant's interest in the leased premises, and no unrelated collateral;

          (3) The loan being secured by the mortgage will be used only in connection with the development or use of the leased premises, and the mortgage does not secure any unrelated debts owed by the tenant to the mortgagee; and

          (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, we will consider whether:

          (1) The tenant's ability to comply with the lease would be adversely affected by any new loan obligations;

          (2) Any lease provisions would be modified by the mortgage;

          (3) The remedies available to us or to the Indian landowners would be limited (beyond any additional notice and cure rights to be afforded to the mortgagee), in the event of a lease violation; and

          (4) Any rights of the Indian landowners would be subordinated or adversely affected in the event of a loan default by the tenant.

          § 162.245   When will a BIA decision to approve an amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage under an agricultural lease be effective?

#### § § 162.245

          Our decision to approve an amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage under an agricultural lease will be effective immediately, notwithstanding any appeal that may be filed under part 2 of this chapter. Copies of approved documents will be provided to the party requesting approval, and made available to the Indian landowners upon request.

          § 162.246   Must an amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage approved under an agricultural lease be recorded?

#### § § 162.246

          An amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage approved under an agricultural lease must be recorded in our Land Titles and Records Office that has jurisdiction over the leased premises. We will record the document immediately following our approval under this subpart.

        Lease Enforcement

          § 162.247   Will BIA notify a tenant when a rent payment is due under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.247

          We may issue bills or invoices to a tenant in advance of the dates on which rent payments are due under an agricultural lease, but the tenant's obligation to make such payments in a timely manner will not be excused if such bills or invoices are not delivered or received.

          § 162.248   What will BIA do if rent payments are not made in the time and manner required by an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.248

          (a) A tenant's failure to pay rent in the time and manner required by an agricultural lease will be a violation of the lease, and a notice of violation will be issued under § 162.251 of this subpart. If the lease requires that rent payments be made to us, we will send the tenant and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date on which the rent payment was due. If the lease provides for payment directly to the Indian landowners, we will send the tenant and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the landowners.

          (b) If a tenant fails to provide adequate proof of payment or cure the violation within the requisite time period described in § 162.251(b) of this subpart, and the amount due is not in dispute, we may immediately take action to recover the amount of the unpaid rent and any associated interest charges or late payment penalties. We may also cancel the lease under § 162.252 of this subpart, or invoke any other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including collection on any available bond or referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection. An action to recover any unpaid amounts will not be conditioned on the prior cancellation of the lease or any further notice to the tenant, nor will such an action be precluded by a prior cancellation.

          (c) Partial payments may be accepted by the Indian landowners or us, but acceptance will not operate as a waiver with respect to any amounts remaining unpaid or any other existing lease violations. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, overpayments may be credited as an advance against future rent payments, or refunded.

          (d) If a personal or business check is dishonored, and a rent payment is therefore not made by the due date, the failure to make the payment in a timely manner will be a violation of the lease, and a notice of violation will be issued under § 162.251 of this subpart. Any payment made to cure such a violation, and any future payments by the same tenant, must be made by one of the alternative payment methods listed in § 162.227(b) of this subpart.

          § 162.249   Will any special fees be assessed on delinquent rent payments due under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.249

          The following special fees will be assessed if rent is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to any interest or late payment penalties that must be paid to the Indian landowners under an agricultural lease. The following special fees will be assessed to cover administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of the debt:

          § 162.250   How will BIA determine whether the activities of a tenant under an agricultural lease are in compliance with the terms of the lease?

#### § § 162.250

          (a) Unless an agricultural lease provides otherwise, we may enter the leased premises at any reasonable time, without prior notice, to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and ensure that the tenant is in compliance with the operating requirements of the lease.

          (b) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific lease violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation within five business days of that notification.

          § 162.251   What will BIA do in the event of a violation under an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.251

          (a) If we determine that an agricultural lease has been violated, we will send the tenant and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of that determination. The notice of violation must be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested.

          (b) Within ten business days of the receipt of a notice of violation, the tenant must:

          (1) Cure the violation and notify us in writing that the violation has been cured;

          (2) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred and/or explain why we should not cancel the lease; or

          (3) Request additional time to cure the violation.

          § 162.252   What will BIA do if a violation of an agricultural lease is not cured within the requisite time period?

#### § § 162.252

          (a) If the tenant does not cure a violation of an agricultural lease within the requisite time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether:

          (1) The lease should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 162.253 through 162.254 of this subpart;

          (2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the lease, including collecting on any available bond;

          (3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the lease; or

          (4) The tenant should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

          (b) If we decide to grant a tenant additional time in which to cure a violation, the tenant must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time period from the date on which the extension is granted.

          (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the tenant and its sureties a cancellation letter within five business days of that decision. The cancellation letter must be sent to the tenant by certified mail, return receipt requested. We will also provide actual or constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as appropriate. The cancellation letter will:

          (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

          (2) Notify the tenant of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest charges, or late payment penalties due under the lease;

          (3) Notify the tenant of its right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, as modified by § 162.253 of this subpart, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

          (4) Order the tenant to vacate the property within 30 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time.

          § 162.253   Will BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds apply to cancellation decisions involving agricultural leases?

#### § § 162.253

          (a) The appeal bond provisions in § 2.5 of part 2 of this chapter will not apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions made under § 162.252 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to cancel an agricultural lease, we may require that the tenant post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in part 2 of this chapter.

          (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the lease cancellation decision.

          § 162.254   When will a cancellation of an agricultural lease be effective?

#### § § 162.254

          A cancellation decision involving an agricultural lease will not be effective until 30 days after the tenant receives a cancellation letter from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the tenant files an appeal under § 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the tenant must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the lease. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the tenant receives the cancellation letter from us.

          § 162.255   Can BIA take emergency action if the leased premises are threatened with immediate and significant harm?

#### § § 162.255

          If a tenant or any other party causes or threatens to cause immediate and significant harm to the leased premises during the term of an agricultural lease, we will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under part 166, subpart I, of this chapter, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Indian landowners, either before or after the emergency action is taken.

          § 162.256   What will BIA do if a tenant holds over after the expiration or cancellation of an agricultural lease?

#### § § 162.256

          If a tenant remains in possession after the expiration or cancellation of an agricultural lease, we will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the tenant is engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new lease, we will take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, including the assessment of civil penalties and costs under part 166, subpart I, of this chapter.

#### § § 162.105

        (a) An agricultural lease negotiated by Indian landowners may cover more than one tract of Indian land, but the minimum consent requirements for leases granted by Indian landowners under subparts B through D of this part will apply to each tract separately. We may combine multiple tracts into a unit for leases negotiated or advertised by us, if we determine that unitization is in the Indian landowners' best interests and consistent with the efficient administration of the land.

        (b) Unless otherwise provided in the agricultural lease, the rent or other consideration derived from a unitized agricultural lease will be distributed based on the size of each landowner's interest in proportion to the acreage within the entire unit.

#### § § 162.106

        (a) If an agricultural lease is required, and possession is taken without an agricultural lease by a party other than an Indian landowner of the tract, we will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass.

        We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land for agricultural purposes. For the purposes of §§ 162.102 through 162.256:

        (a) We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land, either through negotiations or advertisement. In reviewing a negotiated lease for approval, we will defer to the landowners' determination that the lease is in their best interest, to the maximum extent possible. In granting a lease on the landowners' behalf, we will obtain a fair annual rental and attempt to ensure (through proper notice) that the use of the land is consistent with the landowners' wishes. We will also recognize the rights of Indian landowners to use their own land, so long as their Indian co-owners are in agreement and the value of the land is preserved.

        (b) We will recognize the governing authority of the tribe having jurisdiction over the land to be leased, preparing and advertising leases in accordance with applicable tribal laws and policies. We will promote tribal control and self-determination over tribal land and other land under the tribe's jurisdiction, through contracts and self-governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. § 450f

#### § § 162.108

        (a) We will ensure that tenants meet their payment obligations to Indian landowners, through the collection of rent on behalf of the landowners and the prompt initiation of appropriate collection and enforcement actions. We will also assist landowners in the enforcement of payment obligations that run directly to them, and in the exercise of any negotiated remedies that apply in addition to specific remedies made available to us under these or other regulations.

        (b) We will ensure that tenants comply with the operating requirements in their agricultural leases, through appropriate inspections and enforcement actions as needed to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and respond to concerns expressed by them. We will take immediate action to recover possession from trespassers operating without an agricultural lease, and take other emergency action as needed to preserve the value of the land.

        (b) Tribal laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of the tribe enacting such laws, except to the extent that those tribal laws are inconsistent with these regulations or other applicable federal law. These regulations may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, however, so long as:

        (1) The tribal laws are consistent with the enacting tribe's governing documents;

        (2) The tribe has notified us of the superseding or modifying effect of the tribal laws;

        (3) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate a federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law; and

        (4) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to tribal land.

        (c) State law may apply to agricultural lease disputes or define the remedies available to the Indian landowners in the event of an agricultural lease violation by the tenant, if the agricultural lease so provides and the Indian landowners have expressly agreed to the application of state law.

        § 162.112   How must records associated with this part be preserved?

#### § § 162.112

        (a) Any organization, including tribes and tribal organizations, that have records identified in § 162.111(a) must preserve the records in accordance with approved Departmental records retention procedures under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapters 29, 31 and 33. These records and related records management practices and safeguards required under the Federal Records Act are subject to inspection by the Secretary and the Archivist of the United States.

        (b) A tribe or tribal organization should preserve the records identified in § 162.111(b) for the period of time authorized by the Archivist of the United States for similar Department of the Interior records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33. If a tribe or tribal organization does not preserve records associated with its conduct of business with the Department of the Interior under this part, it may prevent the tribe or tribal organization from being able to adequately document essential transactions or furnish information necessary to protect its legal and financial rights or those of persons directly affected by its activities.

        § 162.113   May decisions under this subpart be appealed?

#### § § 162.113

        Yes. Except where otherwise provided in this subpart, appeals from decisions by the BIA under this subpart may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR subpart 2.

          § 162.301   What types of leases does this subpart cover?

#### § § 162.301

          (a) This subpart covers both ground leases (undeveloped land) and leases of developed land (together with the permanent improvements thereon) on Indian land, for housing purposes. Leases covered by this subpart would authorize the construction or use of:

          (1) A single-family residence; and

          (2) Housing for public purposes, which may include office space necessary to administer programs for housing for public purposes.

          (b) Leases for other residential development (for example, single-family residential developments and multi-family developments that are not housing for public purposes) are covered under subpart D of this part.

          § 162.302   Is there a model residential lease form?

#### § § 162.302

          (a) We will make available one or more model lease forms that satisfy the formal requirements of this part, including, as appropriate, the model tribal lease form jointly developed by BIA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture. Use of a model lease form is not mandatory, provided all requirements of this part are met.

          (b) If a model lease form prepared by us is not used by the parties to a residential lease, we will assist the Indian landowners, upon their request, in drafting lease provisions or in using tribal lease forms that conform to the requirements of this part.

          § 162.303   Who needs a lease for housing for public purposes?

#### § § 162.303

          A TDHE or tribal housing authority must obtain an approved residential lease under this subpart from the Indian landowners if, under the terms of its charter, it is a legal entity independent from the tribe, regardless of whether it is owned and operated by the tribe. A TDHE or tribal housing authority does not need an approved residential lease under this subpart if the tribe has authorized the TDHE's or tribal housing authority's possession through a tribal land assignment.

        Lease Requirements

          § 162.311   How long may the term of a residential lease run?

#### § § 162.311

          (a) A residential lease must provide for a definite lease term, state if there is an option to renew, and if so, provide for a definite term for the renewal period.

          (1) The maximum term of a lease approved under 25 U.S.C. 4211 may not exceed 50 years or may be month-to-month. The lease may provide for an initial term of less than 50 years with a provision for one or more renewals, so long as the maximum term, including all renewals, does not exceed 50 years.

          (2) The maximum term of a lease approved under 25 U.S.C. 415(a) may not exceed 50 years (consisting of an initial term not to exceed 25 years and one renewal not to exceed 25 years), unless a Federal statute provides for a longer maximum term (e.g., 25 U.S.C. 415(a) allows for a maximum term of 99 years for certain tribes), a different initial term, renewal term, or number of renewals.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the lease term, including any renewal, is reasonable. For individually owned Indian land, we will review the lease term, including any renewal, to ensure it is reasonable, given the:

          (1) Purpose of the lease;

          (2) Type of financing; and

          (3) Level of investment.

          (c) Unless the lease provides otherwise, a residential lease may not be extended by holdover.

          § 162.312   What must the lease include if it contains an option to renew?

#### § § 162.312

          (a) If the lease provides for an option to renew, the lease must specify:

          (1) The time and manner in which the option must be exercised or is automatically effective;

          (2) That confirmation of the renewal will be submitted to us, unless the lease provides for automatic renewal;

          (3) Whether Indian landowner consent to the renewal is required;

          (4) That the lessee must provide notice of the renewal to the Indian landowners and any mortgagees;

          (5) The additional consideration, if any, that will be due upon the exercise of the option to renew or the start of the renewal term; and

          (6) Any other conditions for renewal (e.g., that the lessee not be in violation of the lease at the time of renewal).

          (b) We will record any renewal of a lease in the LTRO.

          § 162.313   Are there mandatory provisions that a residential lease must contain?

#### § § 162.313

          (a) All residential leases must identify:

          (1) The tract or parcel of land being leased;

          (2) The purpose of the lease and authorized uses of the leased premises;

          (3) The parties to the lease;

          (4) The term of the lease;

          (5) The ownership of permanent improvements and the responsibility for constructing, operating, maintaining, and managing permanent improvements under § 162.315; and

          (6) Payment requirements and late payment charges, including interest.

          (b) Where a representative executes a lease on behalf of an Indian landowner or lessee, the lease must identify the landowner or lessee being represented and the authority under which the action is taken.

          (c) All residential leases must include the following provisions:

          (1) The obligations of the lessee to the Indian landowners are also enforceable by the United States, so long as the land remains in trust or restricted status;

          (2) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of the leased premises;

          (3) The lessee must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and other legal requirements under § 162.014;

          (4) If historic properties, archeological resources, human remains, or other cultural items not previously reported are encountered during the course of any activity associated with this lease, all activity in the immediate vicinity of the properties, resources, remains, or items will cease and the lessee will contact BIA and the tribe with jurisdiction to determine how to proceed and appropriate disposition;

          (5) BIA has the right, at any reasonable time during the term of the lease and upon reasonable notice in accordance with § 162.364, to enter the leased premises for inspection and to ensure compliance; and

          (6) BIA may, at its discretion, treat as a lease violation any failure by the lessee to cooperate with a BIA request to make appropriate records, reports, or information available for BIA inspection and duplication.

          (d) Unless the lessee would be prohibited by law from doing so, the lease must also contain the following provisions:

          (1) The lessee holds the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the lessee's use or occupation of the leased premises; and

          (2) The lessee indemnifies the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or release or discharge of any hazardous material from the leased premises that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault, with the exception that the lessee is not required to indemnify the Indian landowners for liability or cost arising from the Indian landowners' negligence or willful misconduct.

          (e) We may treat any provision of a lease document that violates Federal law as a violation of the lease.

          § 162.314   May permanent improvements be made under a residential lease?

#### § § 162.314

          (a) The lessee may construct permanent improvements under a residential lease if the residential lease authorizes the construction and generally describes the type and location of the permanent improvements to be constructed during the lease term.

          (b) The lessee must provide reasonable notice to the Indian landowners of the construction of any permanent improvements not generally described in the lease.

          § 162.315   How must a residential lease address ownership of permanent improvements?

#### § § 162.315

          (a) A residential lease must specify who will own any permanent improvements the lessee constructs during the lease term. In addition, the lease must indicate whether each specific permanent improvement the lessee constructs will:

          (1) Remain on the leased premises upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners and become the property of the Indian landowners;

          (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before construction of the permanent improvements; or

          (3) Be disposed of by other specified means.

          (b) A lease that requires the lessee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession of and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.

          § 162.316   How will BIA enforce removal requirements in a residential lease?

#### § § 162.316

          We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:

          (a) In consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and

          (b) Before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease.

          § 162.317   How must a residential lease describe the land?

#### § § 162.317

          (a) A residential lease must describe the leased premises by reference to a public or private survey, if possible. If the land cannot be so described, the lease must include one or more of the following:

          (1) A legal description;

          (2) A survey-grade global positioning system description; or

          (3) Another description prepared by a registered land surveyor that is sufficient to identify the leased premises.

          (b) If the tract is fractionated, we will identify the undivided trust or restricted interests in the leased premises.

        Rental Requirements

          § 162.320   How much rent must be paid under a residential lease of tribal land?

#### § § 162.320

          (a) A residential lease of tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation, if:

          (1) The lease is for housing for public purposes; or

          (2) The tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the negotiated amount to be in its best interest.

          (b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market rental, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 162.322. After providing the tribe with the fair market rental, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the lease provide for fair market rental based on a valuation in accordance with § 162.322.

          § 162.321   How much rent must be paid under a residential lease of individually owned Indian land?

#### § § 162.321

          (a) A residential lease of individually owned Indian land must require payment of not less than fair market rental except that we may approve a lease of individually owned Indian land that provides for the payment of nominal rent, or less than a fair market rental, if:

          (1) One hundred percent of the Indian landowners execute a written waiver of the right to receive fair market rental; or

          (2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.

          (b) We will require a valuation in accordance with § 162.322, unless:

          (1) One hundred percent of the Indian landowners submit to us a written request to waive the valuation requirement; or

          (2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.

          (c) If the owners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 consent to a residential lease on behalf of all the Indian landowners of a fractionated tract, the lease must provide that the non-consenting Indian landowners (and those on whose behalf we have consented) receive fair market rental, as determined by a valuation, unless we waive the requirement because:

          (1) The lessee is a co-owner who, as of January 4, 2013, has been residing on the tract for at least 7 years, and no other co-owner raises an objection to BIA by July 3, 2013 to the lessee's continued possession of the tract; or

          (2) The tribe or lessee will construct infrastructure improvements on, or serving, the leased premises, and we determine it is in the best interest of all the landowners.

          § 162.322   How will BIA determine fair market rental for a residential lease?

#### § § 162.322

          (a) We will use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine the fair market rental for residential leases of individually owned Indian land. We will also do this, at the request of the tribe, for tribal land.

          (b) We will either:

          (1) Prepare, or have prepared, a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method; or

          (2) Use an approved market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method from the Indian landowners or lessee.

          (c) We will use or approve a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method for use only if it:

          (1) Has been prepared in accordance with USPAP or a valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214; and

          (2) Complies with Department policies regarding appraisals, including third-party appraisals.

          § 162.323   When are rental payments due under a residential lease?

#### § § 162.323

          (a) A residential lease must specify the dates on which payments are due.

          (b) Unless the lease provides otherwise, payments may not be made or accepted more than one year in advance of the due date.

          (c) Payments are due at the time specified in the lease, regardless of whether the lessee receives an advance billing or other notice that a payment is due.

          § 162.324   Must a residential lease specify who receives rental payments?

#### § § 162.324

          (a) A residential lease must specify whether the lessee will make payments directly to the Indian landowners (direct pay) or to us on their behalf.

          (b) The lessee may make payments directly to the Indian landowners if:

          (1) The Indian landowners' trust accounts are unencumbered;

          (2) There are 10 or fewer beneficial owners; and

          (3) One hundred percent of the beneficial owners (including those on whose behalf we have consented) agree to receive payment directly from the lessee at the start of the lease.

          (c) If the lease provides that the lessee will directly pay the Indian landowners, then:

          (1) The lease must include provisions for proof of payment upon our request.

          (2) When we consent on behalf of an Indian landowner, the lessee must make payment to us on behalf of that landowner.

          (3) The lessee must send direct payments to the parties and addresses specified in the lease, unless the lessee receives notice of a change of ownership or address.

          (4) Unless the lease provides otherwise, payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (5) Direct payments must continue through the duration of the lease, except that:

          (i) The lessee must make all Indian landowners' payments to us if 100 percent of the Indian landowners agree to suspend direct pay and provide us with documentation of their agreement; and

          (ii) The lessee must make an individual Indian landowner's payment to us if that individual Indian landowner who dies, is declared non compos mentis, owes a debt resulting in a trust account encumbrance, or his or her whereabouts become unknown.

          § 162.325   What form of payment is acceptable under a residential lease?

#### § § 162.325

          (a) When payments are made directly to Indian landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.

          (b) When payments are made to us, our preferred method of payment is electronic funds transfer payments. We will also accept:

          (1) Money orders;

          (2) Personal checks;

          (3) Certified checks; or

          (4) Cashier's checks.

          (c) We will not accept cash or foreign currency.

          (d) We will accept third-party checks only from financial institutions or Federal agencies.

          § 162.326   May a residential lease provide for non-monetary or varying types of compensation?

#### § § 162.326

          (a) A lease may provide for the following, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

          (1) Alternative forms of rental, including, but not limited to in-kind consideration; or

          (2) Varying types of compensation at specific stages during the life of the lease.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the compensation under paragraph (a) of this section is in its best interest, if either:

          (1) The lease is for housing for public purposes; or

          (2) The tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the compensation under paragraph (a) of this section to be in its best interest.

          (c) For individually owned Indian land, we may approve a lease that provides for compensation under paragraph (a) of this section if we determine that it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          § 162.327   Will BIA notify a lessee when a payment is due under a residential lease?

#### § § 162.327

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a lessee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under a residential lease. The lessee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not issued, delivered, or received.

          § 162.328   Must a residential lease provide for rental reviews or adjustments?

#### § § 162.328

          (a) For a residential lease of tribal land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of rent or rental adjustment is required if:

          (1) The tribe states in a tribal certification or authorization that it has determined that not having rental reviews and/or adjustments is in its best interest; or

          (2) The lease is for housing for public purposes.

          (b) For a residential lease of individually Indian owned land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of rent or rental adjustment is required if:

          (1) The lease is for housing for public purposes;

          (2) The term of the lease is 5 years or less;

          (3) The lease provides for automatic rental adjustments; or

          (4) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners not to require a review or automatic adjustment based on circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:

          (i) The lease provides for payment of less than fair market rental; or

          (ii) The lease provides for most or all rent to be paid during the first 5 years of the lease term or before the date the review would be conducted.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, a review of the adequacy of rent must occur at least every fifth year, in the manner specified in the lease. The lease must specify:

          (1) When adjustments take effect;

          (2) Who can make adjustments;

          (3) What the adjustments are based on; and

          (4) How to resolve disputes arising from the adjustments.

          (d) When a review results in the need for adjustment of rent, the Indian landowners must consent to the adjustment in accordance with § 162.012, unless the lease provides otherwise.

#### § § 162.329

          (a) The lessee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and assessments associated with the use of the land, as determined by entities having jurisdiction, except as provided in § 162.017. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office.

          (b) If the leased premises are within an Indian irrigation project or drainage district, except as otherwise provided in part 171 of this chapter, the lessee must pay all operation and maintenance charges that accrue during the lease term. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office in charge of the irrigation project or drainage district. We will treat failure to make these payments as a violation of the lease.

        Bonding and Insurance

          § 162.334   Is a performance bond required for a residential lease document?

#### § § 162.334

          (a) A lease executed by the Indian landowners and the lessee that meets the requirements of this part;

          (b) For tribal land, a tribal authorization for the lease and, if applicable, meeting the requirements of §§ 162.320(a), 162.326(b), and 162.328(a), or a separate signed certification meeting the requirements of §§ 162.320(a), 162.326(b), and 162.328(a);

          (3) The legal entity is in good standing and authorized to conduct business in the jurisdiction where the land is located.

          § 162.339   Will BIA review a proposed residential lease before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation?

#### § § 162.339

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we will review the proposed residential lease after negotiation by the parties, before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation and any valuation. Within 10 days of receiving the proposed lease, we will provide an acknowledgement of the terms of the lease and identify any provisions that, based on this acknowledgment review, would justify disapproval of the lease, pending results of the NEPA review and any valuation.

          § 162.340   What is the approval process for a residential lease?

#### § § 162.340

          (a) Before we approve a residential lease, we must determine that the lease is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the lease and supporting documents;

          (2) Ensure compliance with applicable laws and ordinances;

          (3) If the lease is being approved under 25 U.S.C. 415, assure ourselves that adequate consideration has been given to the factors in 25 U.S.C. 415(a); and

          (4) Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures necessary to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land use requirements.

          (b) Upon receiving a residential lease package, we will promptly notify the parties whether the package is or is not complete. A complete package includes all the information and supporting documents required under this subpart, including but not limited to, NEPA review documentation and valuation documentation, where applicable.

          (1) If the residential lease package is not complete, our letter will identify the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If we do not respond to the submission of a residential lease package, the parties may take action under § 162.363.

          (2) If the residential lease package is complete, we will notify the parties of the date of receipt. Within 30 days of the receipt date, we will approve or disapprove the lease or return the package for revision.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadlines in this section, then the parties may take action under § 162.363.

          (d) We will provide any lease approval or disapproval and the basis for the determination, along with notification of any appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter, in writing to the parties to the lease.

          (e) Any residential lease issued under the authority of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, 25 U.S.C 4211(a), whether on tribal land or on individually owned Indian land, must be approved by us and by the affected tribe.

          (f) We will provide approved residential leases on tribal land to the lessee and provide a copy to the tribe. We will provide approved residential leases on individually owned Indian land to the lessee, and make copies available to the Indian landowners upon written request.

          § 162.341   How will BIA decide whether to approve a residential lease?

#### § § 162.341

          (a) We will approve a residential lease unless:

          (1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the lease;

          (2) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the residential lease is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a lease.

          (2) The notice of violation will advise the lessee that, within 10 business days of the receipt of a notice of violation, the lessee must:

          (i) Cure the violation and notify us, and the tribe for tribal land, in writing that the violation has been cured;

          (c) A lessee's failure to pay rent in the time and manner required by a residential lease is a violation of the lease, and we will issue a notice of violation in accordance with this paragraph.

          (1) We will send the lessee and any mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested:

          (i) Promptly following the date on which the payment was due, if the lease requires that rental payments be made to us; or

          (ii) Promptly following the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the Indian landowners, if the lease provides for payment directly to the Indian landowners.

          (2) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

          (3) The notice of violation will require the lessee to provide adequate proof of payment.

          (d) The lessee will continue to be responsible for the obligations in the lease until the lease expires or is terminated or cancelled.

          § 162.367   What will BIA do if the lessee does not cure a violation of a residential lease on time?

#### § § 162.367

          (a) If the lessee does not cure a violation of a residential lease within the required time period, or provide adequate proof of payment as required in the notice of violation, we will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether:

          (1) We should cancel the lease;

          (2) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the lease;

          (3) We should invoke other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including collection on any available performance bond or, for failure to pay rent, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or

          (4) The lessee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

          (b) Following consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, we may take action to recover unpaid rent and any associated late payment charges.

          (1) We do not have to cancel the lease or give any further notice to the lessee before taking action to recover unpaid rent.

          (2) We may still take action to recover any unpaid rent if we cancel the lease.

          (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the lessee and any mortgagee a cancellation letter by certified mail, return receipt requested within 5 business days of our decision. We will send a copy of the cancellation letter to the tribe for tribal land, and will provide Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land with actual or constructive notice of the cancellation. The cancellation letter will:

          (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

          (2) If applicable, notify the lessee of the amount of any unpaid rent or late payment charges due under the lease;

          (3) Notify the lessee of the lessee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter;

          (4) Order the lessee to vacate the property within 31 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time; and

          (5) Order the lessee to take any other action BIA deems necessary to protect the Indian landowners.

          (d) We may invoke any other remedies available to us under the lease, including collecting on any available performance bond, and the Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under tribal law.

          (e) We will ensure that any action we take is consistent with 25 U.S.C. 4137, as applicable.

          § 162.368   Will late payment charges or special fees apply to delinquent payments due under a residential lease?

#### § § 162.368

          (a) Late payment charges will apply as specified in the lease. The failure to pay these amounts will be treated as a lease violation.

          (b) We may assess the following special fees to cover administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of the debt, if rent is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to late payment charges that must be paid to the Indian landowners under the lease:

          § 162.369   How will payment rights relating to a residential lease be allocated?

#### § § 162.369

          The residential lease may allocate rights to payment for insurance proceeds, trespass damages, condemnation awards, settlement funds, and other payments between the Indian landowners and the lessee. If not specified in the lease, insurance policy, order, award, judgment, or other document, the Indian landowners will be entitled to receive these payments.

          § 162.370   When will a cancellation of a residential lease be effective?

#### § § 162.370

          (a) A cancellation involving a residential lease will not be effective until 31 days after the lessee receives a cancellation letter from us, or 41 days from the date we mailed the letter, whichever is earlier.

          (b) The cancellation decision will not be effective if an appeal is filed unless the cancellation is made immediately effective under part 2 of this chapter. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the lessee must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the lease.

          § 162.371   What will BIA do if a lessee remains in possession after a residential lease expires or is terminated or cancelled?

#### § § 162.371

          If a lessee remains in possession after the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a residential lease, we may treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass under applicable law in consultation with the Indian landowners. Unless the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 have notified us in writing that they are engaged in good faith negotiations with the holdover lessee to obtain a new lease, we may take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, such as a forcible entry and detainer action.

          § 162.372   Will BIA appeal bond regulations apply to cancellation decisions involving residential leases?

#### § § 162.372

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appeal bond provisions in part 2 of this chapter will apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions.

          (b) The lessee may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The lessee may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the appeal bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

          § 162.373   When will BIA issue a decision on an appeal from a residential leasing decision?

#### § § 162.373

          BIA will issue a decision on an appeal from a leasing decision within 30 days of receipt of all pleadings.

          § 162.374   What happens if the lessee abandons the leased premises?

#### § § 162.374

          If a lessee abandons the leased premises, we will treat the abandonment as a violation of the lease. The lease may specify a period of non-use after which the lease premises will be considered abandoned.

      Subpart D—Business Leases

**Source:** Source: 77 FR 72474, Dec. 5, 2012, unless otherwise noted.

        Business Leasing General Provisions

          § 162.401   What types of leases does this subpart cover?

#### § § 162.401

          (a) This subpart covers both ground leases (undeveloped land) and leases of developed land (together with the permanent improvements thereon) on Indian land that are not covered in another subpart of this part, including:

          (1) Leases for residential purposes that are not covered in subpart C;

          (2) Leases for business purposes that are not covered in subpart E;

          (3) Leases for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes; and

          (4) Commercial or industrial leases for retail, office, manufacturing, storage, biomass, waste-to-energy, or other business purposes.

          (b) Leases covered by this subpart may authorize the construction of single-purpose or mixed-use projects designed for use by any number of lessees or occupants.

          § 162.402   Is there a model business lease form?

#### § § 162.402

          There is no model business lease form because of the need for flexibility in negotiating and writing business leases; however, we may:

          (a) Provide other guidance, such as checklists and sample lease provisions, to assist in the lease negotiation process; and

          (b) Assist the Indian landowners, upon their request, in developing appropriate lease provisions or in using tribal lease forms that conform to the requirements of this part.

        Lease Requirements

          § 162.411   How long may the term of a business lease run?

#### § § 162.411

          (a) A business lease must provide for a definite term, state if there is an option to renew, and if so, provide for a definite term for the renewal period. The maximum term of a lease approved under 25 U.S.C. 415(a) may not exceed 50 years (consisting of an initial term not to exceed 25 years and one renewal not to exceed 25 years), unless a Federal statute provides for a longer maximum term (e.g., 25 U.S.C. 415(a) allows for a maximum term of 99 years for certain tribes), a different initial term, renewal term, or number of renewals.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the lease term, including any renewal, is reasonable. For individually owned Indian land, we will review the lease term, including any renewal, to ensure it is reasonable, given the:

          (1) Purpose of the lease;

          (2) Type of financing; and

          (3) Level of investment.

          (c) The lease may not be extended by holdover.

          § 162.412   What must the lease include if it contains an option to renew?

#### § § 162.412

          (a) If the lease provides for an option to renew, the lease must specify:

          (1) The time and manner in which the option must be exercised or is automatically effective;

          (2) That confirmation of the renewal will be submitted to us, unless the lease provides for automatic renewal;

          (3) Whether Indian landowner consent to the renewal is required;

          (4) That the lessee must provide notice of the renewal to the Indian landowners and any sureties and mortgagees;

          (5) The additional consideration, if any, that will be due upon the exercise of the option to renew or the start of the renewal term; and

          (6) Any other conditions for renewal (e.g., that the lessee not be in violation of the lease at the time of renewal).

          (b) We will record any renewal of a lease in the LTRO.

          § 162.413   Are there mandatory provisions that a business lease must contain?

#### § § 162.413

          (a) All business leases must identify:

          (1) The tract or parcel of land being leased;

          (2) The purpose of the lease and authorized uses of the leased premises;

          (3) The parties to the lease;

          (4) The term of the lease;

          (5) The ownership of permanent improvements and the responsibility for constructing, operating, maintaining, and managing permanent improvements under § 162.415;

          (6) Payment requirements and late payment charges, including interest;

          (7) Due diligence requirements under § 162.417 (unless the lease is for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes);

          (8) Insurance requirements under § 162.437; and

          (9) Bonding requirements under § 162.434. If a performance bond is required, the lease must state that the lessee must obtain the consent of the surety for any legal instrument that directly affects their obligations and liabilities.

          (b) Where a representative executes a lease on behalf of an Indian landowner or lessee, the lease must identify the landowner or lessee being represented and the authority under which the action is taken.

          (c) All business leases must include the following provisions:

          (1) The obligations of the lessee and its sureties to the Indian landowners are also enforceable by the United States, so long as the land remains in trust or restricted status;

          (2) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of the leased premises;

          (3) The lessee must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and other legal requirements under § 162.014;

          (4) If historic properties, archeological resources, human remains, or other cultural items not previously reported are encountered during the course of any activity associated with this lease, all activity in the immediate vicinity of the properties, resources, remains, or items will cease and the lessee will contact BIA and the tribe with jurisdiction over the land to determine how to proceed and appropriate disposition;

          (5) BIA has the right, at any reasonable time during the term of the lease and upon reasonable notice, in accordance with § 162.464, to enter the leased premises for inspection and to ensure compliance; and

          (6) BIA may, at its discretion, treat as a lease violation any failure by the lessee to cooperate with a BIA request to make appropriate records, reports, or information available for BIA inspection and duplication.

          (d) Unless the lessee would be prohibited by law from doing so, the lease must also contain the following provisions:

          (1) The lessee holds the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the lessee's use or occupation of the leased premises; and

          (2) The lessee indemnifies the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or the release or discharge of any hazardous material from the leased premises that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault, with the exception that the lessee is not required to indemnify the Indian landowners for liability or cost arising from the Indian landowners' negligence or willful misconduct.

          (e) We may treat any provision of a lease document that violates Federal law as a violation of the lease.

          § 162.414   May permanent improvements be made under a business lease?

#### § § 162.414

          The lessee may construct permanent improvements under a business lease if the business lease specifies, or provides for the development of:

          (a) A plan that describes the type and location of any permanent improvements to be constructed by the lessee; and

          (b) A general schedule for construction of the permanent improvements, including dates for commencement and completion of construction.

          § 162.415   How must a business lease address ownership of permanent improvements?

#### § § 162.415

          (a) A business lease must specify who will own any permanent improvements the lessee constructs during the lease term and may specify under what conditions, if any, permanent improvements the lessee constructs may be conveyed to the Indian landowners during the lease term. In addition, the lease must indicate whether each specific permanent improvement the lessee constructs will:

          (1) Remain on the leased premises, upon the expiration, cancellation, or termination of the lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners, and become the property of the Indian landowners;

          (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before construction of the permanent improvements; or

          (3) Be disposed of by other specified means.

          (b) A lease that requires the lessee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession of and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.

          § 162.416   How will BIA enforce removal requirements in a business lease?

#### § § 162.416

          (a) We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:

          (1) In consultation with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and

          (2) Before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease.

          (b) We may collect and hold the performance bond or alternative form of security until removal and restoration are completed.

          § 162.417   What requirements for due diligence must a business lease include?

#### § § 162.417

          (a) If permanent improvements are to be constructed, the business lease must include due diligence requirements that require the lessee to complete construction of any permanent improvements within the schedule specified in the lease or general schedule of construction, and a process for changing the schedule by mutual consent of the parties. If construction does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in the lease, the lessee must provide the Indian landowners and BIA with an explanation of good cause as to the nature of any delay, the anticipated date of construction of facilities, and evidence of progress toward commencement of construction.

          (b) Failure of the lessee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the lease is a violation of the lease and may lead to cancellation of the lease under § 162.467.

          (c) BIA may waive the requirements in this section if such waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          (d) The requirements of this section do not apply to leases for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes.

          § 162.418   How must a business lease describe the land?

#### § § 162.418

          (a) A business lease must describe the leased premises by reference to an official or certified survey, if possible. If the land cannot be so described, the lease must include one or more of the following:

          (1) A legal description;

          (2) A survey-grade global positioning system description; or

          (3) Another description prepared by a registered land surveyor that is sufficient to identify the leased premises.

          (b) If the tract is fractionated we will identify the undivided trust or restricted interests in the leased premises.

          § 162.419   May a business lease allow compatible uses?

#### § § 162.419

          A business lease may provide for the Indian landowners to use, or authorize others to use, the leased premises for other uses compatible with the purpose of the business lease and consistent with the terms of the business lease. Any such use or authorization by the Indian landowners will not reduce or offset the monetary compensation for the business lease.

        Monetary Compensation Requirements

          § 162.420   How much monetary compensation must be paid under a business lease of tribal land?

#### § § 162.420

          (a) A business lease of tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation if the tribe submits a tribal authorization expressly stating that it:

          (1) Has negotiated compensation satisfactory to the tribe;

          (2) Waives valuation; and

          (3) Has determined that accepting such negotiated compensation and waiving valuation is in its best interest.

          (b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market rental, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 162.422. After providing the tribe with the fair market rental, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the lease provide for fair market rental based on a valuation in accordance with § 162.422.

          § 162.421   How much monetary compensation must be paid under a business lease of individually owned Indian land?

#### § § 162.421

          (a) A business lease of individually owned Indian land must require payment of not less than fair market rental before any adjustments, based on a fixed amount, a percentage of the projected income, or some other method, unless paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section permit a lesser amount. The lease must establish how the fixed amount, percentage, or combination will be calculated and the frequency at which the payments will be made.

          (b) We may approve a lease of individually owned Indian land that provides for the payment of nominal compensation, or less than a fair market rental, if:

          (1) The Indian landowners execute a written waiver of the right to receive fair market rental; and

          (2) We determine it is in the Indian landowners' best interest, based on factors including, but not limited to:

          (i) The lessee is a member of the immediate family, as defined in § 162.003, of an individual Indian landowner;

          (ii) The lessee is a co-owner in the leased tract;

          (iii) A special relationship or circumstances exist that we believe warrant approval of the lease;

          (iv) The lease is for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes;

          (v) We have waived the requirement for a valuation under paragraph (e) of this section.

          (c) We may approve a lease that provides for payment of less than a fair market rental during the pre-development or construction periods, if we determine it is in the Indian landowners' best interest. The lease must specify the amount of the compensation and the applicable periods.

          (d) We will require a valuation in accordance with § 162.422, unless:

          (1) 100 percent of the Indian landowners submit to us a written request to waive the valuation requirement; or

          (2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (e) of this section.

          (e) If the owners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 of this part execute a business lease on behalf of all of the Indian landowners of a fractionated tract, the lease must provide that the non-consenting Indian landowners, and those on whose behalf we have consented, receive a fair market rental, as determined by a valuation, unless we waive the requirement because the tribe or lessee will construct infrastructure improvements on, or serving, the leased premises, and we determine it is in the best interest of all the landowners.

          § 162.422   How will BIA determine fair market rental for a business lease?

#### § § 162.422

          (a) We will use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine the fair market rental before we approve a business lease of individually owned Indian land or, at the request of the tribe, for tribal land.

          (b) We will either:

          (1) Prepare, or have prepared, a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method; or

          (2) Use an approved market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method from the Indian landowners or lessee.

          (c) We will use or approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method only if it:

          (1) Has been prepared in accordance with USPAP or a valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214; and

          (2) Complies with Departmental policies regarding appraisals, including third-party appraisals.

          (d) Indian landowners may use competitive bidding as a valuation method.

          § 162.423   When are monetary compensation payments due under a business lease?

#### § § 162.423

          (a) A business lease must specify the dates on which all payments are due.

          (b) Unless the lease provides otherwise, payments may not be made or accepted more than one year in advance of the due date.

          (c) Payments are due at the time specified in the lease, regardless of whether the lessee receives an advance billing or other notice that a payment is due.

          § 162.424   Must a business lease specify who receives monetary compensation payments?

#### § § 162.424

          (a) A business lease must specify whether the lessee will make payments directly to the Indian landowners (direct pay) or to us on their behalf.

          (b) The lessee may make payments directly to the Indian landowners if:

          (1) The Indian landowners' trust accounts are unencumbered;

          (2) There are 10 or fewer beneficial owners; and

          (3) One hundred percent of the beneficial owners (including those on whose behalf we have consented) agree to receive payment directly from the lessee at the start of the lease.

          (c) If the lease provides that the lessee will directly pay the Indian landowners, then:

          (1) The lease must include provisions for proof of payment upon our request.

          (2) When we consent on behalf of an Indian landowner, the lessee must make payment to us on behalf of that landowner.

          (3) The lessee must send direct payments to the parties and addresses specified in the lease, unless the lessee receives notice of a change of ownership or address.

          (4) Unless the lease provides otherwise, compensation payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (5) Direct payments must continue through the duration of the lease, except that:

          (i) The lessee must make all Indian landowners' payments to us if 100 percent of the Indian landowners agree to suspend direct pay and provide us with documentation of their agreement; and

          (ii) The lessee must make that individual Indian landowner's payment to us if any individual Indian landowner who dies, is declared non compos mentis, owes a debt resulting in a trust account encumbrance, or his or her whereabouts become unknown.

          § 162.425   What form of monetary compensation payment is acceptable under a business lease?

#### § § 162.425

          (a) When payments are made directly to Indian landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.

          (b) When payments are made to us, our preferred method of payment is electronic funds transfer payments. We will also accept:

          (1) Money orders;

          (2) Personal checks;

          (3) Certified checks; or

          (4) Cashier's checks.

          (c) We will not accept cash or foreign currency.

          (d) We will accept third-party checks only from financial institutions or Federal agencies.

          § 162.426   May the business lease provide for non-monetary or varying types of compensation?

#### § § 162.426

          (a) A lease may provide for the following, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

          (1) Alternative forms of compensation, including but not limited to, in-kind consideration and payments based on percentage of income; or

          (2) Varying types of compensation at specific stages during the life of the lease, including but not limited to fixed annual payments during construction, payments based on income during an operational period, and bonuses.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the compensation under paragraph (a) of this section is in its best interest, if the tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the compensation under paragraph (a) of this section to be in its best interest.

          (c) For individually owned land, we may approve a lease that provides for compensation under paragraph (a) of this section if we determine that it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          § 162.427   Will BIA notify a lessee when a payment is due under a business lease?

#### § § 162.427

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a lessee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under a business lease. The lessee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not issued, delivered, or received.

          § 162.428   Must a business lease provide for compensation reviews or adjustments?

#### § § 162.428

          (a) For a business lease of tribal land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of compensation or adjustment is required if the tribe states in its tribal certification or authorization that it has determined that not having compensation reviews and/or adjustments is in its best interest.

          (b) For a business lease of individually owned Indian land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of compensation or adjustment is required if:

          (1) If the term of the lease is 5 years or less;

          (2) The lease provides for automatic adjustments; or

          (3) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners not to require a review or automatic adjustment based on circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:

          (i) The lease provides for payment of less than fair market rental;

          (ii) The lease is for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes;

          (iii) The lease provides for most or all of the compensation to be paid during the first 5 years of the lease term or before the date the review would be conducted; or

          (iv) The lease provides for graduated rent or non-monetary or various types of compensation.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, a review of the adequacy of compensation must occur at least every fifth year, in the manner specified in the lease. The lease must specify:

          (1) When adjustments take effect;

          (2) Who can make adjustments;

          (3) What the adjustments are based on; and

          (4) How to resolve disputes arising from the adjustments.

          (d) When a review results in the need for adjustment of compensation, the Indian landowners must consent to the adjustment in accordance with § 162.012, unless the lease provides otherwise.

          § 162.429   What other types of payments are required under a business lease?

#### § § 162.429

          (a) The lessee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and assessments associated with the use of the land, as determined by entities having jurisdiction, except as provided in § 162.017. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office.

          (b) If the leased premises are within an Indian irrigation project or drainage district, except as otherwise provided in part 171 of this chapter, the lessee must pay all operation and maintenance charges that accrue during the lease term. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office in charge of the irrigation project or drainage district. We will treat failure to make these payments as a violation of the lease.

          (c) Where the property is subject to at least one other lease for another compatible use, the lessees may agree among themselves how to allocate payment of the Indian irrigation operation and maintenance charges.

        Bonding and Insurance

          § 162.434   Must a lessee provide a performance bond for a business lease?

#### § § 162.434

          The lessee must provide a performance bond or alternative form of security, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

          (a) The performance bond or alternative form of security must be in an amount sufficient to secure the contractual obligations including:

          (1) No less than:

          (i) The highest annual rental specified in the lease, if compensation is paid annually; or

          (ii) If the compensation is not paid annually, another amount established by BIA in consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land;

          (2) The construction of any required permanent improvements;

          (3) The operation and maintenance charges for any land located within an irrigation project; and

          (4) The restoration and reclamation of the leased premises, to their condition at the start of the lease term or some other specified condition.

          (b) The performance bond or other security:

          (1) Must be deposited with us and made payable only to us, and may not be modified without our approval, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

          (2) For tribal land, if the lease so provides, may be deposited with the tribe and made payable to the tribe, and may not be modified without the approval of the tribe.

          (c) The lease must specify the conditions under which we may adjust security or performance bond requirements to reflect changing conditions, including consultation with the tribal landowner for tribal land before the adjustment.

          (d) We may require that the surety provide any supporting documents needed to show that the performance bond or alternative forms of security will be enforceable, and that the surety will be able to perform the guaranteed obligations.

          (e) The performance bond or other security instrument must require the surety to provide notice to us at least 60 days before canceling a performance bond or other security. This will allow us to notify the lessee of its obligation to provide a substitute performance bond or other security and require collection of the bond or security before the cancellation date. Failure to provide a substitute performance bond or security is a violation of the lease.

          (f) We may waive the requirement for a performance bond or alternative form of security if either:

          (1) The lease is for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes; or

          (2) The Indian landowners request it and we determine a waiver is in the Indian landowners' best interest.

          (g) For tribal land, we will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver of a performance bond or alternative form of security is in its best interest.

          § 162.435   What forms of security are acceptable under a business lease?

#### § § 162.435

          (a) We will accept a performance bond only in one of the following forms:

          (1) Certificates of deposit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (2) Irrevocable letters of credit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (3) Negotiable Treasury securities; or

          (4) Surety bonds issued by a company approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

          (b) We may accept an alternative form of security approved by us that provides adequate protection for the Indian landowners and us, including but not limited to an escrow agreement and assigned savings account.

          (c) All forms of performance bonds or alternative security must, if applicable:

          (1) Indicate on their face that BIA approval is required for redemption;

          (2) Be accompanied by a statement granting full authority to BIA to make an immediate claim upon or sell them if the lessee violates the lease;

          (3) Be irrevocable during the term of the performance bond or alternative security; and

          (4) Be automatically renewable during the term of the lease.

          (d) We will not accept cash bonds.

          § 162.436   What is the release process for a performance bond or alternative form of security under a business lease?

#### § § 162.436

          (a) Upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease, the lessee may ask BIA in writing to release the performance bond or alternative form of security.

          (b) Upon receiving a request under paragraph (a) of this section, BIA will:

          (1) Confirm with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, that the lessee has complied with all lease obligations; and

          (2) Release the performance bond or alternative form of security to the lessee, unless we determine that the bond or security must be redeemed to fulfill the contractual obligations.

          § 162.437   Must a lessee provide insurance for a business lease?

#### § § 162.437

          Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lessee must provide insurance necessary to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and in the amount sufficient to protect all insurable permanent improvements on the premises.

          (a) The insurance may include property, crop, liability, and casualty insurance, depending on the Indian landowners' interests to be protected.

          (b) Both the Indian landowners and the United States must be identified as additional insured parties.

          (c) We may waive the requirement for insurance upon the request of the Indian landowner, if a waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowner, including if the lease is for less than fair market rental or nominal compensation. For tribal land, we will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver is in its best interest.

          (h) A restoration and reclamation plan (and any subsequent modifications to the plan), if appropriate;

          (i) Where the lessee is not an entity owned and operated by the tribe, documents that demonstrate the technical capability of the lessee or lessee's agent to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the proposed project and the lessee's ability to successfully design, construct, or obtain the funding for a project similar to the proposed project, if appropriate;

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we will review the proposed business lease after negotiation by the parties, before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation and any valuation. Within 60 days of receiving the proposed lease, we will provide an acknowledgement of the terms of the lease and identify any provisions that, based on this acknowledgment review, would justify disapproval of the lease, pending results of the NEPA review and any valuation.

          § 162.440   What is the approval process for a business lease?

#### § § 162.440

          (a) Before we approve a business lease, we must determine that the lease is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the lease and supporting documents;

          (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances;

          (2) If the business lease package is complete, we will notify the parties of the date of our receipt. Within 60 days of the receipt date, we will approve or disapprove the lease, return the package for revision, or inform the parties in writing that we need additional review time. If we inform the parties in writing that we need additional time, then:

          (i) Our letter informing the parties that we need additional review time must identify our initial concerns and invite the parties to respond within 15 days of the date of the letter; and

          (ii) We have 30 days from sending the letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the lease.

          (a) If a party appeals our decision on a lease, assignment, amendment, or sublease, then the official to whom the appeal is made may require the appellant to post an appeal bond in accordance with part 2 of this chapter. We will not require an appeal bond:

          (1) For an appeal of a decision on a leasehold mortgage; or

          (2) If the tribe is a party to the appeal and requests a waiver of the appeal bond.

We have 30 days from sending the letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the sublease.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadline in paragraph (a) of this section, or paragraph (b) of this section if applicable, the sublease is deemed approved to the extent consistent with Federal law. Unless the lease provides otherwise, provisions of the sublease that are inconsistent with Federal law will be severed and unenforceable; all other provisions of the sublease will remain in force.

          § 162.456   How will BIA decide whether to approve a sublease of a business lease?

#### § § 162.456

          (a) We may disapprove a sublease of a business lease only if at least one of the following is true:

          (1) The Indian landowners have not consented and their consent is required;

          (2) The lessee's mortgagees or sureties have not consented;

          (3) The lessee is in violation of the lease;

          (4) The lessee will not remain liable under the lease;

          (5) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (6) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, we may consider whether the value of any part of the leased premises not covered by the sublease would be adversely affected.

          (c) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the sublease is in their best interest.

          (d) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a sublease.

          (b) The Indian landowners, or their representatives under § 162.013, must consent to a leasehold mortgage of a business lease in the same percentages and manner as a new business lease under § 162.012, unless the lease:

          (1) States that landowner consent is not required for a leasehold mortgage and identifies what law would apply in case of foreclosure;

          (2) Provides that individual Indian landowners are deemed to have consented where they do not object in writing to the leasehold mortgage within a specified period of time following the landowners' receipt of the leasehold mortgage and the lease meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;

          (3) Authorizes one or more representatives to consent to a leasehold mortgage on behalf of all Indian landowners; or

          (4) Designates us as the Indian landowners' representative for the purposes of consenting to a leasehold mortgage.

          (c) If the lease provides for deemed consent under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it must require the parties to submit to us:

          (1) A copy of the executed leasehold mortgage or other documentation of any Indian landowners' actual consent;

          (2) Proof of mailing of the leasehold mortgage to any Indian landowners who are deemed to have consented; and

          (2) The lessee's mortgagees or sureties have not consented;

          (3) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (4) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, we may consider whether:

          (1) The leasehold mortgage proceeds would be used for purposes unrelated to the leased premises; and

          (2) The leasehold mortgage is limited to the leasehold.

          (c) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the leasehold mortgage is in their best interest.

        Effectiveness, Compliance, and Enforcement

          § 162.461   When will an amendment, assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage of a business lease be effective?

#### § § 162.461

          (a) An amendment, assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage of a business lease will be effective when approved, even if an appeal is filed under part 2 of this chapter, except:

          (1) If the amendment or sublease was deemed approved under § 162.447(c) or § 162.455(c), the amendment or sublease becomes effective 45 days from the date the parties mailed or delivered the document to us for our review or, if we sent a letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the lease, the amendment or sublease becomes effective 45 days from the date of the letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the lease; and

          (2) An assignment that does not require our approval under § 162.449(b) or § 162.449(c) or a sublease that does not require our approval under § 152.453(b) becomes effective on the effective date specified in the assignment or sublease. If the assignment or sublease does not specify the effective date, it becomes effective upon execution by the parties.

          (b) We will provide copies of approved documents to the party requesting approval, to the tribe for tribal land, and upon request, to other parties to the lease document.

          § 162.462   What happens if BIA disapproves an amendment, assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage of a business lease?

#### § § 162.462

          If we disapprove an amendment, assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage of a business lease, we will notify the parties immediately and advise the landowners of their right to appeal the decision under part 2 of this chapter.

          § 162.463   What happens if BIA does not meet a deadline for issuing a decision on a lease document?

#### § § 162.463

          (a) If a Superintendent does not meet a deadline for issuing a decision on a lease, assignment, or leasehold mortgage, the parties may file a written notice to compel action with the appropriate Regional Director.

          (b) The Regional Director has 15 days from receiving the notice to:

          (1) Issue a decision; or

          (2) Order the Superintendent to issue a decision within the time set out in the order.

          (c) The parties may file a written notice to compel action with the BIA Director if:

          (1) The Regional Director does not meet the deadline in paragraph (b) of this section;

          (2) The Superintendent does not issue a decision within the time set by the Regional Director under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

          (3) The initial decision on the lease, assignment, or leasehold mortgage is with the Regional Director, and he or she does not meet the deadline for such decision.

          (d) The BIA Director has 15 days from receiving the notice to:

          (1) Issue a decision; or

          (2) Order the Regional Director or Superintendent to issue a decision within the time set out in the order.

          (e) If the Regional Director or Superintendent does not issue a decision within the time set out in the order under paragraph (d)(2), then the BIA Director must issue a decision within 15 days from the expiration of the time set out in the order.

          (g) The provisions of 25 CFR 2.8 do not apply to the inaction of BIA officials with respect to a decision on a lease, amendment, assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage under this subpart.

          § 162.464   May BIA investigate compliance with a business lease?

#### § § 162.464

          (a) We may enter the leased premises at any reasonable time, upon reasonable notice, and consistent with any notice requirements under applicable tribal law and applicable lease documents, to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and to determine if the lessee is in compliance with the requirements of the lease.

          (b) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific lease violation has occurred, we will promptly initiate an appropriate investigation.

          § 162.465   May a business lease provide for negotiated remedies if there is a violation?

#### § § 162.465

          (a) A business lease of tribal land may provide either or both parties with negotiated remedies in the event of a lease violation, including, but not limited to, the power to terminate the lease. If the lease provides one or both parties with the power to terminate the lease:

          (1) BIA approval of the termination is not required;

          (2) The termination is effective without BIA cancellation; and

          (3) The Indian landowners must notify us of the termination so that we may record it in the LTRO.

          (b) A business lease of individually owned Indian land may provide either or both parties with negotiated remedies, so long as the lease also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 of this part. If the lease provides one or both parties with the power to terminate the lease:

          (1) BIA concurrence with the termination is required to ensure that the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests have consented; and

          (2) BIA will record the termination in the LTRO.

          (c) The parties must notify any surety or mortgagee of any violation that may result in termination and the termination of a business lease.

          (d) Negotiated remedies may apply in addition to, or instead of, the cancellation remedy available to us, as specified in the lease. The landowners may request our assistance in enforcing negotiated remedies.

          (e) A business lease may provide that lease violations will be addressed by a tribe, and that lease disputes will be resolved by a tribal court, any other court of competent jurisdiction, or by a tribal governing body in the absence of a tribal court, or through an alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing actions or proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us.

          § 162.466   What will BIA do about a violation of a business lease?

#### § § 162.466

          (a) In the absence of actions or proceedings described in § 162.465(e), or if it is not appropriate for us to defer to the actions or proceedings, we will follow the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

          (b) If we determine there has been a violation of the conditions of a business lease, other than a violation of payment provisions covered by paragraph (c) of this section, we will promptly send the lessee and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested.

          (1) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

          (2) The notice of violation will advise the lessee that, within 10 business days of the receipt of a notice of violation, the lessee must:

          (i) Cure the violation and notify us, and the tribe for tribal land, in writing that the violation has been cured;

          (ii) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred; or

          (iii) Request additional time to cure the violation.

          (3) The notice of violation may order the lessee to cease operations under the lease.

          (c) A lessee's failure to pay compensation in the time and manner required by a business lease is a violation of the lease, and we will issue a notice of violation in accordance with this paragraph.

          (1) We will send the lessees and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested:

          (i) Promptly following the date on which the payment was due, if the lease requires that payments be made to us; or

          (ii) Promptly following the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the Indian landowners, if the lease provides for payment directly to the Indian landowners.

          (2) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

          (3) The notice of violation will require the lessee to provide adequate proof of payment.

          (d) The lessee and its sureties will continue to be responsible for the obligations in the lease until the lease expires, or is terminated or cancelled.

          § 162.467   What will BIA do if the lessee does not cure a violation of a business lease on time?

#### § § 162.467

          (a) If the lessee does not cure a violation of a business lease within the required time period, or provide adequate proof of payment as required in the notice of violation, we will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether:

          (1) We should cancel the lease;

          (2) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the lease;

          (3) We should invoke other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including collection on any available performance bond or, for failure to pay compensation, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or

          (4) The lessee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

          (b) Following consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, we may take action to recover unpaid compensation and any associated late payment charges.

          (1) We do not have to cancel the lease or give any further notice to the lessee before taking action to recover unpaid compensation.

          (2) We may still take action to recover any unpaid compensation if we cancel the lease.

          (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the lessee and any surety and mortgagee a cancellation letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 5 business days of our decision. We will send a copy of the cancellation letter to the tribe for tribal land, and will provide Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land with actual or constructive notice of the cancellation. The cancellation letter will:

          (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

          (2) If applicable, notify the lessee of the amount of any unpaid compensation or late payment charges due under the lease;

          (3) Notify the lessee of the lessee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, including the possibility that the official to whom the appeal is made may require the lessee to post an appeal bond;

          (4) Order the lessee to vacate the property within 31 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time; and

          (5) Order the lessee to take any other action BIA deems necessary to protect the Indian landowners.

          (d) We may invoke any other remedies available to us under the lease, including collecting on any available performance bond, and the Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under tribal law.

          § 162.468   Will late payment charges or special fees apply to delinquent payments due under a business lease?

#### § § 162.468

          (a) Late payment charges will apply as specified in the lease. The failure to pay these amounts will be treated as a lease violation.

          (b) We may assess the following special fees to cover administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of the debt, if compensation is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to the late payment charges that must be paid to the Indian landowners under the lease:

          § 162.469   How will payment rights relating to a business lease be allocated?

#### § § 162.469

          The business lease may allocate rights to payment for insurance proceeds, trespass damages, condemnation awards, settlement funds, and other payments between the Indian landowners and the lessee. If not specified in the lease, insurance policy, order, award, judgment, or other document, the Indian landowners or lessees will be entitled to receive these payments.

          § 162.470   When will a cancellation of a business lease be effective?

#### § § 162.470

          (a) A cancellation involving a business lease will not be effective until 31 days after the lessee receives a cancellation letter from us, or 41 days from the date we mailed the letter, whichever is earlier.

          (b) The cancellation decision will not be effective if an appeal is filed unless the cancellation is made immediately effective under part 2 of this chapter. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the lessee must continue to pay compensation and comply with the other terms of the lease.

          § 162.471   What will BIA do if a lessee remains in possession after a business lease expires or is terminated or cancelled?

#### § § 162.471

          If a lessee remains in possession after the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a business lease, we may treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass under applicable law in consultation with the Indian landowners. Unless the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 have notified us in writing that they are engaged in good faith negotiations with the holdover lessee to obtain a new lease, we may take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, such as a forcible entry and detainer action.

          § 162.472   Will BIA appeal bond regulations apply to cancellation decisions involving business leases?

#### § § 162.472

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appeal bond provisions in part 2 of this chapter will apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions

          (b) The lessee may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The lessee may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the appeal bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

          § 162.473   When will BIA issue a decision on an appeal from a business leasing decision?

#### § § 162.473

          BIA will issue a decision on an appeal from a business leasing decision within 60 days of receipt of all pleadings.

          § 162.474   What happens if the lessee abandons the leased premises?

#### § § 162.474

          If a lessee abandons the leased premises, we will treat the abandonment as a violation of the lease. The lease may specify a period of non-use after which the lease premises will be considered abandoned.

      Subpart E—Wind and Solar Resource Leases

**Source:** Source: 77 FR 72494, Dec. 5, 2012, unless otherwise noted.

        General Provisions Applicable to WEELs and WSR Leases

          § 162.501   What types of leases does this subpart cover?

#### § § 162.501

          (a) This subpart covers:

          (1) Wind energy evaluation leases (WEELs), which are short-term leases that authorize possession of Indian land for the purpose of installing, operating, and maintaining instrumentation, and associated infrastructure, such as meteorological towers, to evaluate wind resources for electricity generation; and

          (2) Wind and solar resource (WSR) leases, which are leases that authorize possession of Indian land for the purpose of installing, operating, and maintaining instrumentation, facilities, and associated infrastructure, such as wind turbines and solar panels, to harness wind and/or solar energy to generate and supply electricity:

          (i) For resale on a for-profit or non-profit basis;

          (ii) To a utility grid serving the public generally; or

          (iii) To users within the local community (e.g., on and adjacent to a reservation).

          (b) If the generation of electricity is solely to support a use approved under subpart B, Agricultural Leases; subpart C, Residential Leases; or subpart D Business Leases (including religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes), for the same parcel of land, then the installation, operation, and maintenance of instrumentation, facilities, and associated infrastructure are governed by subpart B, C, or D, as appropriate.

          § 162.502   Who must obtain a WEEL or WSR lease?

#### § § 162.502

          (a) Anyone seeking to possess Indian land to conduct activities associated with the evaluation of wind resources must obtain a WEEL, except that a WEEL is not required if use or possession of the Indian land to conduct wind energy evaluation activities is authorized:

          (1) Under § 162.005(b);

          (2) By a permit from the Indian landowners under § 162.007; or

          (3) By a tribe on its land under 25 U.S.C. 81.

          (b) Except as provided in §§ 162.005(b), 162.501, and paragraph (c) of this section, anyone seeking to possess Indian land to conduct activities associated with the development of wind and/or solar resources must obtain a WSR lease.

          (c) A tribe that conducts wind and solar resource activities on its tribal land does not need a WEEL or WSR under this subpart.

          § 162.503   Is there a model WEEL or WSR lease?

#### § § 162.503

          There is no model WEEL or WSR lease because of the need for flexibility in negotiating and writing WEELs and WSR leases; however, we may:

          (a) Provide other guidance, such as checklists and sample lease provisions, to assist in the lease negotiation process; and

          (b) Assist the Indian landowners, upon their request, in developing appropriate lease provisions or in using tribal lease forms that conform to the requirements of this part.

        WEELs

          § 162.511   What is the purpose of a WEEL?

#### § § 162.511

          A WEEL is a short-term lease that allows the lessee to possess trust or restricted lands for the purpose of evaluating wind resources. The lessee may use information collected under the WEEL to assess the potential for wind energy development, and determine future placement and type of wind energy technology to use in developing the energy resource potential of the leased area.

          § 162.512   How long may the term of a WEEL run?

#### § § 162.512

          (a) A WEEL must provide for a definite term, state if there is an option to renew and if so, provide for a definite term for the renewal period. WEELs are for project evaluation purposes, and therefore may have:

          (1) An initial term that is no longer than 3 years; and

          (2) One renewal period not to exceed 3 years.

          (b) The exercise of the option to renew must be in writing and the WEEL must specify:

          (1) The time and manner in which the option must be exercised or is automatically effective;

          (2) That confirmation of the renewal will be submitted to us, unless the WEEL provides for automatic renewal; and

          (3) Additional consideration, if any, that will be due upon the exercise of the option to renew or the start of the renewal term.

          § 162.513   Are there mandatory provisions a WEEL must contain?

#### § § 162.513

          (a) All WEELs must identify:

          (4) The term of the WEEL;

          (5) The ownership of permanent improvements and the responsibility for constructing, operating, maintaining, and managing permanent improvements, under § 162.515;

          (6) Payment requirements and late payment charges, including interest;

          (7) Due diligence requirements, under § 162.517; and

          (8) Insurance requirements, under § 162.527.

          (b) Where a representative executes a lease on behalf of an Indian landowner or lessee, the lease must identify the landowner or lessee being represented and the authority under which the action is taken.

          (c) All WEELs must include the following provisions:

          (1) The obligations of the lessee and its sureties to the Indian landowners are also enforceable by the United States, so long as the land remains in trust or restricted status;

          (2) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of leased premises;

          (3) The lessee must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and other legal requirements under § 162.014;

          (4) If historic properties, archeological resources, human remains, or other cultural items, not previously reported are encountered during the course of any activity associated with this lease, all activity in the immediate vicinity of the properties, resources, remains, or items will cease, and the lessee will contact BIA and the tribe with jurisdiction to determine how to proceed and appropriate disposition;

          (5) BIA has the right, at any reasonable time during the term of the lease, and upon reasonable notice, in accordance with § 162.589, to enter the leased premises for inspection; and

          (6) BIA may, at its discretion, treat as a lease violation any failure by the lessee to cooperate with a BIA request to make appropriate records, reports, or information available for BIA inspection and duplication.

          (d) Unless the lessee would be prohibited by law from doing so, the lease must also contain the following provisions:

          (1) The lessee holds the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the lessee's use or occupation of the leased premises;

          (2) The lessee indemnifies the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or the release or discharge of any hazardous material from the leased premises that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault, with the exception that the lessee is not required to indemnify the Indian landowners for liability or cost arising from the Indian landowners' negligence or willful misconduct.

          (e) We may treat any provision of a lease document that violates Federal law as a violation of the lease.

          § 162.514   May permanent improvements be made under a WEEL?

#### § § 162.514

          (a) A WEEL anticipates the installation of facilities and associated infrastructure of a size and magnitude necessary for evaluation of wind resource capacity and potential effects of development. These facilities and associated infrastructure are considered permanent improvements. An equipment installation plan must be submitted with the lease under § 162.528(g).

          (b) If any of the following changes are made to the equipment installation plan, the Indian landowners must approve the revised plan and the lessee must provide a copy of the revised plan to BIA:

          (1) Location of permanent improvements;

          (2) Type of permanent improvements; or

          (3) Delay of 90 days or more in any phase of development.

          § 162.515   How must a WEEL address ownership of permanent improvements?

#### § § 162.515

          (a) A WEEL must specify who will own any permanent improvements the lessee installs during the lease term. In addition, the WEEL must indicate whether any permanent improvements the lessee installs:

          (1) Will remain on the premises upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease whether or not the WEEL is followed by a WSR lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners;

          (2) May be conveyed to the Indian landowners during the WEEL term and under what conditions the permanent improvements may be conveyed;

          (3) Will be removed within a time period specified in the WEEL, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before installation of the permanent improvements; or

          (4) Will be disposed of by other specified means.

          (b) A WEEL that requires the lessee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.

          § 162.516   How will BIA enforce removal requirements in a WEEL?

#### § § 162.516

          We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:

          (a) In consultation with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and

          (b) After termination, cancellation, or expiration of the WEEL.

          § 162.517   What requirements for due diligence must a WEEL include?

#### § § 162.517

          (a) A WEEL must include due diligence requirements that require the lessee to:

          (1) Install testing and monitoring facilities within 12 months after the effective date of the WEEL or other period designated in the WEEL and consistent with the plan of development; and

          (2) If installation does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provide the Indian landowners and BIA with an explanation of good cause for any delay, the anticipated date of installation of facilities, and evidence of progress toward installing or completing testing and monitoring facilities.

          (b) Failure of the lessee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the WEEL is a violation of the WEEL and may lead to:

          (1) Cancellation of the WEEL under § 162.592; and

          (2) Application of the requirement that the lessee transfer ownership of energy resource information collected under the WEEL to the Indian landowners under § 162.520.

          § 162.518   How must a WEEL describe the land?

#### § § 162.518

          (a) A WEEL must describe the leased premises by reference to a public or private survey, if possible. If the land cannot be so described, the lease must include one or more of the following:

          (1) A legal description;

          (2) A survey-grade global positioning system description; or

          (3) Another description prepared by a registered land surveyor that is sufficient to identify the leased premises.

          (b) If the tract is fractionated, we will identify the undivided trust or restricted interests in the leased premises.

          § 162.519   May a WEEL allow for compatible uses by the Indian landowner?

#### § § 162.519

          The WEEL may provide for the Indian landowners to use, or authorize others to use, the leased premises for other noncompeting uses compatible with the purpose of the WEEL. This may include the right to lease the premises for other compatible purposes. Any such use by the Indian landowners will not reduce or offset the monetary compensation for the WEEL.

          § 162.520   Who owns the energy resource information obtained under the WEEL?

#### § § 162.520

          (a) The WEEL must specify the ownership of any energy resource information the lessee obtains during the WEEL term.

          (b) Unless otherwise specified in the WEEL, the energy resource information the lessee obtains through the leased activity becomes the property of Indian landowners at the expiration, termination, or cancellation of the WEEL or upon failure by the lessee to diligently install testing and monitoring facilities on the leased premises in accordance with § 162.517.

          (c) BIA will keep confidential any information it is provided that is marked confidential or proprietary and that is exempt from public release, to the extent allowed by law.

          § 162.521   May a lessee incorporate its WEEL analyses into its WSR lease analyses?

#### § § 162.521

          Any analyses a lessee uses to bring a WEEL activity into compliance with applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations under § 162.014 and any other legal requirements may be incorporated by reference, as appropriate, into the analyses of a proposed WSR lease.

          § 162.522   May a WEEL contain an option for the lessee to enter into a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.522

          (a) A WEEL may provide for an option period following the expiration of the WEEL term during which the lessee and the Indian landowners may enter into a WSR lease.

          (b) Our approval of a WEEL that contains an option to enter into a WSR lease does not guarantee or imply our approval of any WSR lease.

        WEEL Monetary Compensation Requirements

          § 162.523   How much compensation must be paid under a WEEL?

#### § § 162.523

          (a) The WEEL must state how much compensation will be paid.

          (b) A WEEL must specify the date on which compensation will be due.

          (c) Failure to make timely payments is a violation of the WEEL and may lead to cancellation of the WEEL.

          (d) The lease compensation requirements of §§ 162.552 through 162.558 also apply to WEELs.

          § 162.524   Will BIA require a valuation for a WEEL?

#### § § 162.524

          We will not require a valuation for a WEEL.

        WEEL Bonding and Insurance

          § 162.525   Must a lessee provide a performance bond for a WEEL?

#### § § 162.525

          We will not require the lessee to provide a performance bond or alternative form of security for a WEEL.

          § 162.526   [Reserved]

#### § § 162.526

          § 162.527   Must a lessee provide insurance for a WEEL?

#### § § 162.527

          Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a lessee must provide insurance necessary to protect the interests of Indian landowners and in the amount sufficient to protect all insurable permanent improvements on the leased premises.

          (a) The insurance may include property, crop, liability, and casualty insurance, depending on the Indian landowners' interests to be protected.

          (b) Both the Indian landowners and the United States must be identified as additional insured parties.

          (c) Lease insurance may be increased and extended for use as the required WSR lease insurance.

          (d) We may waive the requirement for insurance upon the request of the Indian landowner, if a waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowner, including if the lease is for less than fair market rental or nominal compensation. For tribal land, we will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver is in its best interest.

        WEEL Approval

          § 162.528   What documents are required for BIA approval of a WEEL?

#### § § 162.528

          A lessee or the Indian landowners must submit the following documents to us to obtain BIA approval of a WEEL:

          (a) A WEEL executed by the Indian landowners and the lessee that meets the requirements of this part;

          (b) For tribal land, a tribal authorization for the WEEL;

          (c) Proof of insurance, as required by § 162.527;

          (d) Statement from the appropriate tribal authority that the proposed use is in conformance with applicable tribal law, if required by the tribe;

          (e) Environmental and archeological reports, surveys, and site assessments as needed to facilitate compliance with applicable Federal and tribal environmental and land use requirements, including any documentation prepared under § 162.027(b);

          (f) An equipment installation plan;

          (g) A restoration and reclamation plan (and any subsequent modifications to the plan);

          (h) Where the lessee is not an entity owned and operated by the tribe, documents that demonstrate the technical capability of the lessee or lessee's agent to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the proposed project and the lessee's ability to successfully design, construct, or obtain the funding for a project similar to the proposed project, if appropriate;

          (i) A legal description of the land under § 162.518;

          (j) If the lease is being approved under 25 U.S.C. 415, information to assist us in our evaluation of the factors in 25 U.S.C. 415(a); and

          (k) If the lessee is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, or other legal entity, except a tribal entity, information such as organizational documents, certificates, filing records, and resolutions, that demonstrates that:

          (1) The representative has authority to execute a lease;

          (2) The lease will be enforceable against the lessee; and

          (3) The legal entity is in good standing and authorized to conduct business in the jurisdiction where the land is located.

          § 162.529   Will BIA review a proposed WEEL before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation?

#### § § 162.529

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we will review the proposed WEEL after negotiation by the parties, before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation. Within 10 days of receiving the proposed WEEL, we will provide an acknowledgement of the terms of the lease and identify any provisions that, based on this acknowledgment review, would justify disapproval of the lease, pending results of the NEPA review.

          § 162.530   What is the approval process for a WEEL?

#### § § 162.530

          (a) Before we approve a WEEL, we must determine that the WEEL is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the WEEL and supporting documents;

          (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances;

          (3) If the lease is being approved under 25 U.S.C. 415, assure ourselves that adequate consideration has been given to the factors in 25 U.S.C. 415(a); and

          (4) Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures necessary to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land use requirements.

          (b) Upon receiving the WEEL package, we will promptly notify the parties whether the package is or is not complete. A complete package includes all the information and supporting documents required for a WEEL, including but not limited to, NEPA review documentation, where applicable.

          (1) If the WEEL package is not complete, our letter will identify the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If we do not respond to the submission of a WEEL package, the parties may take action under § 162.588.

          (2) If the WEEL package is complete, we will notify the parties of the date we receive the complete package, and, within 20 days of the date of receipt of the package at the appropriate BIA office, approve or disapprove the WEEL or return the package for revision.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadline in this section, then the parties may take appropriate action under § 162.588.

          (d) We will provide any WEEL approval determination and the basis for the determination, along with notification of appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter, in writing to the parties to the WEEL.

          (e) We will provide any WEEL disapproval determination and the basis for the determination, along with notification of rights to an informal conference, in writing to the parties. Within 30 days of receipt of the disapproval determination, the parties may request an informal conference with the official who issued the determination. Within 30 days of receiving this request, the official must hold the informal conference with the parties. Within 10 days of the informal conference, the official must issue a decision and the basis for the decision, along with a notification of appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter, in writing to the parties to the WEEL.

          (f) We will provide the approved WEEL on tribal land to the lessee and provide a copy to the tribe. We will provide the approved WEEL on individually owned Indian land to the lessee, and make copies available to the Indian landowners upon written request.

          § 162.531   How will BIA decide whether to approve a WEEL?

#### § § 162.531

          (a) We will approve a WEEL unless:

          (1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the WEEL;

          (2) The requirements applicable to WEELs have not been met; or

          (3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the WEEL is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a WEEL.

          § 162.532   When will a WEEL be effective?

#### § § 162.532

          (a) A WEEL will be effective on the date on which we approve the WEEL, even if an appeal is filed under part 2 of this chapter.

          (b) The WEEL may specify a date on which the obligations between the parties to a WEEL are triggered. Such date may be before or after the approval date under paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c) WEEL lease documents not requiring our approval are effective upon execution by the parties, or on the effective date specified in the lease document. If the WEEL lease document does not specify an effective date, it becomes effective upon execution by the parties.

          § 162.533   Must a WEEL lease document be recorded?

#### § § 162.533

          (a) Any WEEL lease document must be recorded in our LTRO with jurisdiction over the leased land.

          (1) We will record the lease document immediately following our approval.

          (2) If our approval of an assignment or sublease is not required, the parties must record the assignment or sublease in the LTRO with jurisdiction over the leased land.

          (b) The tribe must record lease documents for the following types of leases in the LTRO with jurisdiction over the tribal lands, even though BIA approval is not required:

          (1) Leases of tribal land that a corporate entity leases to a third party under 25 U.S.C. 477; and

          (2) Leases of tribal land under a special act of Congress authorizing leases without our approval.

        WEEL Administration

          § 162.534   May the parties amend, assign, sublease, or mortgage a WEEL?

#### § § 162.534

          The parties may amend, assign, sublease, or mortgage a WEEL by following the procedures and requirements for amending, assigning, subleasing, or mortgaging a WSR lease.

          § 162.535   What effectiveness, compliance, and enforcement provisions apply to WEELs?

#### § § 162.535

          (a) The provisions at § 162.586 apply to WEEL lease documents.

          (b) The provisions at §§ 162.587 through 162.589 and 162.591 through 162.599 apply to WEELs, except that any references to § 162.590 will apply instead to § 162.536.

          § 162.536   Under what circumstances may a WEEL be terminated?

#### § § 162.536

          A WEEL must state whether, and under what conditions, the Indian landowners may terminate the WEEL.

          § 162.537   [Reserved]

#### § § 162.537

        WSR Leases

          § 162.538   What is the purpose of a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.538

          A WSR lease authorizes a lessee to possess Indian land to conduct activities related to the installation, operation, and maintenance of wind and/or solar energy resource development projects. Activities include installing instrumentation facilities and infrastructure associated with the generation, transmission, and storage of electricity and other related activities. Leases for biomass or waste-to-energy purposes are governed by subpart D of this part.

          § 162.539   Must I obtain a WEEL before obtaining a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.539

          You may enter into a WSR lease without a WEEL. While you may enter into a lease as a direct result of energy resource information gathered from a WEEL activity, obtaining a WEEL is not a precondition to entering into a WSR lease.

          § 162.540   How long may the term of a WSR lease run?

#### § § 162.540

          (a) A WSR lease must provide for a definite lease term, state if there is an option to renew, and if so, provide for a definite term for the renewal period. The maximum term of a lease approved under 25 U.S.C. 415(a) may not exceed 50 years (consisting of an initial term not to exceed 25 years and one renewal not to exceed 25 years), unless a Federal statute provides for a longer maximum term (e.g., 25 U.S.C. 415(a) allows for a maximum term of 99 years for certain tribes), a different initial term, renewal term, or number of renewals.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the lease term, including any renewal, is reasonable. For individually owned Indian land, we will review the lease term, including any renewal, to ensure it is reasonable, given the:

          (1) Purpose of the lease;

          (2) Type of financing; and

          (3) Level of investment.

          (c) The lease may not be extended by holdover.

          § 162.541   What must the lease include if it contains an option to renew?

#### § § 162.541

          (a) If the lease provides for an option to renew, the lease must specify:

          (1) The time and manner in which the option must be exercised or is automatically effective;

          (2) That confirmation of the renewal will be submitted to us, unless the lease provides for automatic renewal;

          (3) Whether Indian landowner consent to the renewal is required;

          (4) That the lessee must provide notice of the renewal to the Indian landowners and any sureties and mortgagees;

          (5) The additional consideration, if any, that will be due upon the exercise of the option to renew or the start of the renewal term; and

          (6) Any other conditions for renewal (e.g., that the lessee not be in violation of the lease at the time of renewal).

          (b) We will record any renewal of a lease in the LTRO.

          § 162.542   Are there mandatory provisions a WSR lease must contain?

#### § § 162.542

          (a) All WSR leases must identify:

          (1) The tract or parcel of land being leased;

          (2) The purpose of the lease and authorized uses of the leased premises;

          (3) The parties to the lease;

          (4) The term of the lease;

          (5) The ownership of permanent improvements and the responsibility for constructing, operating, maintaining, and managing, WSR equipment, roads, transmission lines and related facilities under § 162.543;

          (6) Who is responsible for evaluating the leased premises for suitability; purchasing, installing, operating, and maintaining WSR equipment; negotiating power purchase agreements; and transmission;

          (7) Payment requirements and late payment charges, including interest;

          (8) Due diligence requirements, under § 162.546;

          (9) Insurance requirements, under § 162.562; and

          (10) Bonding requirements under § 162.559. If a performance bond is required, the lease must state that the lessee must obtain the consent of the surety for any legal instrument that directly affects their obligations and liabilities.

          (b) Where a representative executes a lease on behalf of an Indian landowner or lessee, the lease must identify the landowner or lessee being represented and the authority under which such action is taken.

          (c) All WSR leases must include the following provisions:

          (1) The obligations of the lessee and its sureties to the Indian landowners are also enforceable by the United States, so long as the land remains in trust or restricted status;

          (2) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of the leased premises;

          (3) The lessee must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and other legal requirements under § 162.014;

          (4) If historic properties, archeological resources, human remains, or other cultural items not previously reported are encountered during the course of any activity associated with the lease, all activity in the immediate vicinity of the properties, resources, remains, or items will cease and the lessee will contact BIA and the tribe with jurisdiction to determine how to proceed and appropriate disposition;

          (5) BIA has the right, at any reasonable time during the term of the lease and upon reasonable notice, in accordance with § 162.589, to enter the leased premises for inspection and to ensure compliance; and

          (6) BIA may, at its discretion, treat as a lease violation any failure by the lessee to cooperate with a BIA request to make appropriate records, reports, or information available for BIA inspection and duplication.

          (d) Unless the lessee would be prohibited by law from doing so, the lease must also contain the following provisions:

          (1) The lessee holds the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the lessee's use or occupation of the leased premises; and

          (2) The lessee indemnifies the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or the release or discharge of any hazardous material from the leased premises that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault, with the exception that the lessee is not required to indemnify the Indian landowners for liability or cost arising from the Indian landowners' negligence or willful misconduct.

          (e) We may treat any provision of a lease document that violates Federal law as a violation of the lease.

          § 162.543   May permanent improvements be made under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.543

          (a) A WSR lease must provide for the installation of a facility and associated infrastructure of a size and magnitude necessary for the generation and delivery of electricity, in accordance with § 162.019. These facilities and associated infrastructure are considered permanent improvements. A resource development plan must be submitted for approval with the lease under § 162.563(h).

          (b) If the parties agree to any of the following changes to the resource development plan after lease approval, they must submit the revised plan to BIA for the file:

          (1) Location of permanent improvements;

          (2) Type of permanent improvements; or

          (3) Delay of 90 days or more in any phase of development.

          § 162.544   How must a WSR lease address ownership of permanent improvements?

#### § § 162.544

          (a) A WSR lease must specify who will own any permanent improvements the lessee installs during the lease term and may specify under what conditions, if any, permanent improvements the lessee constructs may be conveyed to the Indian landowners during the lease term. In addition, the lease must indicate whether each specific permanent improvement the lessee installs will:

          (1) Remain on the leased premises upon the expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners and become the property of the Indian landowners;

          (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before installation of the permanent improvements; or

          (3) Be disposed of by other specified means.

          (b) A lease that requires the lessee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession of and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.

          § 162.545   How will BIA enforce removal requirements in a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.545

          (a) We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:

          (1) In consultation with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and

          (2) Before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease.

          (b) We may collect and hold the performance bond until removal and restoration are completed.

          § 162.546   What requirements for due diligence must a WSR lease include?

#### § § 162.546

          (a) A WSR lease must include due diligence requirements that require the lessee to:

          (1) Commence installation of energy facilities within 2 years after the effective date of the lease or consistent with a timeframe in the resource development plan;

          (2) If installation does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provide the Indian landowners and BIA with an explanation of good cause as to the nature of any delay, the anticipated date of installation of facilities, and evidence of progress toward commencement of installation;

          (3) Maintain all on-site electrical generation equipment and facilities and related infrastructure in accordance with the design standards in the resource development plan; and

          (4) Repair, place into service, or remove from the site within a time period specified in the lease any idle, improperly functioning, or abandoned equipment or facilities that have been inoperative for a continuous period specified in the lease (unless the equipment or facilities were idle as a result of planned suspension of operations, for example, for grid operations or during bird migration season).

          (b) Failure of the lessee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the lease is a violation of the lease and may lead to cancellation of the lease under § 162.592.

          § 162.547   How must a WSR lease describe the land?

#### § § 162.547

          (a) A WSR lease must describe the leased premises by reference to a private or public survey, if possible. If the land cannot be so described, the lease must include one or more of the following:

          (1) A legal description;

          (2) A survey-grade global positioning system description; or

          (3) Another description prepared by a registered land surveyor that is sufficient to identify the leased premises.

          (b) If the tract is fractionated, we will identify the undivided trust or restricted interests in the leased premises.

          § 162.548   May a WSR lease allow compatible uses?

#### § § 162.548

          The lease may provide for the Indian landowners to use, or authorize others to use, the leased premises for other uses compatible with the purpose of the WSR lease and consistent with the terms of the WSR lease. This may include the right to lease the premises for other compatible purposes. Any such use or authorization by the Indian landowners will not reduce or offset the monetary compensation for the WSR lease.

        WSR Lease Monetary Compensation Requirements

          § 162.549   How much monetary compensation must be paid under a WSR lease of tribal land?

#### § § 162.549

          (a) A WSR lease of tribal land may allow for any payment negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation if the tribe submits a tribal authorization expressly stating that it:

          (1) Has negotiated compensation satisfactory to the tribe;

          (2) Waives valuation; and

          (3) Has determined that accepting such negotiated compensation and waiving valuation is in its best interest.

          (b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market rental, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 162.551. After providing the tribe with the fair market rental, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the lease provide for fair market rental based on a valuation in accordance with § 162.551.

          § 162.550   How much monetary compensation must be paid under a WSR lease of individually owned Indian land?

#### § § 162.550

          (a) A WSR lease of individually owned Indian land must require payment of not less than fair market rental before any adjustments, based on a fixed amount, a percentage of the projected gross income, megawatt capacity fee, or some other method, unless paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section permit a lesser amount. The lease must establish how the fixed amount, percentage or combination will be calculated and the frequency at which the payments will be made.

          (b) We may approve a lease of individually owned Indian land that provides for the payment of nominal compensation, or less than a fair market rental, if:

          (1) The Indian landowners execute a written waiver of the right to receive fair market rental; and

          (2) We determine it is in the Indian landowners' best interest, based on factors including, but not limited to:

          (i) The lessee is a member of the immediate family, as defined in § 162.003, of an Indian landowner;

          (ii) The lessee is a co-owner of the leased tract;

          (iii) A special relationship or circumstances exist that we believe warrant approval of the lease;

          (iv) The lease is for public purposes; or

          (v) We have waived the requirement for a valuation under paragraph (e) of this section.

          (c) We may approve a lease that provides for the payment of less than a fair market rental during the periods before the generation and transmission of electricity begins, if we determine it is in the Indian landowners' best interest. The lease must specify the amount of the compensation and the applicable periods.

          (d) We will require a valuation in accordance with § 162.422, unless:

          (1) 100 percent of the landowners submit to us a written request to waive the valuation requirement; or

          (2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (e) of this section; or

          (3) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners to accept an economic analysis in lieu of an appraisal and:

          (i) The Indian landowners submit an economic analysis that is approved by the Office of Indian Energy & Economic Development (IEED); or

          (ii) IEED prepares an economic analysis at the request of the Indian landowners.

          (e) If the owners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.011 of this part grant a WSR lease on behalf of all of the Indian landowners of a fractionated tract, the lease must provide that the non-consenting Indian landowners, and those on whose behalf we have consented, receive a fair market rental, as determined by a valuation, unless we waive the requirement because the tribe or lessee will construct infrastructure improvements on, or serving, the leased premises, and we determine it is in the best interest of all the landowners.

          § 162.551   How will BIA determine fair market rental for a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.551

          (a) We will use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine the fair market rental before we approve a WSR lease of individually owned Indian land or, at the request of the tribe, for tribal land.

          (b) We will either:

          (1) Prepare, or have prepared, a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method; or

          (2) Use an approved market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method from the Indian landowners or lessee.

          (c) We will use or approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method only if it:

          (1) Has been prepared in accordance with USPAP or a valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214; and

          (2) Complies with Department policies regarding appraisals, including third-party appraisals.

          (d) Indian landowners may use competitive bidding as a valuation method.

          § 162.552   When are monetary compensation payments due under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.552

          (a) A WSR lease must specify the dates on which all payments are due.

          (b) Unless the lease provides otherwise, payments may not be made or accepted more than one year in advance of the due date.

          (c) Payments are due at the time specified in the lease, regardless of whether the lessee receives an advance billing or other notice that a payment is due.

          § 162.553   Must a WSR lease specify who receives monetary compensation payments?

#### § § 162.553

          (a) A WSR lease must specify whether the lessee will make payments directly to the Indian landowners (direct pay) or to us on their behalf.

          (b) The lessee may make payments directly to the Indian landowners if:

          (1) The Indian landowners' trust accounts are unencumbered;

          (2) There are 10 or fewer beneficial owners; and

          (3) One hundred percent of the beneficial owners (including those on whose behalf we have consented) agree to receive payment directly from the lessee at the start of the lease.

          (c) If the lease provides that the lessee will directly pay the Indian landowners, then:

          (1) The lease must include provisions for proof of payment upon our request.

          (2) When we consent on behalf of an Indian landowner, the lessee must make payment to us on behalf of that landowner.

          (3) The lessee must send direct payments to the parties and addresses specified in the lease, unless the lessee receives notice of a change of ownership or address.

          (4) Unless the lease provides otherwise, payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (5) Direct payments must continue through the duration of the lease, except that:

          (i) The lessee must make all Indian landowners' payments to us if 100 percent of the Indian landowners agree to suspend direct pay and provide us with documentation of their agreement; and

          (ii) The lessee must make that individual Indian landowner's payment to us if any individual Indian landowner who dies, is declared non compos mentis, owes a debt resulting in a trust account encumbrance, or his or her whereabouts become unknown.

          § 162.554   What form of monetary compensation payment is acceptable under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.554

          (a) When payments are made directly to Indian landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.

          (b) When payments are made to us, our preferred method of payment is electronic funds transfer payments. We will also accept:

          (1) Money orders;

          (2) Personal checks;

          (3) Certified checks; or

          (4) Cashier's checks.

          (c) We will not accept cash or foreign currency.

          (d) We will accept third-party checks only from financial institutions or Federal agencies.

          § 162.555   May a WSR lease provide for non-monetary or varying types of compensation?

#### § § 162.555

          (a) A WSR lease may provide for the following, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

          (1) Alternative forms of compensation, including but not limited to, in-kind consideration and payments based on percentage of income; or

          (2) Varying types of consideration at specific stages during the life of the lease, including but not limited to fixed annual payments during installation, payments based on income during an operational period, and bonuses.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the compensation in paragraph (a) of this section is in its best interest, if the tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the compensation in paragraph (a) of this section to be in its best interest.

          (c) For individually owned land, we may approve a lease that provides for compensation under paragraph (a) of this section if we determine that it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          § 162.556   Will BIA notify a lessee when a payment is due under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.556

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a lessee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under a WSR lease. The lessee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not delivered or received.

          § 162.557   Must a WSR lease provide for compensation reviews or adjustments?

#### § § 162.557

          (a) For a WSR lease of tribal land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of compensation or adjustment is required if the tribe states in its tribal certification or authorization that it has determined that not having reviews and/or adjustments is in its best interest.

          (b) For a WSR lease of individually owned Indian land, unless the lease provides otherwise, no periodic review of the adequacy of compensation or adjustment is required if:

          (1) If the term of the lease is 5 years or less;

          (2) The lease provides for automatic adjustments; or

          (3) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners not to require a review or automatic adjustment based on circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:

          (i) The lease provides for payment of less than fair market rental;

          (ii) The lease is for public purposes;

          (iii) The lease provides for most or all of the compensation to be paid during the first 5 years of the lease term or before the date the review would be conducted; or

          (iv) The lease provides for graduated rent or non-monetary or various types of compensation.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, a review of the adequacy of compensation must occur at least every fifth year, in the manner specified in the lease. The lease must specify:

          (1) When adjustments take effect;

          (2) Who can make adjustments;

          (3) What the adjustments are based on; and

          (4) How to resolve disputes arising from the adjustments.

          (d) When a review results in the need for adjustment of compensation, the Indian landowners must consent to the adjustment in accordance with § 162.012, unless the lease provides otherwise.

          § 162.558   What other types of payments are required under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.558

          (a) The lessee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and assessments associated with the use of the land, as determined by entities having jurisdiction, except as provided in § 162.017. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office.

          (b) If the leased premises are within an Indian irrigation project or drainage district, except as otherwise provided in part 171 of this chapter, the lessee must pay all operation and maintenance charges that accrue during the lease term. The lessee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office in charge of the irrigation project or drainage district. We will treat failure to make these payments as a violation of the lease.

          (c) Where the property is subject to at least one other lease for another compatible use, such as grazing, the lessees may agree among themselves how to allocate payment of the operation and maintenance charges.

        WSR Lease Bonding and Insurance

          § 162.559   Must a lessee provide a performance bond for a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.559

          The lessee must provide a performance bond or alternative form of security, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

          (a) The performance bond or alternative form of security must be in an amount sufficient to secure the contractual obligations including:

          (1) No less than:

          (i) The highest annual rental specified in the lease, if the compensation is paid annually; or

          (ii) If the compensation is not paid annually, another amount established by BIA in consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land;

          (2) The installation of any required permanent improvements;

          (3) The operation and maintenance charges for any land located within an irrigation project; and

          (4) The restoration and reclamation of the leased premises, to their condition at the start of the lease term or some other specified condition.

          (b) The performance bond or other security:

          (1) Must be deposited with us and made payable only to us, and may not be modified without our approval, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

          (2) For tribal land, if the lease so provides, may be deposited with the tribe and made payable to the tribe, and may not be modified without the approval of the tribe.

          (c) The lease must specify the conditions under which we may adjust security or performance bond requirements to reflect changing conditions, including consultation with the tribal landowner for tribal land before adjustment.

          (d) We may require that the surety provide any supporting documents needed to show that the performance bond or alternative forms of security will be enforceable, and that the surety will be able to perform the guaranteed obligations.

          (e) The performance bond or other security instrument must require the surety to provide notice to us at least 60 days before canceling a performance bond or other security. This will allow us to notify the lessee of its obligation to provide a substitute performance bond or other security and require collection of the bond or security before the cancellation date. Failure to provide a substitute performance bond or security is a violation of the lease.

          (f) We may waive the requirement for a performance bond or alternative forms of security if:

          (1) The lease is for public purposes; or

          (2) The Indian landowners request it and we determine a waiver is in the Indian landowners' best interest.

          (g) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that a waiver of the performance bond or alternative form of security is in its best interest, to the maximum extent possible.

          § 162.560   What forms of security are acceptable under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.560

          (a) We will accept a performance bond only in one of the following forms:

          (1) Certificates of deposit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (2) Irrevocable letters of credit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (3) Negotiable Treasury securities; or

          (4) Surety bonds issued by a company approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

          (b) We may accept an alternative form of security approved by us that provides adequate protection for the Indian landowners and us, including but not limited to an escrow agreement and assigned savings account.

          (c) All forms of performance bonds or alternative security must, if applicable:

          (1) Indicate on their face that BIA approval is required for redemption;

          (2) Be accompanied by a statement granting full authority to BIA to make an immediate claim upon or sell them if the lessee violates the terms of the lease;

          (3) Be irrevocable during the term of the performance bond or alternative security; and

          (4) Be automatically renewable during the term of the lease.

          (d) We will not accept cash bonds.

          § 162.561   What is the release process for a performance bond or alternative form of security under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.561

          (a) Upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease, the lessee must ask BIA in writing to release the performance bond or alternative form of security.

          (b) Upon receiving the request under paragraph (a) of this section, BIA will:

          (1) Confirm with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, that the lessee has complied with all lease obligations; and

          (2) Release the performance bond or alternative form of security to the lessee unless we determine that the bond or security must be redeemed to fulfill the contractual obligations.

          § 162.562   Must a lessee provide insurance for a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.562

          Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lessee must provide insurance when necessary to protect the interests of Indian landowners and in the amount sufficient to protect all insurable permanent improvements on the leased premises.

          (a) The insurance may include property, liability, and casualty insurance, depending on the Indian landowners' interests to be protected.

          (b) Both the Indian landowners and the United States must be identified as additional insured parties.

          (c) We may waive the requirement for insurance upon the request of the Indian landowner, if a waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowner, including if the lease is for less than fair market rental or nominal compensation. For tribal land, we will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver is in its best interest.

        WSR Lease Approval

          § 162.563   What documents are required for BIA approval of a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.563

          A lessee or the Indian landowners must submit the following documents to us to obtain BIA approval of a WSR lease:

          (h) A resource development plan that describes the type and location of any permanent improvements the lessee plans to install and a schedule showing the tentative commencement and completion dates for those improvements;

          (i) A restoration and reclamation plan (and any subsequent modifications to the plan);

          (j) Where the lessee is not an entity owned and operated by the tribe, documents that demonstrate the technical capability of the lessee or lessee's agent to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the proposed project and the lessee's ability to successfully design, construct, or obtain the funding for a project similar to the proposed project, if appropriate;

          (2) The lease will be enforceable against the lessee; and

          (3) The legal entity is in good standing and authorized to conduct business in the jurisdiction where the land is located.

          § 162.564   Will BIA review a proposed WSR lease before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation?

#### § § 162.564

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we will review the proposed WSR lease after negotiation by the parties, before or during preparation of the NEPA review documentation and any valuation. Within 60 days of receiving the proposed lease, we will provide an acknowledgement of the terms of the lease and identify any provisions that, based on this acknowledgment review, would justify disapproval of the lease, pending results of the NEPA review and any valuation.

          § 162.565   What is the approval process for a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.565

          (a) Before we approve a WSR lease, we must determine that the lease is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the lease and supporting documents;

          (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances;

          (3) If the lease is being approved under 25 U.S.C. 415, assure ourselves that adequate consideration has been given to the factors in 25 U.S.C. 415(a); and

          (4) Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures necessary to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land use requirements.

          (b) Upon receiving a WSR lease package, we will promptly notify the parties whether the package is or is not complete. A complete package includes all the information and supporting documents required under this subpart, including but not limited to, NEPA review documentation and valuation documentation, where applicable.

          (1) If the WSR lease package is not complete, our letter will identify the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If we do not respond to the submission of a WSR lease package, the parties may take action under § 162.588.

          (2) If the WSR lease package is complete, we will notify the parties of the date of receipt. Within 60 days of the receipt date, we will approve or disapprove the lease, return the package for revision, or inform the parties in writing that we need additional review time. If we inform the parties in writing that we need additional time, then:

          (i) Our letter informing the parties that we need additional review time must identify our initial concerns and invite the parties to respond within 15 days of the date of the letter; and

          (ii) We have 30 days from sending the letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the lease.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadlines in this section, then the parties may take appropriate action under § 162.588.

          (d) We will provide any lease approval or disapproval and the basis for the determination, along with notification of any appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter, in writing to the parties to the lease.

          (e) We will provide approved WSR leases on tribal land to the lessee and provide a copy to the tribe. We will provide approved WSR leases on individually owned Indian land to the lessee, and make copies available to the Indian landowners upon written request.

          § 162.566   How will BIA decide whether to approve a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.566

          (a) We will approve a WSR lease unless:

          (1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the lease;

          (2) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the WSR lease is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a WSR lease.

          § 162.567   When will a WSR lease be effective?

#### § § 162.567

          (a) A WSR lease will be effective on the date that we approve the lease, even if an appeal is filed under part 2 of this chapter.

          (b) The lease may specify a date on which the obligations between the parties to the lease are triggered. Such date may be before or after the approval date under paragraph (a) of this section.

          § 162.568   Must a WSR lease document be recorded?

#### § § 162.568

          (b) If we determine there has been a violation of the conditions of a WSR lease, other than a violation of payment provisions covered by paragraph (c) of this section, we will promptly send the lessee and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested.

          (i) Cure the violation and notify us, and the tribe for tribal land, in writing that the violation has been cured;

          (ii) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred; or

          (1) We will send the lessees and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested:

          (i) Promptly following the date on which payment was due, if the lease requires that payments be made to us; or

          (ii) Promptly following the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the Indian landowners, if the lease provides for payment directly to the Indian landowners.

          (2) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

          (3) The notice of violation will require the lessee to provide adequate proof of payment.

          § 162.592   What will BIA do if a lessee does not cure a violation of a WSR lease on time?

#### § § 162.592

          (a) If the lessee does not cure a violation of a WSR lease within the required time period, or provide adequate proof of payment as required in the notice of violation, we will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether:

          (1) We should cancel the lease;

          (2) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the lease;

          (3) We should invoke other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including collection on any available performance bond or, for failure to pay compensation, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or

          (4) The lessee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

          (b) Following consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, we may take action to recover unpaid compensation and any associated late payment charges.

          (1) We do not have to cancel the lease or give any further notice to the lessee before taking action to recover unpaid compensation.

          (2) We may still take action to recover any unpaid compensation if we cancel the lease.

          (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the lessee and any surety and mortgagee a cancellation letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 5 business days of our decision. We will send a copy of the cancellation letter to the tribe for tribal land, and will provide Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land with actual or constructive notice of the cancellation. The cancellation letter will:

          (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

          (2) If applicable, notify the lessee of the amount of any unpaid compensation or late payment charges due under the lease;

          (3) Notify the lessee of the lessee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, including the possibility that the official to whom the appeal is made may require the lessee to post an appeal bond;

          (4) Order the lessee to vacate the property within 31 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time; and

          (5) Order the lessee to take any other action BIA deems necessary to protect the Indian landowners.

          (d) We may invoke any other remedies available to us under the lease, including collecting on any available performance bond, and the Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under tribal law.

          § 162.593   Will late payment charges or special fees apply to delinquent payments due under a WSR lease?

#### § § 162.593

          (a) Late payment charges will apply as specified in the lease. The failure to pay these amounts will be treated as a lease violation.

          (b) We may assess the following special fees to cover administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of the debt, if compensation is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to late payment charges that must be paid to the Indian landowners under the lease:

          § 162.594   How will payment rights relating to WSR leases be allocated?

#### § § 162.594

          The WSR lease may allocate rights to payment for insurance proceeds, trespass damages, compensation awards, settlement funds, and other payments between the Indian landowners and the lessee. If not specified in the lease, insurance policy, order, award, judgment, or other document, the Indian landowners will be entitled to receive these payments.

          § 162.595   When will a cancellation of a WSR lease be effective?

#### § § 162.595

          (a) A cancellation involving a WSR lease will not be effective until 31 days after the lessee receives a cancellation letter from us, or 41 days from the date we mailed the letter, whichever is earlier.

          (b) The cancellation decision will not be effective if an appeal is filed unless the cancellation is made immediately effective under part 2 of this chapter. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the lessee must continue to pay compensation and comply with the other terms of the lease.

          § 162.596   What will BIA do if a lessee remains in possession after a WSR lease expires or is terminated or cancelled?

#### § § 162.596

          If a lessee remains in possession after the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a WSR lease, we may treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass under applicable law in consultation with the Indian landowners. Unless the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests under § 162.012 have notified us in writing that they are engaged in good faith negotiations with the holdover lessee to obtain a new lease, we may take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, such as a forcible entry and detainer action.

          § 162.597   Will BIA appeal bond regulations apply to cancellation decisions involving WSR leases?

#### § § 162.597

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appeal bond provisions in part 2 of this chapter will apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions.

          (b) The lessee may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The lessee may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the appeal bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

          § 162.598   When will BIA issue a decision on an appeal from a WSR leasing decision?

#### § § 162.598

          BIA will issue a decision on an appeal from a WSR leasing decision within 60 days of receipt of all pleadings.

          § 162.599   What happens if the lessee abandons the leased premises?

#### § § 162.599

          If a lessee abandons the leased premises, we will treat the abandonment as a violation of the lease. The lease may specify a period of non-use after which the lease premises will be considered abandoned.

      Subpart F—Special Requirements for Certain Reservations

        § 162.600   Crow Reservation.

#### § § 162.600

        (a) Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part 162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80). However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a matter of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general regulations contained in this part 162 shall be applicable. Approval of the Secretary is required on leases signed by Crow Indians not classified as competent or made on inherited or devised trust lands owned by more than five competent devisees or heirs.

        (b) The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years, except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years authorized by law.

        (c) All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent, under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed. Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved. Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such instrument will be returned without recordation.

        (d) Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon discovery of the condition:

        (1) The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by all owners of the land described in the lease;

        (2) There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of the same term;

        (3) The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land utilization plans and conservation practices; or

        (4) There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to, erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly endorsed by the lessor.

        (e) Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust lands.

        (f) Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute as to the amount of such damage, the matter will be referred to the Secretary whose determination will be final as to the amount of said damage.

        § 162.602   Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Reservations, California.

#### § § 162.602

        (a) Upon a determination by the Secretary that the owner or owners are not making beneficial use thereof, restricted lands on the Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations which are or may be irrigated from distribution facilities administered by the Coachella Valley County Water District in Riverside County, California, may be leased by the Secretary in accordance with the regulations in this part for the benefit of the owner or owners.

        (b) All leases granted or approved on restricted lands of the Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations shall be filed for record in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the land is located, the cost thereof to be paid by the lessee. A copy of each such lease shall be filed by the lessee with the Coachella Valley County Water District or such other irrigation or water district within which the leased lands are located. All such leases shall include a provision that the lessee, in addition to the rentals provided for in the lease, shall pay all irrigation charges properly assessed against the land which became payable during the term of the lease. Act of August 25, 1950 (64 Stat. 470); Act of August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 968).

#### § § 162.603

        (a)  The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Arizona, in addition to that contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25 U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in part 162 apply. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 Act does not apply to leases made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining leases on Indian lands.

        (b)  Leases made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing lease shall not exceed ten years; the term of a farming lease that does not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed ten years; and the term of a farming lease that requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option to renew which extends the total term beyond the maximum term permitted by this section.

        (c)  Every lease under the 1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property wherever such persons or property may be.

        (d)  If the Secretary determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of such terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to the authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be submitted.

        (e)  The regulations in part 162 of this title shall apply to leases made under the 1966 Act except where such regulations are inconsistent with this section.

        (f)  Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.

        (b) Indian forest land management activities undertaken by the Secretary shall be designed to achieve the following objectives:

        (1) The development, maintenance and enhancement of Indian forest land in a perpetually productive state in accordance with the principles of sustained yield and with the standards and objectives set forth in forest management plans by providing effective management and protection through the application of sound silvicultural and economic principles to the harvesting of forest products, forestation, timber stand improvement and other forestry practices;

        (2) The regulation of Indian forest land through the development and implementation, with the full and active consultation and participation of the appropriate Indian tribe, of forest management plans which are supported by written tribal objectives;

        (3) The regulation of Indian forest land in a manner that will ensure the use of good method and order in harvesting so as to make possible, on a sustained yield basis, continuous productivity and a perpetual forest business;

        (4) The development of Indian forest land and associated value-added industries by Indians and Indian tribes to promote self-sustaining communities, so that Indians may receive from their Indian forest land not only stumpage value, but also the benefit of all the labor and profit that such Indian forest land is capable of yielding;

        (5) The retention of Indian forest land in its natural state when an Indian tribe determines that the recreational, cultural, aesthetic, or traditional values of the Indian forest land represents the highest and best use of the land;

        (6) The management and protection of forest resources to retain the beneficial effects to Indian forest land of regulating water run-off and minimizing soil erosion; and

        (7) The maintenance and improvement of timber productivity, grazing, wildlife, fisheries, recreation, aesthetic, cultural and other traditional values.

        § 163.4   Secretarial recognition of tribal laws.

#### § § 163.4

Open market sales of forest products from Indian land located off reservations will be permitted with the consent of the Secretary and majority Indian interest of the beneficial Indian owner(s).

        (b) On individually owned Indian forest land not formally designated for retention in its natural state, the Secretary may, after consultation, sell the forest products without the consent of the owner(s) when in his or her judgment such action is necessary to prevent loss of value resulting from fire, insects, diseases, windthrow or other catastrophes.

        (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each sale of forest products having an estimated stumpage value exceeding $15,000 will not be approved until:

        (1) An examination of the forest products to be sold has been made by a forest officer; and

        (2) A report setting forth all pertinent information has been submitted to the approving officer as provided in § 163.20 of this part.

        (d) With the approval of the Secretary, authorized beneficial Indian owners who have been duly apprised as to the value of the forest products to be sold, may sell or transfer forest products for less than the appraised value.

        (e) Except as provided in § 163.14(d) of this part, in all such sales, the forest products shall be appraised and sold at stumpage rates not less than those established by the Secretary.

Advertised sales shall be made under sealed bids, or at public auction, or under a combination thereof. The advertisement may limit sales of Indian forest products to Indian forest enterprises, members of the tribe, or may grant to Indian forest enterprises and/or members of the tribe who submitted bids the right to meet the higher bid of a non-member. If the estimated stumpage value of the forest products offered does not exceed $15,000, the advertisement may be made by posters and circular letters. If the estimated stumpage value exceeds $15,000, the advertisement shall also be made in at least one edition of a newspaper of general circulation in the locality where the forest products are situated. If the estimated stumpage value does not exceed $50,000, the advertisement shall be made for not less than 15 days; if the estimated stumpage value exceeds $50,000 but not $250,000, for not less than 30 days; and if the estimated stumpage value exceeds $250,000, for not less than 60 days.

        (b) The approving officer may reduce the advertising period because of emergencies such as fire, insect attack, blowdown, limitation of time, or when there would be no practical advantage in advertising for the prescribed period.

        (c) If no instrument of sale is executed after such advertisement, the approving officer may, within one year from the last day on which bids were to be received as defined in the advertisement, permit the sale of such forest products.

Contracts must be approved by the Secretary to be valid.

        (b) Contracts for the sale of individually owned forest products shall be executed by the beneficial Indian owner(s) or the Secretary acting pursuant to a power of attorney from the beneficial Indian owner(s). Contracts must be approved by the Secretary to be valid.

        (1) The Secretary may, after consultation with any legally appointed guardian, execute contracts on behalf of minors and beneficial Indian owners who are non compos mentis.

        (2) The Secretary may execute contracts for a decedent's estate where ownership has not been determined or for those persons who cannot be located after a reasonable and diligent search and the giving of notice by publication.

        (3) Upon the request of the owner of an undivided but unrestricted interest in land in which there are trust or restricted Indian interests, the Secretary may include such unrestricted interest in a sale of the trust or restricted interests in the timber, pursuant to this part, and perform any functions required of him/her by the contract of sale for both the restricted and the unrestricted interests, including the collection and disbursement of payments for timber and the forest management deductions from such payments.

        (4) When consent of only a majority interest has been obtained, the Secretary may execute the sale on behalf of all owners to fulfill responsibilities to the beneficiaries of the trust. In such event, the contract file must contain evidence of the effort to obtain consent of all owners. When an individual cannot be located, the Secretary, after a reasonable and diligent search and the giving of notice by publication, may sign a power of attorney consenting to the sale for particular interests. For Indian forest land containing undivided restricted and unrestricted interests, only the restricted interests are considered in determining if a majority interest has been obtained.

        (a) The basis of volume determination for forest products sold shall be the Scribner Decimal C log rules, cubic volume, lineal measurement, piece count, weight, or such other form of measurement as the Secretary may authorize for use. With the exception of Indian tribal forest enterprises pursuant to § 163.13 of this part, payment for forest products will be required in advance of cutting for timber, or removal for other forest products.

        (b) Upon the request of an Indian tribe, the Secretary may provide that the purchaser of the forest products of such tribe, which are harvested under a timber sale contract, permit, or other harvest sale document to make advanced deposits, or direct payments of the gross proceeds of such forest products, less any amounts segregated as forest management deductions pursuant to § 163.25 of this part, into accounts designated by such Indian tribe. Such accounts may be in one or more of the following formats:

        (1) Escrow accounts at a tribally designated financial institution for receiving deposits with bids and advance deposits from which direct disbursements for timber harvested shall be made to tribes and forest management deductions accounts; or

        (2) Tribal depository accounts for receiving advance payments, installment payments, payments from Indian tribal forest enterprises, and/or disbursements from advance deposit accounts or escrow accounts.

        (c) The format must allow the Secretary to maintain trust responsibility through written verification that all required deposits, payments, and disbursements have been made.

        (d) Terms and conditions for payment of forest products under lump sum (predetermined volume) sales shall be specified in forest product contract documents.

        § 163.23   Advance payment for timber products.

#### § § 163.23

        (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, and except in the case of lump sum (predetermined volume) sales, contracts for the sale of timber from allotted, trust or restricted Indian forest land shall provide for an advance payment of up to 25 percent of the stumpage value, calculated at the bid price, within 30 days from the date of approval and before cutting begins. Additional advance payments may be specified in contracts. However, no advance payment will be required that would make the sum of such payment and of advance deposits and advance payments previously applied against timber cut from each ownership in a sale exceed 50 percent of the bid stumpage value. Advance payments shall be credited against the timber of each ownership in the sale as the timber is cut and scaled at stumpage rates governing at the time of scaling. Advance payments are not refundable.

        (b) Advance payments may be required on tribal land. When required, advance payments will operate the same as provided for in § 163.23(a) of this part.

        § 163.25   Forest management deductions.

#### § § 163.25

        (a) Pursuant to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 413 and 25 U.S.C. 3105, a forest management deduction shall be withheld from the gross proceeds of sales of forest products harvested from Indian forest land as described in this section.

        (b) Gross proceeds shall mean the value in money or money's worth of consideration furnished by the purchaser of forest products purchased under a contract, permit, or other document for the sale of forest products.

        (c) Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where the total consideration furnished under a contract, permit or other document for the sale of forest products is less than $5,001.

        (d) Except as provided in § 163.25(e) of this part, the amount of the forest management deduction shall not exceed the lesser amount of ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds or, the actual percentage in effect on November 28, 1990.

        (e) The Secretary may increase the forest management deduction percentage for Indian forest land upon receipt of a written request from a tribe supported by a resolution executed by the authorized tribal representatives. At the request of the authorized tribal representatives and at the discretion of the Secretary the forest management deduction percentage may be decreased to not less than one percent (1%) or the requirement for collection may be waived.

        (f) Forest management deductions are to be utilized to perform forest land management activities in accordance with an approved expenditure plan. Expenditure plans shall describe the forest land management activities anticipated to be undertaken, establish a time period for their completion, summarize anticipated obligations and expenditures, and specify the method through which funds are to be transferred or credited to tribal accounts from special deposit accounts established to hold amounts withheld as forest management deductions. Any forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved expenditure plan by the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the deductions are withheld, shall be collected into the general funds of the United States Treasury pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 413.

        (1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a written expenditure plan for the use of forest management deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary. The approval of the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes allocation of tribal funds for Indian forest land management activities. Approval of the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall constitute authority for crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected by the Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to the approved expenditure plan for the performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from which the forest management deduction is collected.

        (2) Forest management deductions shall be handled in the same manner as described under § 163.25(f)(1) of this part if the expenditure plan approved by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides for the conduct of forest land management activities on Indian forest lands located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation.

        (3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for Indians by the United States, forest management deductions may be utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in accordance with an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary.

        (g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section shall not be available to cover the costs that are paid from funds appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset federal appropriations for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for management of Indian forest land.

        (h) Within 120 days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, tribes shall submit to the Secretary a written report detailing the actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past fiscal year. The Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, books, or other tribal records supporting the report.

        (i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available until expended.

        (j) As provided in § 163.25(f) of this part, only forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved expenditure plan may be deposited to a U.S. Treasury miscellaneous receipt account. No amount collected as forest management deductions shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest management deductions or fees derived from Indian forest land shall be collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States Treasury.

        § 163.26   Forest product harvesting permits.

#### § § 163.26

Permits will be issued only with the written consent of the beneficial Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest of forest products from Indian forest land, as authorized in § 163.20 of this part. To be valid, permits must be approved by the Secretary. Minimum stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold will be set at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment and bonding requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as appropriate.

        (b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated that forest products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for other goods or services. The estimated value which may be harvested in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $5,000. For the purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.

        (c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as provided in § 163.25 of this part, may be issued. Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $25,000. For the purpose of issuance of paid permits, individual shall mean an individual or any operating entity comprised of more than one individual.

        (d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment to harvest and sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special permit shall include provision for payment by the Indian of forest management deductions pursuant to § 163.25 of this part. Unless waived by the Secretary, the permit shall also require the Indian to make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by § 163.21. Such bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the permit or will be used by the Secretary in his or her discretion for planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused by failure to comply with the provisions of the permit. As a condition to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the Indian shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary that he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the forest products, on terms that will protect the Indian's interests.

        § 163.27   Free-use harvesting without permits.

#### § § 163.27

        With the consent of the beneficial Indian owners and the Secretary, Indians may harvest designated types of forest products from Indian forest land without a permit or contract, and without charge. Forest products harvested under this authority shall be for the Indian's personal use, and shall not be sold or exchanged for other goods or services.

        § 163.28   Fire management measures.

#### § § 163.28

        (a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment, purchase tools and supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an adequate level of readiness to meet normal wildfire protection needs and extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for fighting a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred pursuant to an approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates of pay for fire fighters and for equipment rental shall be the rates for fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a fire occurs, unless there are in effect at the time different rates that have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into reciprocal agreements with any fire organization maintaining protection facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian land for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements for mutual aid in fire protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).

        (b) The Secretary is authorized to conduct a wildfire prevention program to reduce the number of person-caused fires and prevent damage to natural resources on Indian land.

        (c) The Secretary is authorized to expend funds for emergency rehabilitation measures needed to stabilize soil and watershed on Indian land damaged by wildfire.

        (d) Upon consultation with the beneficial Indian owners, the Secretary may use fire as a management tool on Indian land to achieve land and/or resource management objectives.

        § 163.29   Trespass.

#### § § 163.29

        (a) Trespassers will be liable for civil penalties and damages to the enforcement agency and the beneficial Indian owners, and will be subject to prosecution for acts of trespass.

        (1)  For trespass actions brought in tribal court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this § 163.29 of this part. All other aspects of a tribal trespass prosecution brought under these regulations will be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, unless otherwise prescribed under federal law. Absent applicable tribal or federal law, the measure of damages shall be that prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed.

        (2)  For trespass actions brought in Federal court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this § 163.29. In the absence of applicable federal law, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law, the law of the state in which it was committed.

        (3) Civil penalties for trespass include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority injures, severs, or carries off from a reservation any forest product as defined in § 163.1 of this part. Proof of Indian ownership of the premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser are prima facie evidence sufficient to support liability for treble damages, with no requirement to show willfulness or intent. Treble damages shall be based upon the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass.

        (ii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land includes, but is not limited to, rehabilitation, reforestation, lost future revenue and lost profits, loss of productivity, and damage to other forest resources.

        (iii) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with detection and including all processes through the prosecution and collection of damages, including but not limited to field examination and survey, damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness expenses, demand letters, court costs, and attorney fees.

        (iv) Interest calculated at the statutory rate prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law in the amount prescribed by federal law. Where tribal law or federal law does not supply a statutory interest rate, the rate of interest shall be statutory rate upon judgments as prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed. Interest shall be based on treble the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass, and calculated from the date of the trespass until payment is rendered.

        (b) Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment or other goods or from forest products damaged or taken in the trespass shall be applied to satisfy civil penalties and other damages identified under § 163.29(a) of this part. After disposition of real and personal property to pay civil penalties and damages resulting from trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the event that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the trespasser result in less than full recovery, civil penalties shall be distributed as follows:

        (1) Collection of damages up to the highest stumpage value of the trespass products shall be distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners and any costs and expenses needed to restore the trespass land; or

        (2) Collections exceeding the highest stumpage value of the trespass product, but less than full recovery, shall be proportionally distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners, the law enforcement agency, and the cost to restore the trespass land. Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where less than the highest stumpage value of the unprocessed forest products taken in trespass has been recovered.

        (c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or who are involved in trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which such owners have a partial interest, shall not receive their beneficial share of any civil penalties and damages collected in consequence of the trespass. Any civil penalties and damages defaulted in consequence of this provision instead shall be distributed first toward restoration of the land subject of the trespass and second toward costs of the enforcement agency in consequence of the trespass, with any remainder to the forest management deduction account of the reservation in which the trespass took place.

        (d) Civil penalties and other damages collected under these regulations, except for penalties and damages provided for in §§ 163.29(a)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this part, shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of forest products from the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred.

        (e) When a federal official or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part has reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass, such individual may seize and take possession of the forest products involved in the trespass if the products are located on reservation. When forest products are seized, the person seizing the products must at the time of the seizure issue a Notice of Seizure to the possessor or claimant of the forest products. The Notice of Seizure shall indicate the date of the seizure, a description of the forest products seized, the estimated value of forest products seized, an indication of whether the forest products are perishable, and the name and authority of the person seizing the forest products. Where the official initiates seizure under these regulations only, the Notice of Seizure shall further include the statement that any challenge or objection to the seizure shall be exclusively through administrative appeal pursuant to part 2 of title 25, and shall provide the name and the address of the official with whom the appeal may be filed. Alternately, an official may exercise concurrent tribal seizure authority under these regulations using applicable tribal law. In such case, the Notice of Seizure shall identify the tribal law under which the seizure may be challenged, if any. A copy of a Notice of Seizure shall be given to the possessor or claimant at the time of the seizure. If the claimant or possessor is unknown or unavailable, Notice of Seizure shall be posted on the trespass property, and a copy of the Notice shall be kept with any incident report generated by the official seizing the forest products. If the property seized is perishable and will lose substantial value if not sold or otherwise disposed of, the representative of the Secretary, or authorized tribal representative where deferral has been requested, may cause the forest products to be sold. Such sale action shall not be stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal nor by a challenge of the seizure action through a tribal forum. All proceeds from the sale of the forest products shall be placed into an escrow account and held until adjudication or other resolution of the underlying trespass. If it is found that the forest products seized were involved in a trespass, the proceeds shall be applied to the amount of civil penalties and damages awarded. If it is found that a trespass has not occurred or the proceeds are in excess of the amount of the judgment awarded, the proceeds or excess proceeds shall be returned to the possessor or claimant.

        (f) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass and that such products have been removed to land not under federal or tribal government supervision, the federal official or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(k) of this part responsible for the trespass shall immediately provide the following notice to the owner of the land or the party in possession of the trespass products:

        (1) That such products could be Indian trust property involved in a trespass; and

        (2) That removal or disposition of the forest products may result in criminal and/or civil action by the United States or tribe.

        (g) A representative of the Secretary or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part will promptly determine if a trespass has occurred. The appropriate representative will issue an official Notice of Trespass to the alleged trespasser and, if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. The Notice is intended to inform the trespasser, buyer, or the processor:

        (1) That a determination has been made that a trespass has occurred;

        (2) The basis for the determination;

        (3) An assessment of the damages, penalties and costs;

        (4) Of the seizure of forest products, if applicable; and

        (5) That disposition or removal of Indian forest products taken in the trespass may result in civil and/or criminal action by the United States or the tribe.

        (h) The Secretary may accept payment of damages in the settlement of civil trespass cases. In the absence of a court order, the Secretary will determine the procedure and approve acceptance of any settlements negotiated by a tribe exercising its concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part.

        (i) The Secretary may delegate by written agreement or contract, responsibility for detection and investigation of forest trespass.

        (j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall have concurrent civil jurisdiction to enforce 25 U.S.C. 3106 and this section against any person.

        (1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass, upon:

        (i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's adoption of this section; and

        (ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including a statement that the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act or a tribal civil rights law that contains provisions for due process and equal protection that are similar to or stronger than those contained in the Indian Civil Rights Act.

        (2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass cases as set forth in § 163.29(j)(1) of this part, the Secretary and tribe's authorized representatives will be jointly responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions. The Secretary shall, upon timely request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest trespasses to the tribe. Where said deferral is not requested, the designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall coordinate with the authorized forest trespass official of each tribe the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction as to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in which forums to recommend bringing an action, and promptly provide their recommendation to the Federal officials responsible for initiating and prosecuting forest trespass cases. Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction, but does not request deferral of prosecution, the federal officials responsible for initiating and prosecuting such cases may file and prosecute the action in the tribal court or forum.

        (3) The Secretary may rescind an Indian tribe's concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass cases under this regulation if the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the tribal court has not adhered to the due process or equal protection requirements of the Indian Civil Rights Act. If it is determined that said rescission is justified, the Secretary shall provide written Notice of the rescission, including the findings justifying the rescission and the steps needed to remedy the violations causing the rescission, to the chief judge of the tribal judiciary or other authorized tribal official should there be no chief judge. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary's rescission of concurrent civil jurisdiction shall become final. The affected tribe(s) may appeal a Notice of Rescission under part 2 of title 25.

        (4) Nothing shall be construed to prohibit or in any way diminish the authority of a tribe to prosecute individuals under its criminal or civil trespass laws where it has jurisdiction over those individuals.

        § 163.30   Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products.

#### § § 163.30

        (a) In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 415 as amended, the Secretary may request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits designating the Secretary as agent for the landowner and empowering him or her to issue revocable road use and construction permits to users for the purpose of removing forest products.

        (b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and con- struction permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual owners when:

        (1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis, and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;

        (2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or those with an interest therein are unknown so long as the majority of owner(s) of interests whose whereabouts are known, consent to the grant;

        (3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest have not been determined, and the Secretary finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any land owner; or

        (4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner(s), that cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages.

        (c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-way over Indian lands, under 25 CFR part 169, or conflict with provisions of that part.

        § 163.31   Insect and disease control.

#### § § 163.31

        (a) The Secretary is authorized to protect and preserve Indian forest land from disease or insects (Sept. 20, 1922, Ch. 349, 42 Stat. 857). The Secretary shall consult with the authorized tribal representatives and beneficial owners of Indian forest land concerning control actions.

        (b) The Secretary is responsible for controlling and mitigating harmful effects of insects and diseases on Indian forest land and will coordinate control actions with the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with 92 Stat. 365, 16 U.S.C. 2101.

        § 163.32   Forest development.

#### § § 163.32

        Forest development pertains to forest land management activities undertaken to improve the sustainable productivity of commercial Indian forest land. The program shall consist of reforestation, timber stand improvement projects, and related investments to enhance productivity of commercial forest land with emphasis on accomplishing on-the-ground projects. Forest development funds will be used to re-establish, maintain, and/or improve growth of commercial timber species and control stocking levels on commercial forest land. Forest development activities will be planned and executed using benefit-cost analyses as one of the determinants in establishing priorities for project funding.

        § 163.33   Administrative appeals.

#### § § 163.33

        Any challenge to action under 25 CFR part 163 taken by an approving officer or subordinate official exercising delegated authority from the Secretary shall be exclusively through administrative appeal or as provided in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, as amended). Such appeal(s) shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of 25 CFR part 2, Appeals from administrative actions, except that an appeal of any action under part 163 of this title shall:

        (f) Determination of qualification for level of funding assistance shall be as follows:

        (1) A funding level qualification value shall be determined for each eligible applicant using the formula below. Such formula shall only be used to determine which applicants qualify for level one funding assistance. Acreage and allowable cut data used in the formula shall be as maintained by the Secretary. Eligible applicants with a funding level qualification value of one (1) or greater shall qualify for level one assistance.

        (2) All category 1 or 2 reservations that are eligible applicants under § 163.36(d) of this part are qualified and eligible for level two assistance.

        (3) All category 1, 2 or 3 reservations that are eligible applicants under § 163.36(d) of this part are qualified and eligible for level three assistance.

        (g) Tribal forestry program financial support funds shall be distributed based on the following:

        (1) All requests from reservations qualifying for level one funding assistance must be satisfied before funds are made available for level two funding assistance;

        (2) All requests from reservations qualifying for level two funding assistance must be satisfied before funds are made available for level three funding assistance; and

        (3) If available funding is not adequate to satisfy all requests at a particular level of funding, funds will be evenly divided among tribes qualifying at that level.

      Subpart A—Purpose, Scope, and Definitions

        § 166.1   What is the purpose and scope of this part?

#### § § 166.1

        (a) The purpose of this part is to describe the authorities, policies, and procedures the BIA uses to approve, grant, and administer a permit for grazing on tribal land, individually-owned Indian land, or government land.

        (b) If the BIA's approval is not required for a permit, these regulations will not apply.

        (c) These regulations do not apply to any tribal land which is permitted under a corporate charter issued by us pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 477, or under a special act of Congress authorizing permits without our approval under certain conditions, except to the extent that the authorizing statutes require us to enforce such permits on behalf of the Indian landowners.

        (d) To the extent that any provisions of this part conflict with Section 213 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, the provisions of that act will govern.

        (e) In approving a permit on behalf of the Indian landowners, the BIA will not permit for fee interest owners nor will we collect rent on behalf of fee interest owners. Our permitting of the trust and restricted interests of the Indian landowners will not be conditioned on a permit having been obtained from any fee interest owners. However, where all of the trust or restricted interests in a tract are subject to a life estate held in fee status, we will approve a permit of the remainder interests of the Indian landowners only if such action is necessary to preserve the value of the land or protect the interests of the Indian landowners. Where a life estate and remainder interest are both owned in trust or restricted status, the life estate and remainder interest must both be permitted under these regulations, unless the permit is for less than one year in duration. Unless otherwise provided by the document creating the life estate or by agreement, rent payable under the permit must be paid to the holder of the life estate under part 179 of this title.

        § 166.2   Can the BIA waive the application of these regulations?

#### § § 166.2

        Yes. In any case in which these regulations conflict with the objectives of the agricultural resource management plan provided for in § 166.311 of this part, or with a tribal law, the BIA may waive the application of such regulations unless the waiver would constitute a violation of a federal statute or judicial decision or would conflict with the BIA's general trust responsibility under federal law.

        § 166.3   May decisions under this part be appealed?

#### § § 166.3

        Yes. Except where otherwise provided in this part, appeals from decisions by the BIA under this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.

#### § § 166.100

        (a) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for permitting of Indian agricultural lands, the BIA will:

        (1) Waive the general prohibition against Indian operator preferences in permits advertised for bid under § 166.221 of this part, by allowing prospective Indian operators to match the highest responsible bid (unless the tribal law or leasing policy specifies some other manner in which the preference must be afforded);

        (2) Waive or modify the requirement that a permittee post a surety or performance bond;

        (3) Provide for posting of other collateral or security in lieu of surety or other bonds; and

        (4) Approve permits of tribally-owned agricultural lands at rates determined by the tribal governing body.

        (b) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for permitting of Indian agricultural lands, and subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the BIA may:

        (1) Waive or modify any general notice requirement of federal law; and

        (2) Grant or approve a permit on “highly fractionated undivided heirship lands” as defined by tribal law.

        (c) The BIA may take the action specified in paragraph (b) of this section only if:

        (1) The tribe defines by resolution what constitutes “highly fractionated undivided heirship lands”;

        (2) The tribe adopts an alternative plan for notifying individual Indian landowners; and

        (3) The BIA's action is necessary to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage and ensure income.

        § 166.101   May individual Indian landowners exempt their land from certain tribal policies for permitting on Indian agricultural lands?

#### § § 166.101

        (a) The individual Indian landowners of Indian land may exempt their land from our application of a tribal policy referred to under § 166.100 of this part if:

        (1) The Indian landowners have at least a 50% interest in such fractionated tract; and

        (2) The Indian landowners submit a written objection to the BIA of all or any part of such tribal policies to the permitting of such parcel of land.

        (b) Upon verification of the written objection we will notify the tribe of the Indian landowners' exemption from the specific tribal policy.

        (c) The procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will also apply to withdrawing an approved exemption.

        § 166.102   Do tribal laws apply to permits?

        (1) Assist in the enforcement of tribal laws;

        (2) Provide notice of tribal laws to persons or entities undertaking activities on Indian agricultural land, under § 166.104(b) of this part; and

        (3) Require appropriate federal officials to appear in tribal forums when requested by the tribe, so long as such an appearance would not:

        (i) Be inconsistent with the restrictions on employee testimony set forth at 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart E;

        (ii) Constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States; or

        (iii) Authorize or result in a review of our actions by a tribal court.

        (c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a tribal law, but such regulations cannot be superseded or modified by the tribal law under § 166.2 of this part, we may waive the regulations under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law.

In order to permit tribal land in which the beneficial interest has been assigned to another party, the assignee and the tribe must both grant the permit, subject to our approval.

          (b) Individual Indian landowners may grant a permit of their land, including their undivided interest in a fractionated tract, subject to our approval. Except as otherwise provided in this part, these Indian landowners may include the owner of a life estate holding 100 percent (%) interest in their land.

          (c) The owners of a majority interest in the Indian ownership of a fractionated tract may grant a permit, subject to our approval, without giving prior notice to the minority Indian landowners as long as the minority interest owners receive fair annual rental.

#### § § 166.206

          We may grant a permit on behalf of all Indian landowners of a fractionated tract as long as the owners receive fair annual rental. Before granting such a permit, we may offer a preference right to any Indian landowner who:

          (a) Is in possession of the entire tract;

          (c) Permits granted for agricultural purposes will not usually exceed ten years. A term longer than ten years, but not to exceed 25 years unless authorized by other federal law, may be authorized when a longer term is determined by us to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners and when such permit requires substantial investment in the development of the lands by the permittee.

          (d) A tribe may determine the duration of permits composed entirely of its tribal land or in combination with government land, subject to the same limitations provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

          § 166.217   In what manner may a permit on Indian land be granted?

#### § § 166.217

          (a) A tribe may grant a permit on tribal land through tribal allocation, negotiation, or advertisement in accordance with § 166.203 of this part. We must approve all permits of tribal land in order for the permit to be valid, except where otherwise provided by law.

          (b) Individual Indian landowners may grant a permit on their Indian land through negotiation or advertisement in accordance with § 166.203 of this part. We must approve all permits of Individual Indian land in order for the permit to be valid.

          (c) We will grant permits through negotiation or advertisement for range units containing, in whole or part, individually-owned Indian land and range units that consist of, or in combination with individually-owned Indian land, tribal or government land, under § 166.205 of this part. We will consult with tribes prior to granting permits for range units that include tribal land.

          (f) We will prescribe the eligibility requirements after the expiration of the 60-day period in the event satisfactory action is not taken by the tribe.

          (g) Grazing rental rates for grazing privileges allocated from an existing permit, in whole or in part, must equal or exceed the rates paid by the preceding permittee(s). Tribal members will pay grazing rental rates established by the tribe on tribal lands.

#### § § 166.219

          (a) Permits may be negotiated and granted by the Indian landowners with the permittee of their choice. The BIA may negotiate and grant permits on behalf of Indian landowners pursuant to § 166.205 of this part.

          (b) Upon the conclusion of negotiations with the Indian landowners or their representatives, and the satisfaction of any applicable conditions, you may submit an executed permit and any required supporting documents to us for appropriate action. Where a permit is in a form that has previously been accepted or approved by us, and all of the documents needed to support the findings required by this part have been received, we will decide whether to approve the permit within 30 days of the date of our receipt of the permit and supporting documents. If we decide to approve or disapprove a permit, we will notify the parties immediately and advise them of their right to appeal the decision under part 2 of this title.

          (c) In negotiating a permit, the Indian landowners may choose to include their land in the permit in exchange for their receipt of a share of the revenues or profits generated by the permit. Under such an arrangement, the permit may be granted to a joint venture or other legal entity owned, in part, by the Indian landowners.

          (d) Receipt of permit payments based upon income received from the land will not, of itself, make the Indian landowner a partner, joint venturer, or associate of the permittees.

          (e) We will assist prospective permittees in contacting the Indian landowners or their representatives, for the purpose of negotiating a permit.

          § 166.220   What are the basic steps for acquiring a permit through negotiation?

#### § § 166.220

          The basic steps for acquiring a permit by negotiation are as follows:

          (b) When the BIA grants and approves a permit on behalf of an individual Indian landowner using an advertisement for bids, we will:

          (1) Prepare and distribute an advertisement of lands available for permit that identifies the terms and conditions of the permit sale, including, for agricultural permits, any preference rights;

          (2) Solicit sealed bids and conduct the public permit sale;

          (3) Determine and accept the highest or best responsible bidder(s), which may require further competitive bidding after the bid opening; and

          (4) Prepare permits for successful bidders.

          (c) After completion of the steps in paragraph (b) of this section, the successful bidder must complete and submit the permit and satisfy all applicable requirements, (e.g., bond, insurance, payment of administrative fee, etc.).

        Permit (Leasehold) Mortgage

          § 166.223   Can I use a permit as collateral for a loan?

#### § § 166.223

          We may approve a permit containing a provision that authorizes the permittee to encumber the permit interest, known as a leasehold mortgage, for the development and improvement of the permitted Indian land. We must approve the leasehold mortgage that encumbers the permit interest before it can be effective. We will record the approved leasehold mortgage instrument.

          § 166.224   What factors does the BIA consider when reviewing a leasehold mortgage?

#### § § 166.224

          (a) We will approve the leasehold mortgage if:

          (1) All consents required in the permit have been obtained from the Indian landowners and any surety or guarantor;

          (2) The mortgage covers only the permit interest, and no unrelated collateral belonging to the permittee;

          (3) The financing being obtained will be used only in connection with the development or use of the permitted premises, and the mortgage does not secure any unrelated obligations owed by the permittee to the mortgagee; and

          (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval, in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowner.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, we will consider whether:

          (1) The ability to perform the permit obligations would be adversely affected by the cumulative mortgage obligations;

          (2) Any negotiated permit provisions as to the allocation or control of insurance or condemnation proceeds would be modified;

          (3) The remedies available to us or the Indian landowners would be limited (beyond the additional notice and cure rights to be afforded to the mortgagee), if the permittee defaults on the permit;

          (4) Any rights of the Indian landowners would be subordinated or adversely affected in the event of a foreclosure, assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or issuance of a “new permit” to the mortgagee.

          (c) We will notify the Indian landowners of our approval of the leasehold mortgage.

          § 166.225   May a permittee voluntarily assign a leasehold interest under an approved encumbrance?

#### § § 166.225

          With our approval, under an approved encumbrance, a permittee voluntarily may assign the leasehold interest to someone other than the holder of a leasehold mortgage if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the permit. A permit may provide the Indian landowners with a right of first refusal on the conveyance of the leasehold interest.

          § 166.226   May the holder of a leasehold mortgage assign the leasehold interest after a sale or foreclosure of an approved encumbrance?

#### § § 166.226

          Yes. The holder of a leasehold mortgage may assign a leasehold interest obtained by a sale or foreclosure of an approved encumbrance without our approval if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the permit. A permit may provide the Indian landowners with a right of first refusal on the conveyance of the permit interest (leasehold).

        Modifying a Permit

          § 166.227   How can Indian land be removed from an existing permit?

#### § § 166.227

          (a) We will remove Indian land from the permit if:

          (1) The trust status of the Indian land terminates;

          (2) The Indian landowners request removal of their interest, with the written approval of the majority interest of the fractionated tract to be removed, and we determine that the removal is beneficial to such interests;

          (3) A tribe allocates grazing privileges for Indian land covered by your permit under § 166.218 of this part;

          (4) The permittee requests removal of the Indian land, the owners of the majority interest of the Indian land provides written approval of the removal of the Indian land, and we determine that the removal is warranted; or

          (5) We determine that removal of the Indian land is appropriate, with the written approval of the owners of the majority interest of the Indian land.

          (b) We will revise the grazing capacity to reflect the removal of Indian land and show it on the permit.

          § 166.228   How will the BIA provide notice if Indian land is removed from an existing permit?

#### § § 166.228

          If the reason for removal is:

          (a) Termination of trust status. We will notify the parties to the permit in writing within 30 days. The removal will be effective on the next anniversary date of the permit.

          (b) A request from Indian landowners or the permittee, or our determination. We will notify the parties to the permit in writing within 30 days of such request. The removal will be effective immediately if all sureties, Indian landowners, and permittee agree. Otherwise, the removal will be effective upon the next anniversary date of the permit. If our written notice is within 180 days of the anniversary date of the permit, the removal of Indian land will be effective 180 days after the written notice.

          (c) Tribal allocation under § 166.218 of this part. We will notify the parties to the permit in writing within 180 days of such action. The removal of tribal land will be effective on the next anniversary date of the permit. If our written notice is within 180 days of the anniversary date of the permit, the removal of Indian land will be effective 180 days after the written notice.

          § 166.229   Other than to remove land, how can a permit be amended, assigned, subpermitted, or mortgaged?

#### § § 166.229

          (a) We must approve an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage with the written consent of the parties to the permit in the same manner that the permit was approved, and the consent of the sureties.

          (b) Indian landowners may designate in writing one or more of their co-owners or representatives to negotiate and/or agree to amendments on their behalf.

          (1) The designated landowner or representative may:

          (i) Negotiate or agree to amendments; and

          (ii) Consent to or approve other items as necessary.

          (2) The designated landowner or representative may not:

          (i) Negotiate or agree to amendments that reduce the grazing rental payments payable to the other Indian landowners; or

          (ii) Terminate the permit or modify the term of the permit.

          (c) We may approve a permit for tribal land to individual members of a tribe which contains a provision permitting the assignment of the permit by the permittee or the lender without our approval when a lending institution or an agency of the United States:

          (1) Accepts the interest in the permit (leasehold) as security for the loan; and

          (2) Obtains the interest in the permit (leasehold) through foreclosure or otherwise.

          (d) We will revise the grazing capacity and modify the permit.

          § 166.230   When will a BIA decision to approve an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage under a permit be effective?

#### § § 166.230

          Our decision to approve an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage under a permit will be effective immediately, notwithstanding any appeal which may be filed under Part 2 of this title. Copies of approved documents will be provided to the party requesting approval, and made available to the Indian landowners upon request.

          § 166.231   Must an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage approved under a permit be recorded?

#### § § 166.231

          An amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage approved under a permit must be recorded in our Land Titles and Records Office which has jurisdiction over the Indian land. We will record the document immediately following our approval.

      Subpart D—Land and Operations Management

        Management Plans and Environmental Compliance

          § 166.311   Is an Indian agricultural resource management plan required?

#### § § 166.311

          (a) Indian agricultural land under the jurisdiction of a tribe must be managed in accordance with the goals and objectives in any agricultural resource management plan developed by the tribe, or by us in close consultation with the tribe, under the AIARMA.

          (b) The ten-year agricultural resource management and monitoring plan must be developed through public meetings and completed within three years of the initiation of the planning activity. Such a plan must be developed through public meetings, and be based on the public meeting records and existing survey documents, reports, and other research from federal agencies, tribal community colleges, and land grant universities. When completed, the plan must:

          (1) Determine available agricultural resources;

          (2) Identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and objectives;

          (3) Establish management objectives for the resources;

          (4) Define critical values of the tribe and its members and provide identified holistic management objectives; and

          (5) Identify actions to be taken to reach established objectives.

          (c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a tribe's agricultural resource management plan, we may waive the regulations under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law.

          § 166.312   Is a conservation plan required?

#### § § 166.312

          A conservation plan must be developed for each permit with the permittee and approved by us prior to the issuance of the permit. The conservation plan must be consistent with the tribe's agricultural resource management plan and must address the permittee's management objectives regarding animal husbandry and resource conservation. The conservation plan must cover the entire permit period and reviewed by us on an annual basis.

          § 166.313   Is environmental compliance required?

#### § § 166.313

          Actions taken by the BIA under the regulations in this part must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 ), applicable regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500), and applicable tribal laws and regulations.

        Conservation Practices and Improvements

          § 166.314   Can a permittee apply a conservation practice on permitted Indian land?

#### § § 166.314

          Yes. A permittee can apply a conservation practice on permitted Indian land as long as the permittee has approval from the BIA and majority interest and the conservation practice is consistent with the conservation plan.

          § 166.315   Who is responsible for the completion and maintenance of a conservation practice if the permit expires or is canceled before the completion of the conservation practice?

#### § § 166.315

          Prior to undertaking a conservation practice, the BIA, landowner, and permittee will negotiate who will complete and maintain a conservation practice if the permit expires or is canceled before the conservation practice is completed. That conservation practice agreement will be reflected in the conservation plan and permit.

          § 166.316   Can a permittee construct improvements on permitted Indian land?

#### § § 166.316

          Improvements may be constructed on permitted Indian land if the permit contains a provision allowing improvements.

          § 166.317   What happens to improvements constructed on Indian lands when the permit has been terminated?

#### § § 166.317

          (a) If improvements are to be constructed on Indian land, the permit must contain a provision that improvements will either:

          (1) Remain on the land upon termination of the permit, in a condition that is in compliance with applicable codes, to become the property of the Indian landowner; or

          (2) Be removed and the land restored within a time period specified in the permit. The land must be restored as close as possible to the original condition prior to construction of such improvements. At the request of the permittee we may, at our discretion, grant an extension of time for the removal of improvements and restoration of the land for circumstances beyond the control of the permittee.

          (b) If the permittee fails to remove improvements within the time allowed in the permit, the permittee may forfeit the right to remove the improvements and the improvements may become the property of the Indian landowner or at the request of the Indian landowner, we will apply the bond for the removal of the improvement and restoration of the land.

        § 166.300   How is Indian agricultural land managed?

#### § § 166.300

        Tribes, individual Indian landowners, and the BIA will manage Indian agricultural land either directly or through contracts, compacts, cooperative agreements, or grants under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as amended).

        § 166.301   How is Indian land for grazing purposes described?

#### § § 166.301

        Indian land for grazing purposes should be described by legal description (e.g., aliquot parts, metes and bounds) or other acceptable description. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee status, the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should be identified in the description of the permitted land.

        § 166.302   How is a range unit created?

#### § § 166.302

        We create a range unit after we consult with the Indian landowners of rangeland, by designating units of compatible size, availability, and location.

        § 166.303   Can more than one parcel of Indian land be combined into one permit?

#### § § 166.303

        Yes. A permit may include more than one parcel of Indian land. Permits may include tribal land, individually-owned Indian land, or government land, or any combination thereof.

        § 166.304   Can there be more than one permit for each range unit?

#### § § 166.304

        Yes. There can be more than one permit for each range unit.

        § 166.305   When is grazing capacity determined?

#### § § 166.305

        Before we grant, modify, or approve a permit, in consultation with the Indian landowners, we will establish the total grazing capacity for each range unit based on the summation of each parcel's productivity. We will also establish the season(s) of use on Indian lands.

        § 166.306   Can the BIA adjust the grazing capacity?

#### § § 166.306

        Yes. In consultation with the Indian landowners or in the BIA's discretion based on good cause, we may adjust the grazing capacity using the best evaluation method(s) relevant to the ecological region.

        § 166.307   Will the grazing capacity be increased if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit?

#### § § 166.307

        No. You will not receive an increase in grazing capacity in the permit if you graze trust or non-trust rangeland in common with the permitted land. Grazing capacity will be established only for Indian land covered by your permit.

        § 166.308   Can the number of animals and/or season of use be modified on the permitted land if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands under an on-and-off grazing permit?

#### § § 166.308

        Yes. The number of animals and/or season of use may be modified on permitted Indian land with an on-and-off grazing permit only when a conservation plan includes the use of adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit and when that land is used in common with permitted land.

        § 166.309   Who determines livestock class and livestock ownership requirements on permitted Indian land?

#### § § 166.309

        (a) Tribes determine the class of livestock and livestock ownership requirements for livestock that may be grazed on range units composed entirely of tribal land or which include government land, subject to the grazing capacity prescribed by us under § 166.305 of this part.

        (b) For permits on range units containing, in whole or part, individually-owned Indian land, we will adopt the tribal determination in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 166.310   What must a permittee do to protect livestock from exposure to disease?

#### § § 166.310

        In accordance with applicable law, permittees must:

        (a) Vaccinate livestock;

        (b) Treat all livestock exposed to or infected with contagious or infectious diseases; and

        (c) Restrict the movement of exposed or infected livestock.

      Subpart E—Grazing Rental Rates, Payments, and Late Payment Collections

        Rental Rate Determination and Adjustment

          § 166.400   Who establishes grazing rental rates?

#### § § 166.400

          (a) For tribal lands, a tribe may establish a grazing rental rate that is less or more than the grazing rental rate established by us. We will assist a tribe to establish a grazing rental rate by providing the tribe with available information concerning the value of grazing on tribal lands.

          (b) We will establish the grazing rental rate by determining the fair annual rental for:

          (1) Individually-owned Indian lands; and

          (2) Tribes that have not established a rate under paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c) Indian landowners may give us written authority to grant grazing privileges on their individually-owned Indian land at a grazing rental rate that is:

          (1) Above the grazing rental rate set by us; or

          (2) Below the grazing rental rate set by us, subject to our approval, when the permittee is a member of the Indian landowner's immediate family as defined in this part.

          § 166.401   How does the BIA establish grazing rental rates?

#### § § 166.401

          An appraisal can be used to determine the rental value of real property. The development and reporting of the valuation will be completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). If an appraisal is not desired, competitive bids, negotiations, advertisements, or any other method can be used in conjunction with a market study, rent survey, or feasibility analysis developed in accordance with the USPAP.

          § 166.402   Why must the BIA determine the fair annual rental of Indian land?

#### § § 166.402

          The BIA must determine the fair annual rental of Indian land to:

          (a) Assist the Indian landowner in negotiating a permit with potential permittees; and

          (b) Enable us to determine whether a permit is in the best interests of the Indian landowner.

          § 166.403   Will the BIA ever grant or approve a permit at less than fair annual rental?

#### § § 166.403

          (a) We will grant a permit for grazing on individually-owned Indian land at less than fair annual rental if, after competitive bidding of the permit, we determine that such action would be in the best interests of the individual Indian landowners.

          (b) We may approve a permit for grazing on individually-owned Indian land at less than fair annual rental if:

          (1) The permit is for the Indian landowner's immediate family or co-owner; or

          (2) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          (c) We may approve a permit for grazing on tribal land at less than fair annual rental if the tribe sets the rate.

          § 166.404   Whose grazing rental rate will be applicable for a permit on tribal land?

#### § § 166.404

          The following grazing rental rate schedule will apply for tribal land:

          § 166.405   Whose grazing rental rate will be applicable for a permit on individually-owned Indian land?

#### § § 166.405

          The following grazing rental rate schedule will apply for individually-owned Indian land:

          § 166.406   Whose grazing rental rate will be applicable for a permit on government land?

#### § § 166.406

          The following grazing rental rate schedule will apply for government land:

          § 166.407   If a range unit consists of tribal and individually-owned Indian lands, what is the grazing rental rate?

#### § § 166.407

          The grazing rental rate for tribal land will be the rate set by the tribe. The grazing rental rate for individually-owned Indian land will be the grazing rental rate set by us.

          § 166.408   Is the grazing rental rate established by the BIA adjusted periodically?

#### § § 166.408

          Yes. To ensure that Indian landowners are receiving the fair annual return, we may adjust the grazing rental rate established by the BIA, based upon an appropriate valuation method, taking into account the value of improvements made under the permit, unless the permit provides otherwise, following the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.

          (a) We will:

          (1) Review the grazing rental rate prior to each anniversary date or when specified by the permit.

          (2) Provide you with written notice of any adjustment of the grazing rental rate 60 days prior to each anniversary date.

          (3) Allow the adjusted grazing rental rate to be less than the fair annual rental if we determine that such a rate is in the best interest of the Indian landowner.

          (b) If adjusted, the grazing rental rate will become effective on the next anniversary date of the permit.

          (c) These adjustments will be retroactive, if they are not made at the time specified in the permit.

          (d) For permits granted by tribes, we will consult with the granting tribe to determine whether an adjustment of the grazing rental payment should be made. The permit must be modified to document the granting tribe's waiver of the adjustment. A tribe may grant a permit without providing for a rental adjustment, if the tribe establishes such a policy under § 166.100(a)(4) of this part and negotiates such a permit.

        Rental Payments

          § 166.409   How is my grazing rental payment determined?

#### § § 166.409

          The grazing rental payment is the total of the grazing rental rate multiplied by the number of AUMs or acres covered by the permit.

          § 166.410   When are grazing rental payments due?

#### § § 166.410

          The initial grazing rental payment is due and payable as specified in the permit or 15 days after the BIA approves the permit, whichever is later. Subsequent payments are due as specified in the permit.

          § 166.411   Will a permittee be notified when a grazing rental payment is due?

#### § § 166.411

          Each permit states the schedule of rental payments agreed to by the parties. We will issue an invoice to the permittee 30 to 60 days prior to the rental payment due date.

          § 166.412   What if the permittee does not receive an invoice that a grazing rental payment is due?

#### § § 166.412

          If we fail to send an invoice or if we send an invoice and the permittee does not receive it, the permittee is still responsible for making timely payment of all amounts due under the permit.

          § 166.413   To whom are grazing rental payments made?

#### § § 166.413

          (a) A permit must specify whether grazing rental payments will be made directly to the Indian landowners or to us on behalf of the Indian landowners. If the permit provides for payment to be made directly to the Indian landowners, the permit must also require that the permittee retain specific documentation evidencing proof of payment, such as canceled checks, cash receipt vouchers, or copies of money orders or cashier's checks, consistent with the provisions of §§ 166.1000 and 166.1001 of this part.

          (b) Grazing rental payments made directly to the Indian landowners must be made to the parties specified in the permit, unless the permittee receives a notice of a change of ownership. Unless otherwise provided in the permit, grazing rental payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (c) A permit which provides for grazing rental payments to be made directly to the Indian landowners must also provide for such payments to be suspended and rent thereafter paid to us, rather than directly than to the Indian landowners, if:

          (1) An Indian landowner dies;

          (2) An Indian landowner requests that payment be made to us;

          (3) An Indian landowner is found by us to be in need of assistance in managing his/her financial affairs; or

          (4) We determine, in our discretion and after consultation with the Indian landowner(s), that direct payment should be discontinued.

          § 166.414   What forms of grazing rental payments are acceptable?

#### § § 166.414

          (a) When grazing rental payments are made directly to the Indian landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.

          (b) Payments made to us may be delivered in person or by mail. We will not accept cash, foreign currency, or third-party checks. We will accept:

          (1) Personal or business checks drawn on the account of the permittee;

          (2) Money orders;

          (3) Cashier's checks;

          (4) Certified checks; or

          (5) Electronic funds transfer payments.

          § 166.415   What will the BIA do if the permittee fails to make a direct payment to an Indian landowner?

#### § § 166.415

          Within five business days of the Indian landowner's notification to us that a payment has not been received, we will contact the permittee either in writing or by telephone requesting that the permittee provide documentation (e.g., canceled check, cash receipt voucher, copy of a money order or cashier's check) showing that payment has been made to the Indian landowner. If the permitee fails to provide such documentation, we will follow the procedures identified in § 166.419 of this part to collect the money on behalf of the Indian landowner or to cancel the permit.

          § 166.416   May a permittee make a grazing rental payment in advance of the due date?

#### § § 166.416

          Rent may be paid no more than 30 days in advance, unless otherwise specified in the permit.

          § 166.417   May an individual Indian landowner modify the terms of the permit on a fractionated tract for advance grazing rental payment?

#### § § 166.417

          No. An individual Indian landowner of a fractionated tract may not modify a permit to allow a grazing rental payment in advance of the due date specified in the initial approved permit.

          § 166.418   When is a grazing rental payment late?

#### § § 166.418

          A grazing rental payment is late if it is not received on or before the due date.

        Late Rental Payment Collections

          § 166.419   What will the BIA do if grazing rental payments are not made in the time and manner required by the permit?

#### § § 166.419

          (a) A permitee's failure to pay grazing rental payments in the time and manner required by a permit will be a violation of the permit, and a notice of violation will be issued under § 166.703 of this part. If the permit requires that grazing rental payments be made to us, we will send the permittee and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date on which the grazing rental payment was due. If the permit provides for payment directly to the Indian landowner(s), we will send the permittee and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the Indian landowner(s).

          (b) If a permittee fails to provide adequate proof of payment or cure the violation within the requisite time period described in § 166.704 of this part, and the amount due is not in dispute, we may immediately take action to recover the amount of the unpaid rent and any associated interest charges or late payment penalties. We may also cancel the permit under § 166.705 of this part, or invoke any other remedies available under the permit or applicable law, including collection on any available bond or referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection. An action to recover any unpaid amounts will not be conditioned on the prior cancellation of the permit or any further notice to the permittee, nor will such an action be precluded by a prior cancellation.

          (c) Partial payments may be accepted, under special circumstances, by the Indian landowners or us, but acceptance will not operate as a waiver with respect to any amounts remaining unpaid or any other existing permit violations. Unless otherwise provided in the permit, overpayments may be credited as an advance against future grazing rental payments.

          (d) If a personal or business check is dishonored, and a grazing rental payment is therefore not made by the due date, the failure to make the payment in a timely manner will be a violation of the permit, and a written notice of violation will be issued under § 166.703 of this part. Any payment made to cure such a default, and any future payments by the same permittee, must be made by one of the alternative payment methods listed in § 166.414(b) of this part.

          § 166.420   Will any special fees be assessed on delinquent grazing rental payments due under a permit?

#### § § 166.420

          The following special fees will be assessed if a grazing rental payment is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to any interest or late payment penalties which must be paid to the Indian landowners under a permit. The following special fees will be assessed to cover administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of the debt:

          § 166.421   If a permit is canceled for non-payment, does that extinguish the permittee's debt?

#### § § 166.421

          No. The permittee remains liable for any delinquent payment. No future permits will be issued until all outstanding debts related to Indian agricultural lands are paid.

        Compensation to Indian Landowners

          § 166.422   What does the BIA do with grazing rental payments received from permittees?

#### § § 166.422

          Unless arrangements for direct payment to the Indian landowners has been provided, the rent will be deposited to the appropriate account maintained by the Office of Trust Funds Management in accordance with part 115 of this title.

          § 166.423   How do Indian landowners receive grazing rental payments that the BIA has received from permittees?

#### § § 166.423

          Funds will be paid to the Indian landowners by the Office of Trust Funds Management in accordance with 25 CFR part 115.

          § 166.424   How will the BIA determine the grazing rental payment amount to be distributed to each Indian landowner?

#### § § 166.424

          Unless otherwise specified in the permit, the grazing rental payment will be distributed to each Indian landowner according to the forage production that each parcel of Indian land contributes to the permit, annual rental rate of each parcel, and the Indian landowner's interest in each parcel.

      Subpart F—Administrative and Tribal Fees

        § 166.500   Are there administrative fees for a permit?

#### § § 166.500

        Yes. We will charge an administrative fee before approving any permit, subpermit, assignment, encumbrance, modification, or other related document.

        § 166.501   How are annual administrative fees determined?

#### § § 166.501

        (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), we will charge a three percent (%) administrative fee based on the annual grazing rent.

        (b) The minimum administrative fee is $10.00 and the maximum administrative fee is $500.00.

        (c) If a tribe performs all or part of the administrative duties for this part, the tribe may establish, collect, and use reasonable fees to cover its costs associated with the performance of administrative duties.

        § 166.502   Are administrative fees refundable?

#### § § 166.502

        No. We will not refund administrative fees.

        § 166.503   May the BIA waive administrative fees?

#### § § 166.503

        Yes. We may waive the administrative fee for a justifiable reason.

        § 166.504   Are there any other administrative or tribal fees, taxes, or assessments that must be paid?

#### § § 166.504

        Yes. The permittee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and/or assessments associated with the use of the land as determined by us or by the tribe. Failure to make such payments will constitute a permit violation under subpart H of this part.

      Subpart G—Bonding and Insurance Requirements

        § 166.600   Must a permittee provide a bond for a permit?

#### § § 166.600

        Yes. A permittee, assignee or subpermittee must provide a bond for each permit interest acquired. Upon request by an Indian landowner, we may waive the bond requirement.

        § 166.601   How is the amount of the bond determined?

#### § § 166.601

        (a) The amount of the bond for each permit is based on the:

        (1) Value of one year's grazing rental payment;

        (2) Value of any improvements to be constructed;

        (3) Cost of performance of any additional obligations; and

        (4) Cost of performance of restoration and reclamation.

        (b) Tribal policy made applicable by § 166.100 of this part may establish or waive specific bond requirements for permits.

        § 166.602   What form of bonds will the BIA accept?

#### § § 166.602

        (a) We will only accept bonds in the following forms:

        (1) Cash;

        (2) Negotiable Treasury securities that:

        (i) Have a market value equal to the bond amount; and

        (ii) Are accompanied by a statement granting full authority to the BIA to sell such securities in case of a violation of the terms of the permit.

        (3) Certificates of deposit that indicate on their face that Secretarial approval is required prior to redemption by any party;

        (4) Irrevocable letters of credit (LOC) issued by federally-insured financial institutions authorized to do business in the United States. LOC's must:

        (i) Contain a clause that grants the BIA authority to demand immediate payment if the permittee defaults or fails to replace the LOC within 30 calendar days prior to its expiration date;

        (ii) Be payable to the “Department of the Interior, BIA”;

        (iii) Be irrevocable during its term and have an initial expiration date of not less than one year following the date we receive it; and

        (iv) Be automatically renewable for a period of not less than one year, unless the issuing financial institution provides the BIA with written notice at least 90 calendar days before the letter of credit's expiration date that it will not be renewed;

        (5) Surety bond; or

        (6) Any other form of highly liquid, non-volatile security subsequently approved by us that is easily convertible to cash by us and for which our approval is required prior to redemption by any party.

        (b) Indian landowners may negotiate a permit term that specifies the use of any of the bond forms described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) A tribe may accept and hold any form of bond described in paragraph (a) of this section, to secure performance under a permit of tribal land.

        § 166.603   If cash is submitted as a bond, how is it administered?

#### § § 166.603

        If cash is submitted as a bond, we will establish an account in the name of the permittee and retain it.

        § 166.604   Is interest paid on a cash performance bond?

#### § § 166.604

        No. Interest will not be paid on a cash performance bond.

        § 166.605   Are cash performance bonds refunded?

        If the cash performance bond has not been forfeited for cause, the amount deposited will be refunded to the depositor at the end of the permit period.

        § 166.606   What happens to a bond if a violation occurs?

#### § § 166.606

        We may apply the bond to remedy the violation, in which case we will require the permittee to submit a replacement bond of an appropriate amount.

        § 166.607   Is insurance required for a permit?

#### § § 166.607

        When we determine it to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners, we will require a permittee to provide insurance. If insurance is required, it must:

        (a) Be provided in an amount sufficient to:

        (1) Protect any improvements on the permit premises;

        (2) Cover losses such as personal injury or death; and

        (3) Protect the interest of the Indian landowner.

        (b) Identify the tribe, individual Indian landowners, and United States as insured parties.

        § 166.608   What types of insurance may be required?

#### § § 166.608

        We may require liability or casualty insurance (such as for fire, hazard, or flood), depending upon the activity conducted under the permit.

      Subpart H—Permit Violations

        § 166.700   What permit violations are addressed by this subpart?

#### § § 166.700

        This subpart addresses violations of permit provisions other than trespass. Trespass is addressed under subpart I of this part.

        § 166.701   How will the BIA determine whether the activities of a permittee under a permit are in compliance with the terms of the permit?

#### § § 166.701

        Unless the permit provides otherwise, we may enter the range unit at any reasonable time, without prior notice, to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and ensure that the permittee is in compliance with the operating requirements of the permit.

        § 166.702   Can a permit provide for negotiated remedies in the event of a permit violation?

#### § § 166.702

        (a) A permit of tribal land may provide the tribe with certain negotiated remedies in the event of a permit violation, including the power to terminate the permit. A permit of individually-owned Indian land may provide the individual Indian landowners with similar remedies, so long as the permit also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners. Any notice of violation must be provided by written notice.

        (b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to us under § 166.705(c) of this subpart. If the permit specifically authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for cancellation.

        (c) A permit may provide for permit disputes to be resolved in tribal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or through arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to any ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us under § 166.705 of this subpart.

        § 166.703   What happens if a permit violation occurs?

#### § § 166.703

        (a) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific permit violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation within five business days of that notification.

        (b) If we determine that a permit violation has occurred based on facts known to us, we will provide written notice to the permittee and the sureties of the violation within five business days.

        § 166.704   What will a written notice of a permit violation contain?

#### § § 166.704

        The written notice of a permit violation will provide the permittee with ten days from the receipt of the written notice to:

        (a) Cure the permit violation and notify us that the violation is cured.

        (b) Explain why we should not cancel the permit; or

        (c) Request in writing additional time to complete corrective actions. If additional time is granted, we may require that certain corrective actions be taken immediately.

        § 166.705   What will the BIA do if a permit violation is not cured within the required time period?

#### § § 166.705

        (a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether:

        (1) The permit should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 166.706 through 166.707 of this subpart;

        (2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the permit, including collecting on any available bond;

        (3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or

        (4) The permittee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

        (b) If we decide to grant a permittee additional time in which to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time period from the date on which the extension is granted.

        (c) If we decide to cancel the permit, we will send the permittee and its sureties a written notice of cancellation within five business days of that decision. We will also provide actual or constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:

        (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

        (2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest charges, or late payment penalties due under the permit;

        (3) Notify the permittee of its right to appeal under Part 2 of this chapter, as modified by § 166.706 of this subpart, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

        (4) Order the permittee to vacate the property within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written notice of cancellation, if an appeal is not filed by that time.

        § 166.706   Will the BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds apply to cancellation decisions involving permits?

#### § § 166.706

        (a) The appeal bond provisions in § 2.5 of part 2 of this chapter will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decisions made under § 166.705 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to cancel a permit, we may require the permittee to post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in part 2 of this chapter.

        (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the permit cancellation decision.

        § 166.707   When will a cancellation of a permit be effective?

#### § § 166.707

        A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the permittee files an appeal under § 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of cancellation from us.

        § 166.708   Can the BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is threatened with immediate, significant, and irreparable harm?

#### § § 166.708

        Yes. If a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Indian land during the term of a permit, we will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart I of this part, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Indian landowners, either before or after the emergency action is taken.

        § 166.709   What will the BIA do if a permittee holds over after the expiration or cancellation of a permit?

#### § § 166.709

        If a permittee remains in possession of Indian land after the expiration or cancellation of a permit, we will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the permittee is engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new permit, we will take action to recover possession of the Indian land on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, including the assessment of civil penalties and costs under subpart I of this part.

      Subpart I—Trespass

        Notification

          § 166.803   How are trespassers notified of a trespass determination?

#### § § 166.803

          (a) Unless otherwise provided under tribal law, when we have reason to believe that a trespass on Indian agricultural land has occurred, within five business days, we or the authorized tribal representative will provide written notice to the alleged trespasser, the possessor of trespass property, any known lien holder, and beneficial Indian landowner, as appropriate. The written notice will include the following:

          (1) The basis for the trespass determination;

          (2) A legal description of where the trespass occurred;

          (6) Potential consequences and penalties for failure to take corrective action; and

          (7) A statement that unauthorized livestock or other property may not be removed or disposed of unless authorized by us.

          (b) If we determine that the alleged trespasser or possessor of trespass property is unknown or refuses delivery of the written notice, a public trespass notice will be posted at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and published in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring.

          (c) Trespass notices under this subpart are not subject to appeal under 25 CFR part 2.

          § 166.804   What can I do if I receive a trespass notice?

#### § § 166.804

          (a) Comply with the ordered corrective actions; or

          (b) Contact us in writing to explain why the trespass notice is in error. You may contact us by telephone but any explanation of trespass you wish to provide must be in writing. If we determine that we issued the trespass notice in error, we will withdraw the notice.

          § 166.805   How long will a written trespass notice remain in effect?

#### § § 166.805

          A written trespass notice will remain in effect for the same conduct identified in that written notice for a period of one year from the date of receipt of the written notice by the trespasser.

        Actions

          § 166.806   What actions does the BIA take against trespassers?

          (a) Seize, impound, sell or dispose of unauthorized livestock or other property involved in the trespass. We may keep such property we seize for use as evidence.

          (b) Assess penalties, damages, and costs, under § 166.812 of this subpart.

          § 166.807   When will we impound unauthorized livestock or other property?

#### § § 166.808

          (a) If the trespass is not corrected in the time specified in the initial trespass notice, we will send written notice of our intent to impound unauthorized livestock or other property to the unauthorized livestock or property owner or representative, and any known lien holder of the unauthorized livestock or other property.

          (b) If we determine that the owner of the unauthorized livestock or other property or the owner's representative is unknown or refuses delivery of the written notice, we will post a public notice of intent to impound at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and published in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring.

          (c) After we have given notice as described above, we will impound unauthorized livestock or other property without any further notice.

          § 166.809   What happens after my unauthorized livestock or other property are impounded?

#### § § 166.809

          Following the impoundment of unauthorized livestock or other property, we will provide notice that we will sell the impounded property as follows:

          (a) We will provide written notice of the sale to the owner, the owner's representative, and any known lien holder. The written notice must include the procedure by which the impounded property may be redeemed prior to the sale.

          (b) We will provide public notice of sale of impounded property by posting at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and publishing in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring. The public notice will include a description of the impounded property, and the date, time, and place of the public sale. The sale date must be at least five days after the publication and posting of notice.

          § 166.810   How do I redeem my impounded livestock or other property?

          § 166.817   What happens if I do not pay the assessed penalties, damages and costs?

#### § § 166.817

          Unless otherwise provided by applicable tribal law:

          (a) We will refuse to issue you a permit for use, development, or occupancy of Indian agricultural lands; and

          (b) We will forward your case for appropriate legal action.

          § 166.818   How are the proceeds from trespass distributed?

#### § § 166.818

          Unless otherwise provided by tribal law:

        § 166.800   What is trespass?

#### § § 166.800

        Under this part, trespass is any unauthorized occupancy, use of, or action on Indian agricultural lands. These provisions also apply to Indian agricultural land managed under an agricultural lease or permit under part 162 of this title.

#### § § 167.9

      (a) All livestock grazed on the Navajo Reservation must be covered by an authorized grazing permit issued by the Superintendent based upon the recommendations of the District Grazing Committee. All such grazing permits will be automatically renewed annually until terminated. District Grazing Committees shall act on all grazing permit changes resulting from negotiability within their respective Districts. The number of livestock that may be grazed under each permit shall be the number originally permitted plus or minus any changes as indicated by Transfer Agreements and Court Judgment Orders.

      (b) Any permittee who has five or more horses on his current permit will be required to apply any acquired sheep units in classes of stock other than horses. If the purchaser wishes more than his present number of horses, he must have his needs evaluated by the District Grazing Committee. Yearling colts will be counted against permitted number on all permits with six or more horses. Yearling colts will not be counted against permitted number on all permits with less than six horses. In hardship cases the District Grazing Committee may reissue horses removed from grazing permits through negotiability to permit holders who are without sufficient horses on their present permits to meet minimum needs.

      (c) No permittee shall be authorized to graze more than ten head of horses or to accumulate a total of over 350 sheep units.

      (d) Upon recommendation of the District Grazing Committee and with the approval of the Superintendent, grazing permits may be transferred from one permittee to another in accordance with instructions provided by the Advisory Committee of the Navajo Tribal Council, or may be inherited; provided that the permitted holdings of any individual permittee shall not exceed 350 sheep units or the equivalent thereof. Should inheritance or other acquisition of permits increase the holdings of any permittee to more than 350 sheep units, said permittee shall dispose of all livestock in excess of 350 sheep units not later than November 15 following date of inheritance or other acquisition, and that portion of his or her permit in excess of 350 sheep units within one year from date of inheritance.

      (e) By request of a permittee to sublet all or a part of his or her regular grazing permit to a member of his family or to any person who would receive such permit by inheritance, such subletting of permits may be authorized by the District Grazing Committee and the Superintendent or his authorized representative.

      § 167.10   Special grazing permits.

#### § § 167.10

      The problem of special grazing permits shall be settled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs working in cooperation with the Tribal Council, or any Committee designated by it, with a view to terminating these permits at a suitable date and with the least hardship to the Indians concerned.

      § 167.11   Tenure of grazing permits.

#### § § 167.11

      (a) All active regular grazing permits shall be for one year and shall be automatically renewed annually until terminated. Any Navajo eligible to hold a grazing permit as defined in § 167.8 may become a livestock operator by obtaining an active grazing permit through negotiability or inheritance or both.

      (b) In many Districts, and portions of all districts, unused grazing permits or portions of grazing permits are beneficial in aiding range recovery. Each District Grazing Committee will handle each matter of unused grazing permit or portions of grazing permits on individual merits. Where ample forage is available operators will be encouraged to fill their permits with livestock or dispose of their unused permits through negotiability. In those areas where forage is in need of rehabilitation permittees will not be encouraged to stock to their permitted numbers until the range has sufficiently recovered to justify the grazing of additional livestock.

      § 167.12   Grazing fees.

#### § § 167.15

      (a) The District Grazing Committees with the approval of the Superintendent shall require livestock to be dipped, vaccinated, inspected and be restricted in movement when necessary to prevent the introduction and spread of contagious or infectious disease in the economic interest of the Navajo stock owners. Upon the recommendation of the District Grazing Committee livestock shall be dipped annually when such dipping is necessary to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These annual dippings shall be completed on or before September 1st each year. Livestock, however, may be dipped at other times when necessary.

All enclosures fenced for the purpose of protecting agricultural land shall be kept to a size commensurate with the needs for protection of agricultural land and must be enclosed by legal four strand barbed wire fence or the equivalent.

      § 167.17   Construction near permanent livestock water developments.

#### § § 167.17

      (a) The District Grazing Committee shall regulate the construction of all dwellings, corrals and other structures within one-half mile of Government or Navajo Tribal developed permanent livestock waters such as springs, wells, and charcos or deep reservoirs.

    PART 169—RIGHTS-OF-WAY OVER INDIAN LAND

### Part 169

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 25 U.S.C. 323-328; 25 U.S.C. 2201

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 72534, Nov. 19, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Purpose, Definitions, General Provisions

        § 169.1   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 169.1

        (a) This part is intended to streamline the procedures and conditions under which BIA will consider a request to approve ( grant) rights-of-way over and across tribal lands, individually owned Indian lands, and BIA lands, by providing for the use of the broad authority under 25 U.S.C. 323-328, rather than the limited authorities under other statutes. This part is also intended to support tribal self-determination and self-governance by acknowledging and incorporating tribal law and policies in processing a request for a right-of-way across tribal lands and defer to the maximum extent possible to Indian landowner decisions regarding their Indian land.

        (b) This part specifies:

        (1) Conditions and authorities under which we will consider a request to approve rights-of-way over or across Indian land;

        (2) How to obtain a right-of-way;

        (3) Terms and conditions required in rights-of-way;

        (4) How we administer and enforce rights-of-ways;

        (5) How to renew, amend, assign, and mortgage rights-of-way; and

        (6) Whether rights-of-way are required for service line agreements.

        (c) This part does not cover rights-of-way over or across tribal lands within a reservation for the purpose of Federal Power Act projects, such as constructing, operating, or maintaining dams, water conduits, reservoirs, powerhouses, transmission lines, or other works which must constitute a part of any project for which a license is required by the Federal Power Act.

        (1) The Federal Power Act provides that any license that must be issued to use tribal lands within a reservation must be subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such lands (16 U.S.C. 797(e)).

        (2) In the case of tribal lands belonging to a tribe organized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. 476), the Federal Power Act requires that annual charges for the use of such tribal lands under any license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must be subject to the approval of the tribe (16 U.S.C. 803(e)).

        (d) This part does not apply to grants of rights-of-way on tribal land under a special act of Congress specifically authorizing rights-of-way on tribal land without our approval.

        § 169.2   What terms do I need to know?

#### § § 169.2

#### § § 169.10

        A right-of-way is a non-possessory interest in land, and title does not pass to the grantee. The Secretary's grant of a right-of-way will clarify that it does not diminish to any extent:

        (a) The Indian tribe's jurisdiction over the land subject to, and any person or activity within, the right-of-way;

        (2) Activities under a right-of-way grant are not subject to any fee, tax, assessment, levy, or other charge (e.g., business use, privilege, public utility, excise, gross revenue taxes) imposed by any State or political subdivision of a State; and

        (3) The right-of-way interest is not subject to any fee, tax, assessment, levy, or other charge imposed by any State or political subdivision of a State.

        (b) For purposes of appeals from BIA decisions under this part, “interested party” is defined as any person whose land is subject to the right-of-way or located adjacent to or in close proximity to the right-of-way whose own direct economic interest is adversely affected by an action or decision.

        § 169.14   How does the Paperwork Reduction Act affect this part?

      Subpart B—Service Line Agreements

        § 169.51   Is a right-of-way required for service lines?

#### § § 169.51

        Service lines generally branch off from facilities for which a right-of-way must be obtained. A service line is a utility line running from a main line, transmission line, or distribution line that is used only for supplying telephone, water, electricity, gas, internet service, or other utility service to a house, business, or other structure. In the case of a power line, a service line is limited to a voltage of 14.5 kv or less, or a voltage of 34.5 kv or less if serving irrigation pumps and commercial and industrial uses. To obtain access to Indian land for service lines, the right-of-way grantee must file a service line agreement meeting the requirements of this subpart with BIA.

        § 169.52   What is a service line agreement?

#### § § 169.52

        Service line agreements are agreements signed by a utility provider and landowners for the purpose of providing limited access to supply the owners (or authorized occupants or users) of one tract of tribal or individually owned Indian land with utilities for use by such owners (or occupants or users) on the premises.

        § 169.53   What should a service line agreement address?

#### § § 169.53

        A service line agreement should address what utility services the provider will supply, to whom, and other appropriate details. The service line agreement should also address the mitigation of any damages incurred during construction and the restoration (or reclamation, if agreed to by the owners or authorized occupants or users) of the premises at the termination of the agreement.

        § 169.54   What are the consent requirements for service line agreements?

#### § § 169.54

        (a) Before the utility provider may begin any work to construct service lines across tribal land, the utility provider and the tribe (or the legally authorized occupants or users of the tribal land and upon request, the tribe) must execute a service line agreement.

        (b) Before the utility provider may begin any work to construct service lines across individually owned land, the utility provider and the owners (or the legally authorized occupants or users) must execute a service line agreement.

        § 169.55   Is a valuation required for service line agreements?

#### § § 169.55

        We do not require a valuation for service line agreements.

#### § § 169.56

        The parties must file an executed copy of service line agreements, together with a plat or diagram, with us within 30 days after the date of execution for recording in the LTRO. The plat or diagram must show the boundary of the ownership parcel and point of connection of the service line with the distribution line. When the plat or diagram is placed on a separate sheet it must include the signatures of the parties.

      Subpart C—Obtaining a Right-of-Way

        Application

          § 169.101   How do I obtain a right-of-way across tribal or individually owned Indian land or BIA land?

#### § § 169.101

          (a) To obtain a right-of-way across tribal or individually owned Indian land or BIA land, you must submit a complete application to the BIA office with jurisdiction over the land covered by the right-of-way.

          (b) If you must obtain access to Indian land to prepare information required by the application (e.g., to survey), you must obtain the consent of the Indian landowners, but our approval to access is not required. Upon written request, we will provide you with the names, addresses, and percentage of ownership of individual Indian landowners, to allow you to obtain the landowners' consent to survey.

          (c) If the BIA will be granting the right-of-way across Indian land under § 169.107(b), then the BIA may grant permission to access the land.

          § 169.102   What must an application for a right-of-way include?

          (3) Bond(s), insurance, and/or other security meeting the requirements of § 169.103;

          (4) Record that notice of the right-of-way was provided to all Indian landowners;

          (5) Record of consent for the right-of-way meeting the requirements of § 169.107, or a statement requesting a right-of-way without consent under § 169.107(b);

          (6) If applicable, a valuation meeting the requirements of § 169.114;

          (7) If the applicant is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, or other legal entity, except a tribal entity, information such as organizational documents, certificates, filing records, and resolutions, demonstrating that:

          (8) Environmental and archaeological reports, surveys, and site assessments, as needed to facilitate compliance with applicable Federal and tribal environmental and land use requirements; and

          (9) A statement from the appropriate tribal authority that the proposed use is in conformance with applicable tribal law, if required by the tribe.

          (c) There is no standard application form.

          § 169.103   What bonds, insurance, or other security must accompany the application?

#### § § 169.103

          (a) You must include payment of bonds, insurance, or alternative forms of security with your application for a right-of-way in amounts that cover:

          (1) The highest annual rental specified in the grant, unless compensation is a one-time payment;

          (2) The estimated damages resulting from the construction of any permanent improvements;

          (3) The estimated damages and remediation costs from any potential release of contaminants, explosives, hazardous material or waste;

          (4) The operation and maintenance charges for any land located within an irrigation project;

          (5) The restoration of the premises to their condition at the start of the right-of-way or reclamation to some other specified condition if agreed to by the landowners.

          (b) The bond or other security must be deposited with us and made payable only to us, and may not be modified without our approval, except for tribal land in which case the bond or security may be deposited with and made payable to the tribe, and may not be modified without the approval of the tribe. Any insurance must identify both the Indian landowners and the United States as additional insured parties.

          (c) The grant will specify the conditions under which we may adjust the bond, insurance, or security requirements to reflect changing conditions, including consultation with the tribal landowner for tribal land before the adjustment.

          (d) We may require that the surety provide any supporting documents needed to show that the bond, insurance, or alternative form of security will be enforceable, and that the surety will be able to perform the guaranteed obligations.

          (e) The bond, insurance, or other security instrument must require the surety to provide notice to us, and the tribe for tribal land, at least 60 days before canceling a bond, insurance, or other security. This will allow us to notify the grantee of its obligation to provide a substitute bond, insurance, or other security before the cancellation date. Failure to provide a substitute bond, insurance or security is a violation of the right-of-way.

          (f) We may waive the requirement for a bond, insurance, or alternative form of security:

          (1) For individually owned Indian land, if the Indian landowners of the majority of the interests request it and we determine, in writing, that a waiver is in the Indian landowners' best interest considering the purpose of and risks associated with the right-of-way, or if the grantee is a utility cooperative and is providing a direct benefit to the Indian land or is a tribal utility.

          (2) For tribal land, deferring, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver of a bond, insurance or alternative form of security is in its best interest.

          (1) Certificates of deposit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (2) Irrevocable letters of credit issued by a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in the United States;

          (h) We may accept an alternative form of security approved by us that provides adequate protection for the Indian landowners and us, including but not limited to an escrow agreement or an assigned savings account.

          (i) All forms of bonds or alternative security must, if applicable:

          (1) State on their face that BIA approval is required for redemption;

          (2) Be accompanied by a statement granting full authority to BIA to make an immediate claim upon or sell them if the grantee violates the terms of the right-of-way grant;

          (k) The requirements of this section do not apply to Federal, State, Tribal, or local governments who are prohibited by law from providing a bond, insurance, or other security. Federal, State, Tribal, or local governments seeking this exemption must include with their application a certification, including a citation to applicable law, that they are prohibited by law from providing security. Federal, State, Tribal, or local governments must also notify landowners that they are prohibited by law from providing security when they notify the Indian landowners of their application under § 169.107.

          § 169.104   What is the release process for a bond or alternative form of security?

#### § § 169.104

          Upon satisfaction of the requirements for which the bond was security, or upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the right-of-way, the grantee may ask BIA in writing to release all or part of the bond or alternative form of security and release the grantee from the obligation to maintain insurance. Upon receiving the grantee's request, BIA will:

          (a) Confirm with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, that the grantee has complied with all applicable grant obligations; and

          (b) Release all or part of the bond or alternative form of security to the grantee, unless we determine that the bond or security must be redeemed to fulfill the contractual obligations.

          § 169.105   What requirements for due diligence must a right-of-way grant include?

#### § § 169.105

          (a) If permanent improvements are to be constructed, the right-of-way grant must include due diligence requirements that require the grantee to complete construction of any permanent improvements within the schedule specified in the right-of-way grant or general schedule of construction, and a process for changing the schedule by mutual consent of the parties. If construction does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in the grant, the grantee must provide the Indian landowners and BIA with an explanation of good cause as to the nature of any delay, the anticipated date of construction of facilities, and evidence of progress toward commencement of construction.

          (b) Failure of the grantee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the grant is a violation of the grant and may lead to cancellation of the right-of-way under § 169.405 or § 169.408.

          (c) BIA may waive the requirements in this section if we determine, in writing, that a waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

        Consent Requirements

          § 169.106   How does an applicant identify and contact individual Indian landowners to negotiate a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.106

          (a) Applicants may submit a written request to us to obtain the following information. The request must specify that it is for the purpose of negotiating a right-of-way:

          (1) Names and addresses of the individual Indian landowners or their representatives;

          (2) Information on the location of the parcel; and

          (3) The percentage of undivided interest owned by each individual Indian landowner.

          (b) We may assist applicants in contacting the individual Indian landowners or their representatives for the purpose of negotiating a right-of-way, upon request.

          (c) We will attempt to assist individual Indian landowners in right-of-way negotiations, upon their request.

          § 169.107   Must I obtain tribal or individual Indian landowner consent for a right-of-way across Indian land?

#### § § 169.107

          (a) For a right-of-way across tribal land, the applicant must obtain tribal consent, in the form of a tribal authorization and a written agreement with the tribe, if the tribe so requires, to a grant of right-of-way across tribal land. The consent document may impose restrictions or conditions; any restrictions or conditions automatically become conditions and restrictions in the grant.

          (b) For a right-of-way across individually owned Indian land, the applicant must notify all individual Indian landowners and, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, must obtain written consent from the owners of the majority interest in each tract affected by the grant of right-of-way.

          (1) We may issue the grant of right-of-way without the consent of any of the individual Indian owners if all of the following conditions are met:

          (i) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that it would be impracticable to obtain consent as defined in paragraph (c) of this section;

          (ii) We determine the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any landowner, based on factors including, but not limited to, the reasonableness of the term of the grant, the amount of acreage involved in the grant, the disturbance to land that will result from the grant, the type of activity to be conducted under the grant, the potential for environmental or safety impacts resulting from the grant, and any objections raised by landowners;

          (iii) We determine that all of the landowners will be adequately compensated for consideration and any damages that may arise from a grant of right-of-way; and

          (iv) We provide notice of our intent to issue the grant of right-of-way to all of the owners at least 60 days prior to the date of the grant using the procedures in § 169.12, and provide landowners with 30 days to object.

          (2) For the purposes of this section, the owners of interests in the land are so numerous that it would be impracticable to obtain consent, if there are 50 or more co-owners of undivided trust or restricted interests.

          (3) Successors are bound by consent granted by their predecessors-in-interest.

          (c) We will determine the number of owners of, and undivided interests in, a fractionated tract of Indian land, for the purposes of calculating the requisite consent based on our records on the date on which the application is submitted to us.

          § 169.108   Who is authorized to consent to a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.108

          (a) Indian tribes, adult Indian landowners, and emancipated minors, may consent to a right-of-way over or across their land, including undivided interests in fractionated tracts.

          (b) The following individuals or entities may consent on behalf of an individual Indian landowner:

          (1) An adult with legal custody acting on behalf of his or her minor children;

          (2) A guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to act on behalf of an individual Indian landowner;

          (3) Any person who is authorized to practice before the Department of the Interior under 43 CFR 1.3(b) and has been retained by the Indian landowner for this purpose;

          (4) BIA, under the circumstances in paragraph (c) of this section; or

          (5) An adult or legal entity who has been given a written power of attorney that:

          (i) Meets all of the formal requirements of any applicable law under § 169.9;

          (ii) Identifies the attorney-in-fact; and

          (iii) Describes the scope of the powers granted, to include granting rights-of-way on land or generally conveying or encumbering interests in Indian land, and any limits on those powers.

          (c) BIA may give written consent to a right-of-way on behalf of an individual Indian landowner, as long as we determine that the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any landowner, based on factors including, but not limited to, the amount of acreage involved in the grant, the disturbance to land that will result from the grant, the type of activity to be conducted under the grant, the potential for environmental or safety impacts resulting from the grant, and any objections raised by landowners. BIA's consent must be counted in the majority interest under § 169.107, on behalf of:

          (1) An individual Indian landowner, if the owner is deceased, and the heirs to, or devisees of, the interest of the deceased owner have not been determined;

          (2) An individual Indian landowner whose whereabouts are unknown to us, after we make a reasonable attempt to locate the individual;

          (3) An individual Indian landowner who is found to be non compos mentis or determined to be an adult in need of assistance who does not have a guardian duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an individual under legal disability as defined in part 115 of this chapter;

          (4) An individual Indian landowner who is an orphaned minor and who does not have a guardian duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction; and

          (5) An individual Indian landowner who has given us a written power of attorney to consent to a right-of-way over or across their land.

          § 169.109   Whose consent do I need for a right-of-way when there is a life estate on the tract?

#### § § 169.109

          If there is a life estate on the tract that would be subject to the right-of-way, the applicant must get the consent of both the life tenant and the owners of the majority of the remainder interest known at the time of the application.

        Compensation Requirements

          § 169.110   How much monetary compensation must be paid for a right-of-way over or across tribal land?

#### § § 169.110

          (a) A right-of-way over or across tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation if the tribe submits a tribal authorization expressly stating that it:

          (1) Has agreed upon compensation satisfactory to the tribe;

          (2) Waives valuation; and

          (3) Has determined that accepting such agreed-upon compensation and waiving valuation is in its best interest.

          (b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market value, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 169.114. After providing the tribe with the fair market value, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any compensation negotiated by the tribe.

          (c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the grantee pay fair market value based on a valuation in accordance with § 169.114.

          § 169.111   Must a right-of-way grant for tribal land provide for compensation reviews or adjustments?

#### § § 169.111

          For a right-of-way grant over or across tribal land, no periodic review of the adequacy of compensation or adjustment is required, unless the tribe negotiates for reviews or adjustments.

          § 169.112   How much monetary compensation must be paid for a right-of-way over or across individually owned Indian land?

#### § § 169.112

          (a) A right-of-way over or across individually owned Indian land must require compensation of not less than fair market value, unless paragraph (b) or (c) of this section permit a lesser amount. Compensation may also include additional fees, including but not limited to throughput fees, severance damages, franchise fees, avoidance value, bonuses, or other factors. Compensation may be based on a fixed amount, a percentage of the projected income, or some other method. The grant must establish how the fixed amount, percentage, or combination will be calculated and the frequency at which the payments will be made.

          (b) We may approve a right-of-way over or across individually owned Indian land that provides for nominal compensation, or compensation less than a fair market value, if:

          (1) The grantee is a utility cooperative and is providing a direct benefit to the Indian land; or

          (2) The grantee is a tribal utility; or

          (3) The individual Indian landowners execute a written waiver of the right to receive fair market value and we determine it is in the individual Indian landowners' best interest, based on factors including, but not limited to:

          (i) The grantee is a member of the immediate family, as defined in § 169.2, of an individual Indian landowner;

          (ii) The grantee is a co-owner in the affected tract;

          (iii) A special relationship or circumstances exist that we believe warrant approval of the right-of-way; or

          (iv) We have waived the requirement for a valuation under paragraph (d) of this section.

          (c) We will require a valuation to determine fair market value, unless:

          (1) 100 percent of the individual Indian landowners submit to us a written request to waive the valuation requirement; or

          (2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (d) of this section.

          (d) The grant must provide that the non-consenting individual Indian landowners, and those on whose behalf we have consented under § 169.108(c), or granted the right-of-way without consent under § 169.107(b), receive fair market value, as determined by a valuation, unless:

          (1) The grantee is a utility cooperative and is providing a direct benefit to the Indian land; or

          (2) The grantee is a tribal utility; or

          (3) We waive the requirement because the tribe or grantee will construct infrastructure improvements benefitting the individual Indian landowners, and we determine in writing that the waiver is in the best interest of all the landowners.

          § 169.113   Must a right-of-way grant for individually owned Indian land provide for compensation reviews or adjustments?

#### § § 169.113

          (a) For a right-of-way grant of individually owned Indian land, a review of the adequacy of compensation must occur at least every fifth year, in the manner specified in the grant unless:

          (1) Payment is a one-time lump sum;

          (2) The term of the right-of-way grant is 5 years or less;

          (3) The grant provides for automatic adjustments; or

          (4) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners not to require a review or automatic adjustment based on circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:

          (i) The right-of-way grant provides for payment of less than fair market value;

          (ii) The right-of-way grant provides for most or all of the compensation to be paid during the first 5 years of the grant term or before the date the review would be conducted; or

          (iii) The right-of-way grant provides for graduated rent or non-monetary or varying types of compensation.

          (b) The grant must specify:

          (1) When adjustments take effect;

          (2) Who can make adjustments;

          (3) What the adjustments are based on; and

          (4) How to resolve disputes arising from the adjustments.

          (c) When a review results in the need for adjustment of compensation, the Indian landowners must consent to the adjustment in accordance with § 169.107, unless the grant provides otherwise.

          § 169.114   How will BIA determine fair market value for a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.114

          (a) We will use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine the fair market value before we grant a right-of-way over or across individually owned Indian land. We will also use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine, at the request of the tribe, the fair market value of tribal land.

          (b) We will either:

          (1) Prepare, or have prepared, a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method; or

          (2) Approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method from the Indian landowners or grantee.

          (c) We will use or approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method only if it:

          (1) Has been prepared in accordance with USPAP or a valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214 and complies with Departmental policies regarding appraisals, including third-party appraisals; or

          (2) Has been prepared by another Federal agency.

          § 169.115   When are monetary compensation payments due under a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.115

          Compensation for a right-of-way may be a one-time, lump sum payment, or may be paid in increments (for example, annually).

          (a) If compensation is a one-time, lump sum payment, the grantee must make the payment by the date we grant the right-of-way, unless stated otherwise in the grant.

          (b) If compensation is to be paid in increments, the right-of-way grant must specify the dates on which all payments are due. Payments are due at the time specified in the grant, regardless of whether the grantee receives an advance billing or other notice that a payment is due. Increments may not be more frequent than quarterly if payments are made to us on the Indian landowners' behalf.

          § 169.116   Must a right-of-way specify who receives monetary compensation payments?

#### § § 169.116

          (a) A right-of-way grant must specify whether the grantee will make payments directly to the Indian landowners (direct pay) or to us on their behalf.

          (b) The grantee may make payments directly to the tribe if the tribe so chooses. The grantee may make payments directly to the Indian landowners if:

          (1) The Indian landowners' trust accounts are unencumbered accounts;

          (2) There are 10 or fewer beneficial owners; and

          (3) One hundred percent of the beneficial owners (including those on whose behalf we have consented) agree to receive payment directly from the grantee at the start of the right-of-way.

          (c) If the right-of-way document provides that the grantee will directly pay the Indian landowners, then:

          (1) The right-of-way document must include provisions for proof of payment upon our request.

          (2) When we consent on behalf of an Indian landowner, the grantee must make payment to us on behalf of that landowner.

          (3) The grantee must send direct payments to the parties and addresses specified in the right-of-way, unless the grantee receives notice of a change of ownership or address.

          (4) Unless the right-of-way document provides otherwise, payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.

          (5) Direct payments must continue through the duration of the right-of-way, except that:

          (i) The grantee must make all Indian landowners' payments to us if 100 percent of the Indian landowners agree to suspend direct pay and provide us with documentation of their agreement; and

          (ii) The grantee must make an individual Indian landowner's payment to us if that individual Indian landowner dies, is declared non compos mentis, owes a debt resulting in an encumbered account, or his or her whereabouts become unknown.

          § 169.117   What form of monetary compensation is acceptable under a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.117

          (a) If payments are made to us on behalf of the Indian landowners, our preferred method of payment is electronic funds transfer payments. We will also accept:

          (1) Money orders;

          (2) Personal checks;

          (3) Certified checks; or

          (4) Cashier's checks.

          (b) We will not accept cash or foreign currency.

          (c) We will accept third-party checks only from financial institutions or Federal agencies.

          (d) The grant of right-of-way will specify the payment method if payments are made by direct pay.

          § 169.118   May the right-of-way provide for non-monetary or varying types of compensation?

#### § § 169.118

          (a) A right-of-way grant may provide for alternative forms of compensation and varying types of compensation, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

          (1) Alternative forms of compensation may include but are not limited to, in-kind consideration and payments based on throughput or percentage of income; or

          (2) Varying types of compensation may include but are not limited to different types of payments at specific stages during the life of the right-of-way grant, such as fixed annual payments during construction, payments based on income during an operational period, and bonuses.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the compensation under paragraph (a) of this section is in its best interest, if the tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the alternative form of compensation or varying type of compensation to be in its best interest.

          (c) For individually owned land, we may grant a right-of-way that provides for an alternative form of compensation or varying type of compensation if we determine that it is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

          § 169.119   Will BIA notify a grantee when a payment is due for a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.119

          Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a grantee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under the right-of-way. The grantee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not issued, delivered, or received.

          § 169.120   What other types of payments are required for a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.120

          (a) The grantee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and assessments associated with the application for use of the land or use of the land, as determined by entities having jurisdiction, except as provided in § 169.11. The grantee must pay these amounts to the appropriate office, as applicable.

          (b) In addition to, or as part of, the compensation for a right-of-way under §§ 169.110 and 169.112 and the payments provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant for a right-of-way will be required to pay for all damages to the land, such as those incident to the construction or maintenance of the facility for which the right-of-way is granted.

          § 169.121   How will compensation be distributed among the life tenants and owners of the remainder interests?

#### § § 169.121

          If a will created the life estate and specifies how the compensation will be distributed among the life tenants and owners of the remainder interests, those terms will establish the distribution. Otherwise:

          (a) The owners of the remainder interests and the life tenant may enter into a right-of-way or other written agreement approved by the Secretary providing for the distribution of rent monies under the right-of-way; or

          (b) If the owners of the remainder interests and life tenant did not enter into an agreement for distribution, the life tenant will receive payment in accordance with the distribution and calculation scheme set forth in part 179 of this chapter.

          § 169.122   Who does the grantee pay if there is a life estate on the tract?

#### § § 169.122

          The grantee must pay compensation directly to the life tenant under the terms of the right-of-way unless the whereabouts of the life tenant are unknown, in which case we may collect compensation on behalf of the life tenant.

        Grants of Rights-of-Way

          § 169.123   What is the process for BIA to grant a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.123

          (a) Before we grant a right-of-way, we must determine that the right-of-way is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:

          (1) Review the right-of-way application and supporting documents;

          (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and adverse impacts, and ensure compliance with all applicable Federal environmental, land use, historic preservation, and cultural resource laws and ordinances; and

          (3) Require any modifications or mitigation measures necessary to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land use requirements.

          (b) Upon receiving a right-of-way application, we will promptly notify the applicant whether the package is complete. A complete package includes all of the information and supporting documents required under this subpart, including but not limited to, an accurate legal description for each affected tract, documentation of landowner consent, NEPA review documentation and valuation documentation, where applicable.

          (1) If the right-of-way application package is not complete, our letter will identify the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If we do not respond to the submission of an application package, the parties may take action under § 169.304.

          (2) If the right-of-way application package is complete, we will notify the applicant of the date of our receipt of the complete package. Within 60 days of our receipt of a complete package, we will grant or deny the right-of-way, return the package for revision, or inform the applicant in writing that we need additional review time. If we inform the applicant in writing that we need additional time, then:

          (i) Our letter informing the applicant that we need additional review time must identify our initial concerns and invite the applicant to respond within 15 days of the date of the letter; and

          (ii) We will issue a written determination granting or denying the right-of-way within 30 days from sending the letter informing the applicant that we need additional time.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadlines in this section, then the applicant may take appropriate action under § 169.304.

          (d) We will provide any right-of-way denial and the basis for the determination, along with notification of any appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter to the parties to the right-of-way. If the right-of-way is granted, we will provide a copy of the right-of-way to the tribal landowner and, upon written request, make copies available to the individual Indian landowners, and provide notice under § 169.12.

          § 169.124   How will BIA determine whether to grant a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.124

          Our decision to grant or deny a right-of-way will be in writing.

          (a) We will grant a right-of-way unless:

          (1) The requirements of this subpart have not been met, such as if the required landowner consent has not been obtained under § 169.107; or

          (2) We find a compelling reason to withhold the grant in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the right-of-way is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold our grant of a right-of-way.

          (d) We may grant one right-of-way for all of the tracts traversed by the right-of-way, or we may issue separate grants for one or more tracts traversed by the right-of-way.

          § 169.125   What will the grant of right-of-way contain?

#### § § 169.125

          (a) The grant will incorporate the conditions or restrictions set out in the Indian landowners' consents.

          (b) The grant will address:

          (1) The use(s) the grant is authorizing;

          (2) Whether assignment of the right-of-way is permitted and, if so, whether additional consent is required for the assignment and whether any additional compensation is owed to the landowners;

          (3) Whether mortgaging of the right-of-way is permitted and, if so, whether additional consent is required for the mortgage and whether any additional compensation is owed to the landowners; and

          (4) Ownership of permanent improvements under § 169.130.

          (c) The grant will state that:

          (1) The tribe maintains its existing jurisdiction over the land, activities, and persons within the right-of-way under § 169.10 and reserves the right of the tribe to reasonable access to the lands subject to the grant to determine grantee's compliance with consent conditions or to protect public health and safety;

          (2) The grantee has no right to any of the products or resources of the land, including but not limited to, timber, forage, mineral, and animal resources, unless otherwise provided for in the grant;

          (3) BIA may treat any provision of a grant that violates Federal law as a violation of the grant; and

          (4) If historic properties, archeological resources, human remains, or other cultural items not previously reported are encountered during the course of any activity associated with this grant, all activity in the immediate vicinity of the properties, resources, remains, or items will cease and the grantee will contact BIA and the tribe with jurisdiction over the land to determine how to proceed and appropriate disposition.

          (5) The grantee must:

          (i) Construct and maintain improvements within the right-of-way in a professional manner consistent with industry standards;

          (ii) Pay promptly all damages and compensation, in addition to bond or alternative form of security made pursuant to § 169.103, determined by the BIA to be due the landowners and authorized users and occupants of land as a result of the granting, construction, and maintenance of the right-of-way;

          (iii) Restore the land as nearly as may be possible to its original condition, upon the completion of construction, to the extent compatible with the purpose for which the right-of-way was granted, or reclaim the land if agreed to by the landowners;

          (iv) Clear and keep clear the land within the right-of-way, to the extent compatible with the purpose of the right-of-way, and dispose of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project;

          (v) Comply with all applicable laws and obtain all required permits;

          (vi) Not commit waste;

          (vii) Operate, repair and maintain improvements consistent with the right-of-way grant;

          (viii) Build and maintain necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect the improvements constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way;

          (ix) Restore the land to its original condition, to the maximum extent reasonably possible, upon cancellation or termination of the right-of-way, or reclaim the land if agreed to by the landowners;

          (x) At all times keep the BIA, and the tribe for tribal land, informed of the grantee's address;

          (xi) Refrain from interfering with the landowner's use of the land, provided that the landowner's use of the land is not inconsistent with the right-of-way;

          (xii) Comply with due diligence requirements under § 169.105; and

          (xiii) Notify the BIA, and the tribe for tribal land, if it files for bankruptcy or is placed in receivership.

          (6) Unless the grantee would be prohibited by law from doing so, the grantee must also:

          (i) Hold the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, liability, or damages resulting from the applicant's use or occupation of the premises; and

          (ii) Indemnify the United States and the Indian landowners against all liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or release or discharge of any hazardous material from the premises that occurs during the term of the grant, regardless of fault, with the exception that the applicant is not required to indemnify the Indian landowners for liability or cost arising from the Indian landowners' negligence or willful misconduct.

          (d) The grant must attach or include by reference maps of definite location.

          § 169.126   May a right-of-way contain a preference consistent with tribal law for employment of tribal members?

#### § § 169.126

          A grant of right-of-way over or across Indian land may include a provision, consistent with tribal law, requiring the grantee to give a preference to qualified tribal members, based on their political affiliation with the tribe.

          § 169.127   Is a new right-of-way grant required for a new use within or overlapping an existing right-of-way?

#### § § 169.127

          (a) If you are the grantee, you may use all or a portion of an existing right-of-way for a use not specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way only if it is within the same scope of the use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way.

          (1) If you propose to use all or a portion of an existing right-of-way for a use not specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way and not within the same scope of the use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way, and the new use will not require any ground disturbance, you must request an amendment to the existing right-of-way grant.

          (2) If you propose to use all or a portion of an existing right-of-way for a use not specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way and not within the same scope of the use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way, and the new use requires ground disturbance, you must request a new right-of-way.

          (b) If you are not the grantee:

          (1) You may use all or a portion of an existing right-of-way for a use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way or a use within the same scope of the use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way if the grantee obtains an assignment to authorize the new user; or

          (2) You may use all or a portion of an existing right-of-way for a use not specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way and not within the same scope of use specified in the original grant of the existing right-of-way if you request a new right-of-way within or overlapping the existing right-of-way for the new use.

          (c) An example of a use within the same scope is a right-of-way for underground telephone line being used for an underground fiber optic line, and an example of a use that is not within the same scope is a right-of-way for a pipeline being used for a road or railroad.

          § 169.128   When will BIA grant a right-of-way for a new use within or overlapping an existing right-of-way?

#### § § 169.128

          We may grant a new right-of-way within or overlapping an existing right-of-way if it meets the following conditions:

          (a) The applicant follows the procedures and requirements in this part to obtain a new right-of-way.

          (b) The new right-of-way does not interfere with the use or purpose of the existing right-of-way and the applicant has obtained the consent of the existing right-of-way grantee. The existing right-of-way grantee may not unreasonably withhold consent.

          § 169.129   What is required if the location described in the original application and grant differs from the construction location?

#### § § 169.129

          (a) If engineering or other complications prevented construction within the location identified in the original application and grant, and required a minor deviation from the location identified in the original application and grant, then we and the tribe, for tribal land, will determine whether the change in location requires one or more of the following:

          (1) An amended map of definite location;

          (2) Landowner consent;

          (3) A valuation or, with landowner consent, a recalculation of compensation;

          (4) Additional compensation or security; or

          (5) Other actions required to comply with applicable laws.

          (b) If BIA and the tribe, for tribal land, determine it is not a minor deviation in location, we may require a new right-of-way grant or amendment to the right-of-way grant.

          (c) If we grant a right-of-way for the new route or location, the applicant must execute instruments to extinguish, or amend, as appropriate, the right-of-way at the original location identified in the application.

          (d) We will transmit the instruments to extinguish or amend the right-of-way to the LTRO for recording.

          § 169.130   Must a right-of-way grant address ownership of permanent improvements?

#### § § 169.130

          (a) A right-of-way grant must specify who will own any permanent improvements the grantee constructs during the grant term and may specify under what conditions, if any, permanent improvements the grantee constructs may be conveyed to the Indian landowners during the grant term. In addition, the grant may indicate whether each specific permanent improvement the grantee constructs will:

          (1) Remain on the premises, upon the expiration, cancellation, or termination of the grant, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners, and become the property of the Indian landowners;

          (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the grant, at the grantee's expense, with the premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before construction of the permanent improvements; or

          (3) Be disposed of by other specified means.

          (b) A grant that requires the grantee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession of and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.

      Subpart D—Duration, Renewals, Amendments, Assignments, Mortgages

        Duration & Renewals

          § 169.201   How long may the duration of a right-of-way grant be?

#### § § 169.201

          (a) All rights-of-way granted under this part are limited to the time periods stated in the grant.

          (b) For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the right-of-way term is reasonable.

          (c) For individually owned Indian land, we will review the right-of-way duration to ensure that it is reasonable, given the purpose of the right-of-way. We will generally consider a maximum duration of 20 years to be reasonable for the initial term for rights-of-way for oil and gas purposes and a maximum of 50 years, inclusive of the initial term and any renewals, to be reasonable for rights-of-way for all other purposes. We will consider a duration consistent with use to be reasonable for rights-of-way for conservation easements. We will consider durations different from these guidelines if a different duration would benefit the Indian landowners, is required by another Federal agency, or the tribe has negotiated for a different duration and the right-of-way crosses tribal land.

          § 169.202   Under what circumstances will a grant of right-of-way be renewed?

#### § § 169.202

          A renewal is an extension of term of an existing right-of-way without any other change.

          (a) The grantee may request a renewal of an existing right-of-way grant and we will renew the grant as long as:

          (1) The initial term and renewal terms, together, do not exceed the maximum term determined to be reasonable under § 169.201;

          (2) The existing right-of-way grant explicitly allows for automatic renewal or an option to renew and specifies compensation owed to the landowners upon renewal or how compensation will be determined;

          (3) The grantee provides us with a signed affidavit that there is no change in size, type, or location, of the right-of-way;

          (4) The initial term has not yet ended;

          (5) No uncured violation exists regarding the regulations in this part or the grant's conditions or restrictions; and

          (6) The grantee provides confirmation that landowner consent has been obtained, or if consent is not required because the original right-of-way grant explicitly allows for renewal without the owners' consent, the grantee provides notice to the landowners of the renewal.

          (b) We will record any renewal of a right-of-way grant in the LTRO.

          (c) If the proposed renewal involves any change to the original grant or the original grant was silent as to renewals, the grantee must reapply for a new right-of-way, in accordance with § 169.101, and we will handle the application for renewal as an original application for a right-of-way.

          § 169.203   May a right-of-way be renewed multiple times?

#### § § 169.203

          There is no prohibition on renewing a right-of-way multiple times, unless the grant expressly prohibits multiple renewals, and subject to the duration limitations for individually owned land in § 169.201. The provisions of § 169.202 apply to each renewal.

        Amendments

          § 169.204   May a grantee amend a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.204

          (a) An amendment is required to change any provisions of a right-of-way grant. If the change is a material change to the grant, we may require application for a new right-of-way instead.

          (b) A grantee may request that we amend a right-of-way to make an administrative modification ( a modification that is clerical in nature, for example to correct the legal description) without meeting consent requirements, as long as the grantee provides landowners with written notice. For all other amendments, the grantee must meet the consent requirements in § 169.107 and obtain our approval.

          § 169.205   What is the approval process for an amendment of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.205

          (a) When we receive an amendment for our approval, we will notify the grantee of the date we receive it. We have 30 days from receipt of the executed amendment, proof of required consents, and required documentation (including but not limited to a corrected legal description, if any, and NEPA compliance) to approve or disapprove the amendment. Our determination whether to approve the amendment will be in writing and will state the basis for our approval or disapproval.

          (b) If we need additional time to review, our letter informing the parties that we need additional time for review must identify our initial concerns and invite the parties to respond within 15 days of the date of the letter. We have 30 days from sending the letter informing the parties that we need additional time to approve or disapprove the amendment.

          (c) If we do not meet the deadline in paragraph (a) of this section, or paragraph (b) of this section if applicable, the grantee or Indian landowners may take appropriate action under § 169.304.

          § 169.206   How will BIA decide whether to approve an amendment of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.206

          (a) We may disapprove a request for an amendment of a right-of-way only if at least one of the following is true:

          (1) The Indian landowners have not consented to the amendment under § 169.107 and we have not consented on their behalf under § 169.108;

          (2) The grantee's sureties for the bonds or alternative securities have not consented;

          (3) The grantee is in violation of the right-of-way grant;

          (4) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (5) We find a compelling reason to withhold approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the amendment is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of an amendment.

        Assignments

          § 169.207   May a grantee assign a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.207

          (a) A grantee may assign a right-of-way by:

          (1) Meeting the consent requirements in § 169.107, unless the grant expressly allows for assignments without further consent; and

          (2) Either obtaining our approval, or meeting the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (b) A grantee may assign a right-of-way without BIA approval only if:

          (1) The original right-of-way grant expressly allows for assignment without BIA approval; and

          (2) The assignee and grantee provide a copy of the assignment and supporting documentation to BIA for recording in the LTRO within 30 days of the assignment.

          (c) Assignments that are the result of a corporate merger, acquisition, or transfer by operation of law are excluded from these requirements, except for the requirement to provide a copy of the assignment and supporting documentation to BIA for recording in the LTRO within 30 days and to the tribe for tribal land.

          § 169.208   What is the approval process for an assignment of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.208

          (a) When we receive an assignment for our approval, we will notify the grantee of the date we receive it. If our approval is required, we have 30 days from receipt of the executed assignment, proof of any required consents, and any required documentation to approve or disapprove the assignment. Our determination whether to approve the assignment will be in writing and will state the basis for our approval or disapproval.

          (b) If we do not meet the deadline in this section, the grantee or Indian landowners may take appropriate action under § 169.304.

          § 169.209   How will BIA decide whether to approve an assignment of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.209

          (a) We may disapprove an assignment of a right-of-way only if at least one of the following is true:

          (1) The Indian landowners have not consented to the assignment under § 169.107 and their consent is required;

          (2) Sufficient bonding and/or insurance are not in place;

          (3) The grantee is in violation of the right-of-way grant;

          (4) The assignee does not agree to be bound by the terms of the right-of-way grant;

          (5) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (6) We find a compelling reason to withhold approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the assignment is in their best interest.

          (c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of an assignment.

        Mortgages

          § 169.210   May a grantee mortgage a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.210

          A grantee may mortgage a right-of-way, if the grant expressly allows mortgaging. The grantee must meet the consent requirements in § 169.107, unless the grant expressly allows for mortgaging without consent, and must obtain our approval for the mortgage.

          § 169.211   What is the approval process for a mortgage of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.211

          (a) When we receive a right-of-way mortgage for our approval, we will notify the grantee of the date we receive it. We have 30 days from receipt of the executed mortgage, proof of required consents, and required documentation to approve or disapprove the mortgage. Our determination whether to approve the mortgage will be in writing and will state the basis for our approval or disapproval.

          (b) If we do not meet the deadline in this section, the grantee or Indian landowners may take appropriate action under § 169.304.

          § 169.212   How will BIA decide whether to approve a mortgage of a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.212

          (a) We may disapprove a right-of-way mortgage only if at least one of the following is true:

          (1) The Indian landowners have not consented;

          (2) The grantee's sureties for the bonds have not consented;

          (3) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

          (4) We find a compelling reason to withhold approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

          (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, we may consider whether:

          (1) The mortgage proceeds would be used for purposes unrelated to the right-of-way purpose; and

          (2) The mortgage is limited to the right-of-way.

          (c) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the mortgage is in their best interest.

          (d) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a right-of-way mortgage.

      Subpart E—Effectiveness

        § 169.301   When will a right-of-way document be effective?

#### § § 169.301

        (a) A right-of-way document will be effective on the date we approve the right-of-way document, even if an appeal is filed under part 2 of this chapter.

        (b) The right-of-way document may specify a date on which the grantee's obligations are triggered. Such date may be before or after the approval date under paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 169.302   Must a right-of-way be recorded?

        (b) The tribe must record right-of-way documents for the following types of rights-of-way in the LTRO with jurisdiction over the affected Indian lands, even though BIA approval is not required:

        (1) Grants on tribal land for a tribal utility under § 169.4;

        (2) Grants on tribal land under a special act of Congress authorizing grants without our approval under certain conditions.

        § 169.303   What happens if BIA denies a right-of-way document?

#### § § 169.303

        If we deny the right-of-way grant, renewal, amendment, assignment, or mortgage, we will notify the parties immediately and advise the landowners and the applicant of their right to appeal the decision under part 2 of this chapter.

        § 169.304   What happens if BIA does not meet a deadline for issuing a decision on a right-of-way document?

#### § § 169.304

        (a) If a Superintendent does not meet a deadline for granting or denying a right-of-way, renewal, amendment, assignment, or mortgage, the parties may file a written notice to compel action with the appropriate Regional Director.

        (b) The Regional Director has 15 days from receiving the notice to:

        (1) Grant or deny the right-of-way; or

        (2) Order the Superintendent to grant or deny the right-of-way within the time set out in the order.

        (c) Either party may file a written notice to compel action with the BIA Director if:

        (1) The Regional Director does not meet the deadline in paragraph (b) of this section;

        (2) The Superintendent does not grant or deny the right-of-way within the time set by the Regional Director under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

#### § § 169.305

        (a) If a party appeals our decision on a right-of-way document, then the official to whom the appeal is made may require the appellant to post an appeal bond in accordance with part 2 of this chapter. We will not require an appeal bond if the tribe is a party to the appeal and requests a waiver of the appeal bond.

        (b) The appellant may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The appellant may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

      Subpart F—Compliance and Enforcement

        § 169.401   What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?

#### § § 169.401

        This subpart describes the procedures we use to address compliance and enforcement related to rights-of-way on Indian land. Any abandonment, non-use, or violation of the right-of-way grant or right-of-way document, including but not limited to encroachments beyond the defined boundaries, accidental, willful, and/or incidental trespass, unauthorized new construction, changes in use not permitted in the grant, and late or insufficient payment may result in enforcement actions including, but not limited to, cancellation of the grant.

        § 169.402   Who may investigate compliance with a right-of-way?

#### § § 169.402

        (a) BIA may investigate compliance with a right-of-way.

        (1) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific abandonment, non-use, or violation has occurred, we will promptly initiate an appropriate investigation.

        (2) We may enter the Indian land subject to a right-of-way at any reasonable time, upon reasonable notice, and consistent with any notice requirements under applicable tribal law and applicable grant documents, to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and to determine if the grantee is in compliance with the requirements of the right-of-way.

        (b) The tribe with jurisdiction may investigate compliance consistent with tribal law.

        § 169.403   May a right-of-way provide for negotiated remedies?

#### § § 169.403

        (a) The tribe and the grantee on tribal land may negotiate remedies for a violation, abandonment, or non-use. The negotiated remedies must be stated in the tribe's consent to the right-of-way grant, which BIA will then incorporate into the grant itself. The negotiated remedies may include, but are not limited to, the power to terminate the right-of-way grant. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:

        (1) BIA approval of the termination is not required;

        (2) The termination is effective without BIA cancellation; and

        (3) The tribe must provide us with written notice of the termination so that we may record it in the LTRO.

        (b) The Indian landowners and the grantee to a right-of-way grant on individually owned Indian land may negotiate remedies, so long as the consent also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners of the majority interest under § 169.107. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:

        (1) BIA concurrence with the termination is required to ensure that the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests have consented; and

        (2) BIA will record the termination in the LTRO.

        (c) The parties must notify any surety of any violation that may result in termination and the termination of a right-of-way.

        (d) Negotiated remedies may apply in addition to, or instead of, the cancellation remedy available to us, as specified in the right-of-way grant. The landowners may request our assistance in enforcing negotiated remedies.

        (e) A right-of-way grant may provide that violations will be addressed by a tribe, and that disputes will be resolved by a tribal court, any other court of competent jurisdiction, or by a tribal governing body in the absence of a tribal court, or through an alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing actions or proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us.

        § 169.404   What will BIA do about a violation of a right-of-way grant?

#### § § 169.404

        (a) In the absence of actions or proceedings described in § 169.403 (negotiated remedies), or if it is not appropriate for us to defer to the actions or proceedings, we will follow the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. We will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communicate with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether a violation has occurred.

        (b) If we determine there has been a violation of the conditions of a grant, other than a violation of payment provisions covered by paragraph (c) of this section, we will promptly send the grantee a written notice of violation.

        (1) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

        (2) The notice of violation will advise the grantee that, within 10 business days of the receipt of a notice of violation, the grantee must:

        (i) Cure the violation and notify us, and the tribe for tribal land, in writing that the violation has been cured;

        (ii) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred; or

        (iii) Request additional time to cure the violation.

        (3) The notice of violation may order the grantee to cease operations under the right-of-way grant.

#### § § 169.405

        (a) If the grantee does not cure a violation of a right-of-way grant within the required time period, or provide adequate proof of payment as required in the notice of violation, we will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communicate with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether:

        (1) We should cancel the grant;

        (2) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the grant;

        (3) We should invoke other remedies available under the grant or applicable law, including collection on any available bond or, for failure to pay compensation, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or

        (4) The grantee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

        (b) Following consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communication with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, we may take action to recover unpaid compensation and any associated late payment charges.

        (1) We need not cancel the grant or give any further notice to the grantee before taking action to recover unpaid compensation.

        (2) We may take action to recover any unpaid compensation even though we cancel the grant.

        (c) If we decide to cancel the grant, we will send the grantee a cancellation letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 5 business days of our decision. We will send a copy of the cancellation letter to the tribe for tribal land, and will provide Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land with actual notice of the cancellation. The cancellation letter will:

        (5) Order the grantee to take any other action BIA deems necessary to protect the Indian land.

        (d) We may invoke any other remedies available to us under the grant, including collecting on any available bond, and the Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under tribal law.

        § 169.407   How will payment rights relating to a right-of-way grant be allocated?

#### § § 169.407

        The right-of-way grant may allocate rights to payment for any proceeds, trespass damages, condemnation awards, settlement funds, and other payments between the Indian landowners and the grantee. If not specified in the grant, applicable policy, order, award, judgment, or other document, the Indian landowners will be entitled to receive these payments.

#### § § 169.408

        (a) We may cancel, in whole or in part, any rights-of-way granted under this part 30 days after mailing written notice to the grantee at its latest address, for a nonuse of the right-of-way for a consecutive 2-year period for the purpose for which it was granted. If the grantee fails to correct the basis for cancellation by the 30th day after we mailed the notice, we will issue an appropriate instrument cancelling the right-of-way and transmit it to the LTRO pursuant to part 150 of this chapter for recording and filing.

        (b) We may cancel, in whole or in part, any rights-of-way granted under this part immediately upon abandonment of the right-of-way by the grantee. We will issue an appropriate instrument cancelling the right-of-way and transmit it to the LTRO pursuant to part 150 of this chapter for recording and filing.

        (c) The cancellation notice will notify the grantee of the grantee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, including the possibility of that the official to whom the appeal is made will require the grantee to post an appeal bond.

        § 169.409   When will a cancellation of a right-of-way grant be effective?

#### § § 169.409

        (a) A cancellation involving a right-of-way grant will not be effective until 31 days after the grantee receives a cancellation letter from us, or 41 days from the date we mailed the letter, whichever is earlier.

        (b) The cancellation decision will not be effective if an appeal is filed unless the cancellation is made immediately effective under part 2 of this chapter. When a cancellation decision is not immediately effective, the grantee must continue to pay compensation and comply with the other terms of the grant.

        § 169.410   What will BIA do if a grantee remains in possession after a right-of-way expires or is terminated or cancelled?

#### § § 169.410

        If a grantee remains in possession after the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a right-of-way, and is not accessing the land to perform reclamation or other remaining grant obligations, we may treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass under applicable law and will communicate with the Indian landowners in making the determination whether to treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass. Unless the parties have notified us in writing that they are engaged in good faith negotiations to renew or obtain a new right-of-way, we may take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, such as a forcible entry and detainer action. The holdover time will be charged against the new term.

        § 169.413   What if an individual or entity takes possession of or uses Indian land or BIA land without a right-of-way or other proper authorization?

#### § § 169.413

        If an individual or entity takes possession of, or uses, Indian land or BIA land without a right-of-way and a right-of-way is required, the unauthorized possession or use is a trespass. An unauthorized use within an existing right-of-way is also a trespass. We may take action to recover possession, including eviction, on behalf of the Indian landowners and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law. The Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under applicable law, including applicable tribal law.

        § 169.414   May BIA take emergency action if Indian land is threatened?

#### § § 169.414

        (a) We may take appropriate emergency action if there is a natural disaster or if an individual or entity causes or threatens to cause immediate and significant harm to Indian land or BIA land. Emergency action may include judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm.

        (b) We will make reasonable efforts to notify the individual Indian landowners before and after taking emergency action on Indian land. In all cases, we will notify the Indian landowners after taking emergency action on Indian land. We will provide written notification of our action to the Indian tribe exercising jurisdiction over the Indian land before and after taking emergency action on Indian land.

        § 169.415   How will BIA conduct compliance and enforcement when there is a life estate on the tract?

#### § § 169.415

        (a) We may monitor the use of the land, as appropriate, and will enforce the terms of the right-of-way on behalf of the owners of the remainder interests, but will not be responsible for enforcing the right-of-way on behalf of the life tenant.

        (b) The life tenant may not cause or allow permanent injury to the land.

**Authority:** Authority: Pub. L. 112-141, Pub. L. 114-94; 5 U.S.C. 2; 23 U.S.C. 201, 202; 25 U.S.C. 2, 9.

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 78463, Nov. 7, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Policies, Applicability, and Definitions

        § 170.1   What does this part do?

#### § § 170.1

        This part provides rules and references to the statutory funding formula for the Department of the Interior (DOI), in cooperation with the Department of Transportation (DOT), to implement the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP). Included in this part are references to other title 23 and title 25 transportation programs administered by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and the Secretary of Transportation (together, the “Secretaries”) and implemented by Tribes and Consortiums in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, FHWA program agreements, and other appropriate agreements.

        § 170.2   What policies govern the TTP?

#### § § 170.2

        (a) The Secretaries' policy for the TTP is to:

        (1) Provide a uniform and consistent set of rules;

        (2) Foster knowledge of the programs by providing information about them and the opportunities that they create;

        (3) Facilitate Tribal planning, conduct, and administration of the programs;

        (4) Encourage inclusion of these programs under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements;

        (5) Make available all contractible non-inherently Federal administrative functions under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements; and

        (6) Carry out policies, procedures, and practices in consultation with Indian Tribes to ensure the letter, spirit, and goals of Federal transportation programs are fully implemented.

        (b) Where this part differs from provisions in the ISDEAA, this part should advance the policy of increasing Tribal autonomy and discretion in program operation.

        (c) This part is designed to enable Indian Tribes to participate in all contractible activities of the TTP. The Secretaries will afford Indian Tribes the flexibility, information, and discretion to design transportation programs under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements to meet the needs of their communities consistent with this part.

        (d) Programs, functions, services, and activities, regardless of how they are administered, are an exercise of Indian Tribes' self-determination and self-governance.

        (1) The Tribe is responsible for managing the day-to-day operation of its contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities.

        (2) The Tribe accepts responsibility and accountability to the beneficiaries under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements for:

        (i) Use of the funds; and

        (ii) Satisfactory performance of all activities funded under the contract or agreement.

        (3) The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of Tribes and the trust resources of individual Indians.

        (e) The Secretary should interpret Federal laws and regulations to facilitate including programs covered by this part in the government-to-government agreements authorized under ISDEAA.

        (f) The administrative functions referenced in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are contractible without regard to the organizational level within the DOI that carries out these functions. Including TTP administrative functions under self-determination contracts, self- governance agreements, program agreements or other appropriate agreements, does not limit or reduce the funding for any program or service serving any other Tribe.

        (g) The Secretaries are not required to reduce funding for a Tribe under these programs to make funds available to another Tribe.

        (h) This part must be liberally construed for the benefit of Tribes and to implement the Federal policy of self-determination and self-governance.

        (i) Any ambiguities in this part must be construed in favor of the Tribes to facilitate and enable the transfer of programs authorized by 23 U.S.C. 201 and 202 and title 25 of the U.S.C.

        § 170.3   When do other requirements apply to the TTP?

#### § § 170.3

        TTP policies, guidance, and directives apply, to the extent permitted by law, only if they are consistent with this part and 25 CFR parts 900 and 1000. See 25 CFR 900.5 for when a Tribe must comply with other unpublished requirements.

        § 170.4   How does this part affect existing Tribal rights?

        (b) The Tribal supplemental program funds will be distributed as follows:

        (1) Initially, the Tribal supplemental program funding determined in paragraph (a) of this section will be designated among the BIA Regions in proportion to the regional total of Tribal shares based on the cumulative Tribal shares of all Indian Tribes within the region under § 170.201.

        (2) After paragraph (b)(1) of this section is completed, the Tribal supplemental program funding designated for each region will be distributed among the Tribes within the region as follows:

        (i) The Secretaries will determine which Tribes would be entitled under § 170.200 to receive in a fiscal year less funding than they would receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C (in effect as of July 5, 2012); and

        (ii) The combined amount that such Indian Tribes would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to such relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor in excess of the amount that they would be entitled to receive in the fiscal year under § 170.200.

        (c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretaries will distribute a combined amount to each Tribe that meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section a share of funding in proportion to the share of the combined amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section attributable to such Indian Tribe.

        (d) A Tribe may not receive under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and based on its Tribal share under § 170.200 a combined amount that exceeds the amount that such Indian Tribe would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C.

        (e) If the amount made available for a region under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds the amount distributed among Indian Tribes within that region under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, The Secretaries will distribute the remainder of such region's funding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section among all Tribes in that region in proportion to the combined amount that each such Tribe received under § 170.200 and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

          § 170.404   Can Tribes use transportation planning funds for other activities?

#### § § 170.404

          Yes. After completion of a Tribe's annual planning activities, unexpended planning funds made available under 23 U.S.C. 202(c) may be used on eligible projects or activities provided that they are identified on a FHWA-approved TTPTIP.

          § 170.405   How must Tribes use planning funds?

#### § § 170.405

          TTP funds as defined in 23 U.S.C. 202(c) are available to a Tribal government to support Tribal transportation planning and associated activities, including:

          (a) Attending transportation planning meetings;

          (b) Pursuing other sources of funds; and

          (c) Developing the Tribal priority list, TTIP, LRTP, or any of the transportation planning functions and activities listed in § 170.402.

          §§ 170.406-170.408   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 170.406-170.408

          § 170.409   What is the purpose of long-range transportation planning?

#### § § 170.409

          (a) The purpose of long-range transportation planning is to clearly demonstrate a Tribe's transportation needs and to develop strategies to meet these needs. These strategies should address future land use, economic development, traffic demand, public safety, and health and social needs. The planning process should result in a LRTP.

          (b) The time horizon for a LRTP should be 20 years to match State transportation planning horizons.

          § 170.410   How does a long-range transportation plan relate to the NTTFI?

#### § § 170.410

          A LRTP is developed using a uniform process that identifies the transportation needs and priorities of a Tribe. The NTTFI (see § 170.442) is derived from transportation facilities identified through an LRTP. It is also a means for identifying projects and activities for the TTP.

          § 170.411   What should a long-range transportation plan include?

#### § § 170.411

          A LRTP should include:

          (a) An evaluation of a full range of transportation modes and connections between modes such as highway, rail, air, and water, to meet transportation needs;

          (b) Trip generation studies, including determination of traffic generators due to land use;

          (c) Social and economic development planning to identify transportation improvements or needs to accommodate existing and proposed land use in a safe and economical fashion;

          (d) Measures that address health and safety concerns relating to transportation improvements;

          (e) A review of the existing and proposed transportation system to identify the relationships between transportation and the environment;

          (f) Cultural preservation planning to identify important issues and develop a transportation plan that is sensitive to Tribal cultural preservation;

          (g) Scenic byway and tourism plans;

          (h) Measures that address energy conservation considerations;

          (i) A prioritized list of short- and long-term transportation needs; and

          (j) An analysis of funding alternatives to implement plan recommendations.

          § 170.412   How is the Tribal TTP long-range transportation plan developed and approved?

#### § § 170.412

          (a) The Tribal TTP long-range transportation plan is developed by either:

          (1) A Tribe working through a self-determination contract, self-governance agreement, Program Agreement; and other appropriate agreement; or

          (2) BIA or FHWA upon request of, and in consultation with, a Tribe. The Tribe and BIA or FHWA need to agree on the methodology and elements included in development of the TTP long-range transportation plan along with time frames before work begins. The development of a long-range transportation plan on behalf of a Tribe will be funded from the Tribe's share of the TTP funds.

          (b) During the development of the TTP long-range transportation plan, the Tribe and BIA or FHWA will jointly conduct a midpoint review.

          (c) The public reviews a draft TTP long-range transportation plan as required by § 170.413. The plan is further refined to address any issues identified during the public review process. The Tribe then approves the TTP long-range transportation plan.

          § 170.413   What is the public's role in developing the long-range transportation plan?

#### § § 170.413

          BIA, FHWA, or the Tribe must solicit public involvement. If there are no Tribal policies regarding public involvement, a Tribe must use the procedures in this section. Public involvement begins at the same time long-range transportation planning begins and covers the range of users, from stakeholders and private citizens to major public and private entities. Public involvement must include either meetings or notices, or both.

          (a) For public meetings, BIA, FHWA or the Tribe must:

          (1) Advertise each public meeting in local and Tribal public newspapers at least 15 days before the meeting date. In the absence of local and Tribal public newspapers, BIA, FHWA, or the Tribe may post notices under locally acceptable practices;

          (2) Provide at the meeting copies of the draft LRTP;

          (3) Provide information on funding and the planning process; and

          (4) Provide the public the opportunity to comment, either orally or in writing.

          (b) For public notices, BIA, FHWA, or the Tribe must:

          (1) Publish a notice in the local and Tribal public newspapers when the draft LRTP is complete. In the absence of local and Tribal public newspapers, BIA, FHWA, or the Tribe may post notices under locally acceptable practices; and

          (2) State in the notice that the LRTP is available for review, where a copy can be obtained, whom to contact for questions, where comments may be submitted, and the deadline for submitting comments (normally 30 days).

          § 170.414   How is the Tribal long-range transportation plan used and updated?

#### § § 170.414

          The Tribal government uses its TTP long-range transportation plan to develop transportation projects as documented in a Tribal priority list or TTIP and to identify and justify the Tribe's updates to the NTTFI. To be consistent with State, Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and Regional Planning Organization (RPO) planning practices, the TTP long-range transportation plan must be reviewed annually and updated at least every five years.

          § 170.415   What are pre-project planning and project identification studies?

#### § § 170.415

          (a) Pre-project planning and project identification studies are part of overall transportation planning and include the activities conducted before final project approval on the TTPTIP. These processes provide the information necessary to financially constrain and program a project on the four-year TTPTIP but are not the final determination that projects will be designed and built. These activities include:

          (1) Preliminary project cost estimates;

          (2) Certification of public involvement;

          (3) Consultation and coordination with States and/or MPO's for regionally significant projects;

          (4) Preliminary needs assessments; and

          (5) Preliminary environmental and archeological reviews.

          (b) BIA and/or FHWA, upon request of the Tribe, will work cooperatively with Tribal, State, regional, and metropolitan transportation planning organizations concerning the leveraging of funds from non-TTP sources and identification of other funding sources to expedite the planning, design, and construction of projects on the TTPTIP.

          § 170.420   What is the Tribal priority list?

#### § § 170.420

          The Tribal priority list is a list of all transportation projects that the Tribe wants funded. The list:

          (a) Is not financially constrained; and

          (b) Is provided to BIA or FHWA by official Tribal action, unless the Tribal government submits a TTIP.

        Tribal Transportation Improvement Programs

          § 170.421   What is the Tribal Transportation Improvement Program (TTIP)?

#### § § 170.421

          (a) The TTIP:

          (1) Is developed from and must be consistent with the Tribe's Tribal priority list or LRTP;

          (2) Is financially constrained for all identified funding sources;

          (3) Must identify (year by year) all TTP funded projects and activities that are expected to be carried out over the next four years as well as the projected costs and all other funding sources that are expected to be used on those projects. Although 23 U.S.C. 134(j)(1)(D) indicates a TIP must be updated once every four years, Tribes are encouraged to update the TTIP annually to best represent the plans of the Tribe;

          (4) Must identify all projects and activities that are funded through other Federal, State, county, and municipal transportation funds and are carried out by the Tribe in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 202(a)(9);

          (5) Must include public involvement;

          (6) Is reviewed and updated as necessary by the Tribal government;

          (7) Can be changed only by the Tribal government; and

          (8) After approval by the Tribal government, must be forwarded to BIA or FHWA by Tribal resolution or authorized governmental action certifying public involvement has occurred and requesting approval.

          (b) A copy of the FHWA-approved TTIP is returned to the Tribe and BIA. Although the FHWA-approved TTIP authorizes the Tribe to expend TTP funds for the projects and/or activities shown, it does not waive or modify other Federal, local, or financial statutory or regulatory requirements associated with the projects or activities.

          § 170.422   How does the public participate in developing the TTIP?

#### § § 170.422

          Public involvement is required in the development of the TTIP.

          (a) The Tribe must publish a notice in local and/or Tribal newspapers when the draft TTIP is complete. In the absence of local public newspapers, the Tribe or BIA may post notices under locally acceptable practices. The notice must indicate where a copy can be obtained, a contact person for questions, where comments may be submitted, and the deadline for submitting comments. A copy of the notice will be made available to BIA or FHWA upon request.

          (b) The Tribe may hold public meetings at which the public may comment orally or in writing.

          (c) The Tribe, the State transportation department, or MPO may conduct public involvement activities.

          § 170.423   How are annual updates or amendments to the TTIP conducted?

#### § § 170.423

          (a) The TTIP annual update allows:

          (1) Changes to schedules and funding amounts for identified projects and activities; and

          (2) The addition of transportation projects and activities planned for the next four years.

          (b) During the first quarter of a fiscal year, Tribes will be notified of the opportunity to update their TTIP. This notification will contain information on where the Tribes can access their estimated TTP funding amounts for that fiscal year, and will include a copy of their previously approved TTIP, as well as instructions for submitting the annual update.

          (c) The Tribe must then review any new transportation planning information and priority lists, update their TTIP using the procedures in § 170.421, and forward the documentation to their respective BIA Regional Office or to FHWA.

          (d) If forwarded to:

          (1) A BIA Regional Office—The Office will review all submitted information with the Tribe and provide a written response (concurring, denying, or requesting additional information) within 45 days. If the BIA regional office concurs in the TTIP, it is then forwarded to FHWA for final approval.

          (2) FHWA-FHWA will review all submitted information with the Tribe and provide a written response (approving, denying, or requesting additional information) within 45 days. Once a proposed TTIP update is approved by FHWA, it will be included in that year's overall TTPTIP.

          (e) The Tribe may amend their approved TTIP at any time using the procedures in § 170.421 and paragraph (d) of this section in order to add a new project or activity within the current fiscal year that they intend to expend TTP funds on.

          § 170.424   What is the TTP Transportation Improvement Program (TTPTIP)?

#### § § 170.424

          (a) Each year, FHWA will compile the approved TTIPs for all of the Tribes into one document called the TTPTIP. This document will identify all expected projects and activities over a four-year period and will be organized by fiscal year, State, and Tribe.

          (b) FHWA and BIA will post the approved TTPTIP on their respective Web sites. A subset of the TTPTIP that identifies only design and construction activities will annually be provided to the pertinent FHWA Division office for further transmittal to each State Transportation Office/Department for inclusion in the STIP without further action per 23 U.S.C. 201(c)(4).

        Public Hearings

          § 170.435   When is a public hearing required?

#### § § 170.435

          The Tribe, or BIA or FHWA after consultation with the appropriate Tribe and other involved agencies, determines whether or not a public hearing is needed for a TTPTIP, a LRTP, or a project. A public hearing must be held if a project:

          (a) Is for the construction of a new route or facility;

          (b) Would significantly change the layout or function of connecting or related roads or streets;

          (c) Would cause a substantial adverse effect on adjacent property; or

      Subpart B—How To Acquire Leases

        § 211.20   Leasing procedures.

#### § § 211.20

        (a) Indian mineral owners may, with the approval of the superintendent or area director, lease their land for mining purposes. No oil and gas lease shall be approved unless it has first been offered for bidding at an advertised lease sale in accordance with this section. Leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section unless the Secretary grants the Indian mineral owners written permission to negotiate for lease. Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over the lands.

        (b) Indian mineral owners may request that the Secretary prepare and advertise or negotiate (if the requirements of this section have been met) mineral leases on their behalf. If requested by an applicant interested in acquiring rights to Indian-owned minerals, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Indian mineral owner, and advise the owner in writing of the alternatives available, including the right to decline to lease. If the Indian mineral owner decides to have the leases advertised, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner concerning the appropriate royalty rate and rental. The Secretary may then undertake the responsibility to advertise and lease in accordance with the following procedures:

        (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements of lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate superintendent or area director for future reference.

        (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to the responsible bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary, after consultation with the Indian mineral owner, shall establish the rental and royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and shall not be subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that acceptance of the lease bid by the Indian mineral owner is required.

        (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that bid is not accepted.

        (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.

        (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall also file the lease in completed form at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.

        (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete all requirements necessary for the approval of the lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-advertise the lease for sale, or, subject to the consent of the Indian mineral owner, the lease may be let through private negotiations.

        (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained.

        (d) The Indian mineral owner may also submit negotiated leases to the Secretary for review and approval.

#### § § 211.26

        § 211.27   Duration of leases.

#### § § 211.27

        (a) All leases shall be for a term not to exceed a primary term of lease duration of ten (10) years and, absent specific lease provisions to the contrary, shall continue as long thereafter as the minerals specified in the lease are produced in paying quantities. Absent specific lease provisions to the contrary, all provisions in leases governing their duration shall be measured from the date of approval by the Secretary.

        (b) An oil and gas or geothermal resource lease which stipulates that it shall continue in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of lease duration (“commencement clause”) if drilling operations have commenced during the primary term, shall be valid and shall hold the lease beyond the primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee has commenced actual drilling by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease with a drilling rig designed to reach the total proposed depth, and drilling is continued with reasonable diligence until the well is completed to production or abandoned. However, in no case shall such drilling hold the lease longer than 120 days past the primary term of lease duration without actual production of oil, gas, or geothermal resources.  that this extension does not allow a lease to continue past the 10-year statutory limitation. Drilling which meets the requirements of this section and occurs within a unit or communitization agreement to which the lease is committed shall be considered as if it occurs on the leasehold itself. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will control.

        (c) A solid minerals lease which stipulates that it shall continue in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of lease duration if mining operations have commenced during the primary term (commencement clause), shall be valid and hold the lease beyond the primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee has by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease commenced actual removal of mineral materials intended for sale and upon which royalties will be paid. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will control.

For the purposes of this section, a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of agreements that allocate costs and benefits.

        (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is specifically required in the lease. However, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner prior to making a determination concerning a cooperative agreement or well spacing plan.

        (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be filed with the superintendent or area director.

        (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice requirement.

        (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.

        (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved before the lease expiration date.

        (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be effective on the date the agreement is effective.

        (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program approved by the authorized officer.

        (c) If a lease has been recorded, the lessee must submit a release along with the recording information of the original lease so that, after acceptance of the release, it may be recorded;

        (d) If a lessee requests to surrender an entire lease or an entire undivided portion of a lease document, the lessee must deliver to the superintendent or area director the original lease documents;  that where the request is made by an assignee to whom no copy of the lease was delivered, the assignee must deliver to the superintendent or area director only its copy of the assignment;

        (e) If the lease (or a portion thereof being surrendered) is owned in undivided interests, all lessees owning undivided interests in the lease must join in the request for surrender;

        (f) No part of any advance rental shall be refunded to the lessee, nor shall any subsequent surrender or termination of a lease relieve the lessee of the obligation to pay advance rental if advance rental became due prior to the date the request for surrender was received by the superintendent or area director;

        (g) If oil, gas, or geothermal resources are being drained from the leased premises by a well or wells located on lands not included in the lease, the Secretary reserves the right, prior to acceptance of the surrender, to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to protect the interests of the Indian mineral owners of the lands surrendered.

        § 211.52   Fees.

#### § § 211.52

        Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each permit, lease, sublease, or other contract, or assignment, thereof shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $75.00 at the time of filing.

        § 211.53   Assignments, overriding royalties, and operating agreements.

#### § § 211.53

        (a) Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Secretary. The Indian mineral owner must also consent if approval of the Indian mineral owner is required in the lease. If consent is not required, then the Secretary shall notify the Indian mineral owner of the proposed assignment. To obtain the approval of the Secretary the assignee must be qualified to hold the lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease.

        (b) No lease or interest therein or the use of such lease shall be assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary.

        (c) Assignments of leases, and stipulations modifying the provisions of existing leases, which stipulations are also subject to the approval of the Secretary, shall be filed with the superintendent within five (5) working days after the date of execution. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds by the assignee the Secretary may permit the release of any bonds executed by the assignor. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds the assignee accepts all the assignor's responsibilities and prior obligations and liabilities of the assignor (including but not limited to any underpaid royalties and rentals) under the lease.

        (d) Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production shall not be considered as interests in the leases as such provision is used in this section. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating operators are hereby authorized and the approval of the Secretary shall not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be subject to the condition that nothing in such agreements shall be construed as modifying any of the obligations of the lessee, including, but not limited to, obligations imposed by requirements of the MMS for reporting, accounting, and auditing; obligations for diligent development and operation, protection against drainage and mining in trespass, compliance with oil and gas, geothermal, and mining regulations (25 CFR part 216; 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, and 3590; and those applicable rules found in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C) and the requirements for Secretarial approval before abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. All such obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free of any such overriding royalties or payments. The existence of agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered as justification for the approval of abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. Nothing in this paragraph revokes the requirement for approval of assignments and other instruments which is required in this section, but any overriding royalties or payments out of production created by the provisions of such assignments or instruments shall be subject to the condition stated in this section. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating operators shall be filed with the superintendent unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant to this section.

        § 211.54   Lease or permit cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.

#### § § 211.54

        (b) The notice of noncompliance or proposed cancellation shall specify in what respect the permittee or lessee has failed to comply with the requirements referenced in paragraph (a), and shall specify what actions, if any, must be taken to correct the noncompliance.

        (c) The notice shall be served upon the permittee or lessee by delivery in person or by certified mail to the permittee or lessee at the permittee's or lessee's last known address. When certified mail is used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when the notice is received or five (5) working days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.

        (d) The lessee or permittee shall have thirty (30) days (or such longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is served to respond, in writing, to the official or the Bureau of Indian Affairs office that issued the notice.

        (e) If a permittee or lessee fails to take any action that is prescribed in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a timely written response to the notice, or files a written response that does not, in the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the permittee's or lessee's actions, then the Secretary may cancel the lease or permit, specifying the basis for the cancellation.

        (f) If a permittee or lessee fails to take corrective action or to file a timely written response adequately justifying the permittee's or lessee's actions pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary may issue an order of cessation of operations. If the permittee or lessee fails to comply with the order of cessation, or fails to timely file an appeal of the order of cessation pursuant to paragraph (h), the Secretary may issue an order of lease or permit cancellation.

        (g) Cancellation of a lease or permit shall not relieve the lessee or permittee of any continuing obligations under the lease or permit.

        (h) Orders of cessation or of lease or permit cancellation issued pursuant to this section may be appealed under 25 CFR part 2.

        (i) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian mineral owner as set forth in the lease or permit.

        (j) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of the authorized officer or the MMS official to take any enforcement action authorized pursuant to statute or regulation.

        (k) The authorized officer, MMS official, and the superintendent and/or area director should consult with one another before taking any enforcement actions.

        § 211.55   Penalties.

#### § § 211.55

        (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under § 211.54, violations of the terms and conditions of any lease, or the regulations in this part, or failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a cessation order issued by the Secretary, or, in the case of solid minerals the authorized officer, may subject a lessee or permittee to a penalty of not more than $1,943 per day for each day that such a violation or noncompliance continues beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action.

        (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the lessee or permittee either personally or by certified mail to the lessee or permittee at the lessee's or permittee's last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date when received or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.

        (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the lessee or permittee of the lessee's or permittee's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be held before the superintendent and/or area director whose findings shall be conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.

        (d) If the lessee or permittee served with a notice of proposed penalty requests a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a written suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a suspension will not be detrimental to the lessor and upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.

        (e) Payment in full of penalties more than ten (10) days after a final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the lessee or permittee to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific lease provision prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments shall be a rate applicable under § 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is late.

        (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:

        (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the authorized officer, the director's representative or the MMS official to impose penalties for violations of applicable regulations pursuant to 43 CFR part 3160, and 43 CFR Groups 3400 and 3500, 30 CFR part 750, or 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C;

        (2) Replacing or superseding any penalty provision in the terms and conditions of a lease or permit approved by the Secretary pursuant to this part; or

        (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of lease or permit terms for which the authorized officer, director's representative or MMS official, have either statutory or regulatory authority to assess a penalty.

      Subpart B—How To Acquire Leases

        § 212.20   Leasing procedures.

#### § § 212.20

        (a) Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over the lands.

        (b) Indian mineral owners may request the Secretary to prepare, advertise and negotiate mineral leases on their behalf. Leases for minerals shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section unless one or more of the Indian mineral owners of a tract sought for lease request the Secretary to negotiate for a lease on their behalf without advertising. Unless the Secretary decides that negotiation of a mineral lease is in the best interests of the Indian mineral owners, he shall use the following procedure for leasing:

        (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements on lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate agency or area office for future reference.

        (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to a responsible bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary shall establish the rental and royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and will not be subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that acceptance of the lease bid by or on behalf of the Indian mineral owner is required. The requirements under § 212.21 are applicable to the acceptance of a lease bid.

        (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that bid is not accepted.

        (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.

        (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall also file the lease in completed form, signed by the Indian mineral owner(s), at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.

        (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete all requirements necessary for approval of the lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-advertise the tract for sale, or subject to the consent of the Indian mineral owner, a lease may be let through private negotiations.

        (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained. The requirements under § 212.21 are applicable to the approval of a mineral lease.

        § 212.21   Execution of leases.

#### § § 212.21

        (a) The Secretary shall not execute a mineral lease on behalf of an Indian mineral owner, except when such owner is deceased and the heirs to or devisee of the estate have not been determined, or if determined, some or all of them cannot be located. Leases involving such interests may be executed by the Secretary, provided that the mineral interest shall have been offered for sale under the provisions of section 212.20(b) (1) through (6).

        (b) The Secretary may execute leases on behalf of minors and persons who are incompetent by reason of mental incapacity;  that there is no parent, guardian, conservator, or other person who has lawful authority to execute a lease on behalf of the minor or person with mental incapacity.

        (c) If an owner is a life tenant, the procedures set forth in 25 CFR part 179 (Life Estates and Future Interests), shall apply.

        § 212.28   Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

#### § § 212.28

        (a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of agreements that allocate costs and benefits.

        (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is specifically required in the lease.

        (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be filed with the superintendent or area director.

        (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice requirement.

        (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.

        (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved before the lease expiration date.

        (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be effective on the date the agreement is effective.

        (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program approved by the authorized officer.

#### § § 212.29

        § 212.30   Removal of restrictions.

#### § § 212.30

        (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any mineral lease to the contrary, the removal of all restrictions against alienation shall operate to divest the Secretary of all supervisory authority and responsibility with respect to the lease. Thereafter, all payments required to be made under the lease shall be made directly to the owner(s).

        (b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land included in any lease approved by the Secretary, the entire lease shall continue to be subject to the supervision of the Secretary until such times as the holder of the lease and the unrestricted Indian owner submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that adequate arrangements have been made to account for the mineral resources of the restricted land separately from those of the unrestricted. Thereafter, the unrestricted portion shall be relieved from the supervision of the Secretary, the lease, the regulations of this part, and all other applicable laws and regulations.

        §§ 212.31-212.32   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 212.31-212.32

        § 212.33   Terms applying after relinquishment.

#### § § 212.33

        All leases for individual Indian lands approved by the Secretary under this part shall contain provisions for the relinquishment of supervision and provide for operations of the lease after such relinquishment. These leases shall contain provisions that address the following issues:

        (a)  If the Secretary relinquishes supervision at any time during the life of the lease instrument as to all or part of the acreage subject to the lease, the Secretary shall give the Indian mineral owner and the lessee thirty (30) days written notice prior to the termination of supervision. After notice of relinquishment has been given to the lessee, the lease shall be subject to the following conditions:

        (1) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid directly to the lessor or the lessor's successors in title, or to a trustee appointed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary, the lessee has made all payments then due and has fully performed all obligations on the lessee's part to be performed up to the time of such relinquishment, the bond given to secure the performance of the lease, on file in the appropriate agency or area office, shall be of no further force or effect.

        (3) Should relinquishment affect only part of the lease, then the lessee may continue to conduct operations on the land covered by the lease as an entirety;  that the lessee shall pay, in the manner prescribed by the lease and regulations for the benefit of lessor, the same proportion of all rentals and royalties due under the provisions of this part as the acreage retained under the supervision of the Secretary bears to the entire acreage of the lessee, and shall pay the remainder of the rentals and royalties directly to the remaining lessors or successors in title or said trustee as the case may be, as provided in paragraph (a) (1) of this section.

        (b)  If, after the execution of the lease and after the Secretary relinquishes supervision thereof, the fee of the leased land is divided into separate parcels held by different owners, or if the rental or royalty interest is divided in ownership, the obligations of the lessee shall not be modified in any manner except as specifically provided by the provisions of the lease. Notwithstanding such separate ownership, the lessee may continue to conduct operations on said premises as an entirety. Each separate owner shall receive such proportion of all rental and royalties accruing after the vesting of its title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty interest, bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the entire rental or royalty interest as the case may be. If at any time after departmental supervision of the lease is relinquished, in whole or in part, to rentals and royalties, whether said parties are so entitled by virtue of undivided interest or by virtue of ownership of separate parcels of the land covered, the lessee may elect to withhold the payment of further rentals or royalties (except as the portion due the Indian lessor while under restriction), until all of said parties shall agree upon and designate a trustee in writing and in a recordable instrument to receive all payments due thereunder on behalf of said parties and their respective successors in title. Payments to said trustee shall constitute lawful payments, and the sole risk of an improper or unlawful distribution of said funds by said trustee shall rest upon the parties naming said trustee and their said respective successors in title.

        § 212.34   Individual tribal assignments excluded.

#### § § 212.34

        The reference in this part to Indian mineral owners does not include assignments of tribal lands made pursuant to tribal constitutions or ordinances for the use of individual Indians and assignees of such lands.

This rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.

        (b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less than 16-  percent of the amount or value of production produced and sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area director if the approving official is the superintendent and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the area director.

        (c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.

      How To Acquire Leases

        § 213.2   Applications for leases.

#### § § 213.2

        Applications for leases should be made to the Area Director.

        § 213.3   No Government employee shall acquire leases.

#### § § 213.3

        No lease, assignment thereof, or interest therein will be approved to any employee or employees of the U.S. Government, whether connected with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or otherwise, and no employee of the Department of the Interior shall be permitted to acquire any interest in such leases covering restricted Indian lands by ownership of stock in corporations having leases or in any other manner.

        § 213.4   Sale of oil and gas leases.

#### § § 213.4

        (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, the Area Director shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the sale, unless a shorter period is authorized by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, each of which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to the highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall file with the Area Director the lease in completed form. The Area Director may, for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for the completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be forfeited for the use and benefit of the Indian lessor.

        (b) In cases where any part of the bonus bid for a lease is paid directly to the Indian lessor, upon his signing the lease, the lessee must procure and file with the lease an affidavit of the lessor, sworn to before a U.S. Commissioner, Postmaster, Area Director, local representative of the Area Director, county or district judge, Federal judge or clerk of a Federal court, showing the amount of bonus so paid, and the balance thereof must be paid into the office of the Area Director upon filing the lease. Where possible lessees are requested to take the lessor to the nearest United States field clerk who will render all proper assistance in the execution of leases, and before whom the bonus affidavit may be executed in cases where any part of bonus consideration is paid directly to the lessor. Where leases are executed by guardians, under order of court, the affidavit of lessor may be executed before a notary public.

        (c) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease or if the Secretary of the Interior shall determine that it is unwise in the interests of the Indians to accept the highest bid, the Secretary may readvertise such lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, with the consent of the Indian owners, a lease may be made by private negotiations. The successful bidder or bidders will be required to pay his or their share of the advertising costs. Amounts received from unsuccessful bidders will be returned; but when no bid is accepted on a tract, the costs of advertising will be assessed against the applicant who requested that said tract be advertised.

        § 213.5   Term of oil and gas leases.

#### § § 213.5

        Oil and gas mining leases which require the approval of the Secretary of the Interior may be made for periods of 10 years from the date of approval of lease by the Secretary of the Interior and as much longer thereafter as oil and/or gas is produced in paying quantities.

        § 213.6   Leases for minerals other than oil and gas.

#### § § 213.6

        Uncontested mining leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall be made on forms   prescribed by the Department, for a period of 15 years with the right of renewal on such terms as the superintendent may prescribe, and shall be subject only to approval by the Area Director. See provisions of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 408). Any persons aggrieved by any decision or order of the Area Director approving, rejecting, or disapproving any such lease may appeal from the same to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days from the date of such decision or order.

        § 213.7   Fees.

#### § § 213.7

        § 213.8   Filing of lease deemed constructive notice.

#### § § 213.8

        The filing of any lease in the office of the Area Director shall be deemed constructive notice of the existence of such lease. See act of March 1, 1907.

        § 213.9   Noncontiguous tracts.

#### § § 213.9

        No lease will be approved covering two or more noncontiguous tracts of land, but in such case a lease must be executed on each separate tract.

        § 213.10   Lessor's signature.

#### § § 213.10

        Any Indian who cannot write his name will be required to sign all official papers by making a distinct thumbprint which shall be designated as “right” or “left” thumbmark. Such signatures must be witnessed by two persons, one of whom must be a U.S. Government employee (such as field clerk, postmaster, U.S. Commissioner, etc.).

        § 213.11   Minor lessors.

#### § § 213.12

        Leases executed by guardians of minors under order of court for a period extending beyond the minority of the minor will be approved unless it appears that such action would be prejudicial to the interests of the minor:  That in the event the minor becomes of age within 1 year from the date of execution of lease the consent of the minor to the execution of the lease should be obtained and submitted with the lease for consideration.

        § 213.13   Inherited lands.

#### § § 213.13

        Except to prevent loss or waste, leases on undivided inherited lands will not be approved until the heirship determination has been approved. If the heirs to undivided inherited lands are undetermined or cannot be located, or if the heirs owning less than one-half interest in the lands refuse to sign a lease and it appears necessary to lease the lands to prevent loss or waste, the Area Director will report the facts to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and ask for instructions. Minor heirs can lease or joint adult heirs in leasing only through guardians under order of court. Proof of heirship shall be given upon Form F prescribed. If probate or other court proceedings have established the heirship in any case, or the land has been partitioned, certified copy of final order, judgment, or decree of the court will be accepted in lieu of Form F.

        § 213.14   Corporations and corporate information.

#### § § 213.14

        If the applicant for a lease is a corporation, it shall file evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its first application it shall also file a certified copy of its articles of incorporation, and, if foreign to the State in which the lands are located, evidence showing compliance with the corporation laws thereof. Statements of changes in officers and stockholders shall be furnished by a corporation lessee to the Area Director January 1 of each year, and at such other times as may be requested.

        Whenever deemed advisable in any case the Area Director may require a corporation applicant or lessee to file:

        (a) List of officers, principal stockholders, and directors, with post office addresses and numbers of shares held by each.

        (b) A sworn statement of the proper officer showing:

        (1) The total number of shares of the capital stock actually issued and the amount of cash paid into the treasury on each share sold; or, if paid in property, the kind of quantity and value of the same paid per share.

        (2) Of the stock sold, how much remains unpaid and subject to assessment.

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all rents, royalties and other payments due under leases which have been or may be approved in accordance with this part shall be paid by check or bank draft to the order of the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Area Director for deposit to the credit of the various lessors. When lessees and purchasers are instructed, in writing, by the Area Director, which instructions shall be complete as to lessors for each lease, separate remittances for each payment due each lessor shall be mailed to the Area Director. Any payments under this paragraph, covering lands or interests therein from which restrictions have been removed by death or otherwise, may continue to be made in the manner provided by this paragraph until ten days after notice of relinquishment of supervision has been mailed to the lessee.

        (b) The Area Director may, in his discretion, whenever it appears to be in the best interest of any lessor, authorize and direct the lessee to pay directly to the lessor, or to the legal guardian of any lessor under guardianship, the rents, royalties and other payments (other than bonuses and advance payments for the first year) due under leases which have been or may be approved in accordance with the regulations in this part. Any such authority for direct payment shall be in writing, addressed to the owner or owners of the lease, and shall expressly provide for its revocation or modification at any time, in writing, by the Area Director. Written authorization for direct payment and written revocations or modifications thereof shall become a part of the lease and shall be distributed as in the case of original leases. All such revocations or modifications shall have a 5-day grace period after date of receipt. Rents, royalties, and other payments paid in accordance therewith shall constitute full compliance with the requirements of the lease pertaining to such payments.

        (c) Rents and royalties paid pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on producing leases shall be supported by statements, acceptable to the Secretary or his duly authorized representative, to be transmitted to the Supervisor, in duplicate, covering each lease, identified by contract number and lease number. Such statements shall show the specific items of rents or royalties for which remittances are made, and shall identify each remittance by the remittance number, date, amount, and name of each payee.

        (d) Rents paid on nonproducing leases pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be supported by a statement, acceptable to the Area Director, to be transmitted to the Area Director covering each lease, identified by contract number and lease number. Each remittance shall be identified by the remittance number, date, amount, name of each payee, and dates of mailing of remittances. Date of mailing, or, if remittance is sent by registered mail, the date of registration receipts covering remittances mailed, shall be considered as date of payment.

        (e) For leases other than oil and gas, all advance rentals and royalties for the first year shall be paid to the Area Director at the time of filing the lease, and the advance royalty and 20 percent of the first year's rental so paid shall be and become the property of the lessor, if the lease be disapproved because of the lessee's failure to meet the requirements of the law or of the regulations in this part or because of any other fault or defect chargeable to the lessee.

No refund of such advance payments made under any lease will be allowed in the event the royalty on production is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; nor will any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee because of any subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.

        § 213.20   [Reserved]

#### § § 213.20

A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of supervision, “value” for the purposes of the lease may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior be calculated on the basis of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in storage by causes beyond his control.

        § 213.25   Free use of gas by lessor.

#### § § 213.25

        If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for all stoves and inside lights in the principal dwelling house on said premises, by making his own connections to a regulator, connected to the well and maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's risk at all times.

#### § § 213.26

        (a) On casing-head gas used or sold for the manufacture of casing-head gasoline the minimum rate of royalty shall be 12  percent of the value of the casing-head gas, which value shall be determined and computed on the basis and in the manner provided in the applicable operating regulations of the Department.

        (b) Quarterly reports shall be made by each lessee on nonproducing leases other than oil and gas within 25 days after December 31, March 31, June 30, and September 30, of each year, upon forms provided, showing manner of operations and total production during such quarter. A lessee may include within one sworn statement all leases upon which there is no production or upon which dry holes have been drilled. Reports of oil and gas leases where royalty accounting is done in the field office of the supervisor will be made as required in the operating regulations.

        § 213.29   Division orders.

#### § § 213.29

        (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil and gas for the payment of the royalties as provided for in the lease and the regulations but such arrangement, if made, shall not operate to relieve a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this privilege, division orders should be executed by the lessee and forwarded to the supervisor for approval. Purchasers may be authorized by the supervisor to reimburse lessees out of royalties for advance rents and advance royalties. Copies of written instructions, notices, modifications, revocations, and authorizations, as provided for in § 213.18 (a) and (b), shall be furnished to purchasers. The right is reserved for the supervisor to cancel a division order at any time or require the purchaser to discontinue to run the oil of any lessee who fails to operate the lease properly or otherwise violates the provisions of the lease, of the regulations in this part, or of the operating regulations.

        (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gauged and records are made of the temperature, gravity, and impurities. The lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which, except lowest gauge, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the pipeline.

      All royalties belonging to the lessor shall be paid to the superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at Miami, Okla., or such other official as the Secretary of the Interior may designate, for the benefit of the lessor, not later than 15 days from the 1st of each month for ore and concentrates sold during the preceding month.

      § 215.4   Leases to be sold at public auction.

#### § § 215.4

      Except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this part, no lead and zinc mining lease under this part of restricted or trust allotted and inherited Indian lands within and under the Quapaw Indian Agency shall be made except to the highest responsible bidder at public auction.

      § 215.5   Royalty rates.

#### § § 215.5

      (a) In leases offered for sale at public auction under the regulations in this part the royalty to be paid by the lessee shall be stipulated at a fixed percent of the gross proceeds of all lead and zinc ores and concentrates extracted from the leased premises, the royalty to be computed and based upon each sale of ore or concentrates separately, the rate of royalty to be determined and fixed by the Secretary of the Interior in the case of each lease prior to the offering of such lease for sale. Subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to reject any and all bids, leases offered for sale at public auction shall be awarded in each case to the responsible bidder submitting the highest bonus offer.

      (b) In leases not offered for sale at public auction but otherwise made and entered into under the provisions of the regulations in this part the royalty stipulated and fixed therein shall be such as may be determined by the Secretary of the Interior or as may be agreed upon in each case, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

      (c) It shall be further provided, however, that said sale-price basis for the determination of the rates and amount of royalty shall not be less than the highest and best obtainable market price of the lead and zinc ores and concentrates at the usual and customary place of disposing of such ores and concentrates at the time of sale:  That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior to determine and declare such market price if it is deemed necessary for him to do so for the protection of the interests of the Indian lessor:  That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior on behalf of the Indian lessors to reserve at any time it shall be deemed to be to the best interests of the Indian lessors and upon due notice to the lessee, the royalty share of the gross production of the ore and concentrates and upon such notice that the royalty share of such production shall be stored and not sold, the lessee shall be required to store, free of charge to the Indian lessors in the ore bins of said lessee, said royalty shares of the gross production of ore and concentrates, provided that the lessee may not be required to store ore or concentrates for the lessor in amounts greater than one-third of his bin capacity or for a period longer than 6 months.

      § 215.6   Applications for leases; consent of Indian owners.

#### § § 215.6

      (a) Applications or requests by the Indian owners of restricted or trust land, or by others, that such land be leased or offered for lease for lead and zinc mining purposes should be addressed to the Secretary of the Interior and submitted through the superintendent of the Quapaw Indian Agency. Upon receipt of such applications or requests, the superintendent shall give consideration thereto and forward the same to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation.

      (b) In no instance will a new lease be executed and delivered (or advertised for sale to the highest bidder) unless the Indian owner thereof, if an adult who has not been specifically found by the Secretary of the Interior to be personally incompetent to transact ordinary business affairs, has agreed to the terms of said lease or the terms under which said lease is advertised for lease, except in cases where the land is owned by several co-tenants, and, in such cases, no such lease shall be given or advertised for sale unless the co-owners or a majority in interest, if adults, and not specifically declared incompetent, have first consented thereto:  That in the event the majority in interest is owned by minors, or adults specifically found to be incompetent, then and in that event, the Secretary of the Interior reserves the right to lease the entire tract if, in his opinion, such leasing will inure to the best interest of the restricted Indian owners.

      § 215.7   Advertisement of sale of leases.

#### § § 215.7

      Upon authority being granted by the Secretary of the Interior to the superintendent to offer for sale at public auction a lead and zinc mining lease of any tract or tracts of restricted or trust allotted and inherited Indian lands, the superintendent shall cause a notice to be published once a week for at least 4 weeks in some designated newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land is located, setting forth that upon a certain day, which shall be not less than 30 days from the first publication of such notice and at a place to be named in the notice, the superintendent or other duly authorized representatives of the Secretary of the Interior will offer for sale at public auction a lead and zinc mining lease of such lands to the highest and best bidder, subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, notice to be in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.

      § 215.8   Submission of bids.

#### § § 215.8

      At the time of public auction bidders may submit their bids in person or by authorized agents, but in the latter case the bids must be accompanied by power of attorney duly executed by the real party or person in interest. Sealed bids may be submitted by mail or otherwise to the superintendent at his office at Miami, Okla., or delivered to him at the place set for the sale at any time prior to the hour fixed for offering the lease for sale. At the time and place of the public auction and before receiving the public bids the officer in charge shall announce the amounts and terms of all sealed bids received by him and the names of the bidders. The persons present, including those, if any, who may have theretofore submitted sealed bids, shall then be allowed to offer public bids. Bids must contain the offer of the stipulated and fixed royalty (see § 215.5 as to royalty) and, in addition thereto, the offer of a bonus payable as follows: 25 percent at time of sale and the balance before or at time of execution of the lease contract. Bidders shall be required to submit with their bids a draft or certified check payable to the order of the superintendent covering the advance rental for the first year on the proposed leasehold and 25 percent of the amount of the bonus offered. The superintendent shall, in each case, determine the highest and best bid, said determination, however, to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Upon approval by the Secretary of the Interior of the award, the successful bidder shall, within 30 days from notice thereof, enter into and execute the lease contract in accordance with said bid and the regulations in this part. The lease so executed shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and may be accepted or rejected by him when submitted for his approval. The right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior, in the event of the rejection of such lease, to authorize and instruct the superintendent to accept the offer of some competitive bidder or to readvertise the land for lease. The report of the superintendent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs relative to the auction sale shall contain full information as to all bids received for the lease rights on the land. If any person or party fails or refuses to execute a lease after being declared the highest bidder or after being awarded such lease, the amount tendered with his bid shall be forfeited to the superintendent for the benefit of the owner of the land.

      § 215.9   Execution of leases.

#### § § 215.9

      Whenever a lease award to a proposed lessee has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, as provided in §§ 215.7 and 215.8, the lease contract shall be executed by the Indian owner of the land, if he be an adult and not incompetent as defined in § 215.0(c). Before any lease is entered into by the Indian owners or is approved by the Secretary of the Interior, all the adult and competent owners or co-owners of the tract of land which it is proposed to lease, shall be furnished by the Bureau such geological reports as may be available or that can be secured from the representative of the Geological Survey showing the estimated mineral reserves on said property, the estimated reasonable value of such property for mining purposes, and such other data as might reasonably be necessary to fully advise the owners of said property of the then present status and mining value of their lands. If the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor, or is otherwise an incompetent as defined in the regulations in this part, the lease contract shall be executed by the superintendent for and on behalf of such minor or such incompetent. The leases executed, either by the Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent in his behalf, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall be effective only upon such approval.

      § 215.10   Renewal of leases on developed lands.

#### § § 215.10

      (a) In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased, and lead and zinc ores have been discovered hereon, and it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior to be advisable and to the best interests of the Indian owners of the lands that the terms of the existing lease or leases be extended or that a new lease or leases for an additional period of time, or that a new lease or leases to take effect upon the expiration of present valid leases, should, upon application therefor, be granted to either the present lessees or to parties holding under assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, from such present lessees, or to parties who have expended capital in lead and zinc mining operation and development of the land under such leases, assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, a new lease or leases or contract of extension or existing lease or leases as may be authorized by the Secretary of the Interior may be entered into with the proper party or parties as may be determined by said Secretary of the Interior, and such new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases shall be executed subject to the regulations in this part by and between the Indian owner of the land, if an adult and not incompetent as defined in § 215.0 (c), and said proper party or parties. If the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor or an otherwise incompetent as defined in § 215.0 (c), the superintendent shall execute the new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases for and on behalf of said Indian minor or incompetent. Said new leases or contracts of extension of old leases, whether executed by the Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent for and in his behalf, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall become effective only upon such approval. No offering for sale at public auction or advertisement of sale will be necessary in reference to contracts of extension of leases, or to leases entered into under this section, as above provided, but such lease or contract shall be upon such terms as to bonus and royalty as may be determined and fixed in each case by the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of § 215.5. The approval by the Secretary of the Interior of new leases or of the contracts of extension of old leases shall be conclusive as to the validity of said leases, or contracts of extension of leases, the manner and method of negotiating the same, and the execution thereof. If, however, in any case where lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been discovered thereon, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior that the extension of the existing lease or leases or the granting of new leases to the present lessees, or to the persons or parties holding under said lessees by assignment, sublease, or mining contract, would not be to the best interests of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior may, at the expiration, cancellation, or forfeiture of the existing lease, cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure shall be followed as provided in §§ 215.7 through 215.9.

      (b) Applications under the provision of this section for a lease or extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of lease will not be received or considered prior to the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land covered by such application.

      (c) Applications under the provisions of this section for a lease or extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of lease shall be filed with the superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at any time within the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land covered by such application, and if the records of or papers in the office of said superintendent or the records of the county court of Ottawa County, Okla., indicate that there are any prior existing leases, subleases, assignments of leases or mining contracts covering any of the land applied for, the superintendent shall notify all persons having or claiming any rights or interest in or under said prior existing leases, subleases, assignments of leases, or mining contract concerning said application for lease or extension of lease, and that they will be allowed 10 days in which to file with the superintendent any objection they may have to the allowance of the application or to the approval of the new lease or extension of existing lease. If objection or protest is made by any owner of the land or by any person claiming rights or interests in or under existing lease, sublease, assignment of lease, or mining contract, a reasonable time, not exceeding 20 days, shall be allowed them in which to file their statement or brief in support of their protest or objection, and a reasonable further time not exceeding 10 days shall be allowed the applicant for new lease or for extension of existing lease to reply in support of the application. In case of contest, hearings may be had if deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior or his representative. The application and papers in each case shall be forwarded by the superintendent of the Quapaw Indian Agency to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation in regard thereto.

      § 215.11   New leases where prior leases have been forfeited or abandoned.

#### § § 215.11

      In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been discovered but the mines and mining operations have been abandoned and the leases have been canceled or forfeited or have expired, special arrangements in the matter of the leasing and mining of said lands may be made provided the consent thereto of the Secretary of the Interior be first obtained. Applications containing special offers as to the terms and conditions may be considered by the Secretary of the Interior and the leasing of said lands may be made upon such special terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may in each case deem to be for the best interests of the Indian owners of the land. If, however, in any case, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior that the granting of such lease would not be to the best interest of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior may cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure shall be followed as provided in §§ 215.7 through 215.9.

      § 215.12   Advertising costs.

#### § § 215.12

      All advertising costs, publication fees, expenses incurred for abstracts of lease title, and other expenses incurred in connection with the advertising and sale of leases and in connection with the execution of lease contracts shall be borne by the lessee. In the event a lease of the land is offered to the highest bidder and he fails or refuses to execute such lease when duly notified and as required by or under the regulations in this part, and no other bid is accepted, such costs, fees, and expenses shall be paid from such money as he may have paid with his bid. If no bid is tendered after a tract is advertised, or if all bids are refused, said items of expenses shall be charged to the Indian owner of the land and be paid by him or be paid by the superintendent from any funds held by such superintendent to the credit of such Indian owner of the land.

      § 215.13   Bond.

#### § § 215.13

      Every mineral lease made and entered into under the regulations in this part, by an Indian or by the superintendent as his representative or in his behalf, must be accompanied by a surety bond, executed by the lessee and by a responsible surety company or two or more satisfactory sureties, guaranteeing the payment of all deferred installments of bonus and the payment of all specified royalties and rentals and the performance of all covenants and agreements undertaken by the lessee. Such bonds, unless authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, with the consent of the Indian landowner, shall be not less than the following amounts:

      That the lessee may, in lieu of such surety bond and upon execution of a proper penal bond to the United States in the sum prescribed and a proper power of attorney to the Secretary of the Interior, submit therewith United States bonds or notes in the aggregate sum prescribed as security for the carrying out of the terms, conditions, and provisions of the lease:  That a lessee may file in lieu of such individual lease bonds, one bond in a sum to be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior covering all leases to which he is or may become a party. The right is specifically reserved to the Secretary of the Interior to require an increase of the amount of any bond above the sum named in any particular case where he deems it necessary to require such increased bond.

        § 216.4   Technical examination of prospective surface exploration and mining operations.

#### § § 216.4

        (a)(1) In connection with an application for a permit or lease, the superintendent shall make, or cause to be made, a technical examination of the prospective effects of the proposed exploration or surface mining operations upon the environment. The technical examination shall take into consideration the need for the preservation and protection of other resources, including cultural, recreational, scenic, historic, and ecological values; and control of erosion, flooding, and pollution of water; the isolation of toxic materials; the prevention of air pollution; the reclamation by revegetation, replacement of soil or by other means, of lands affected by the exploration or mining operations; the prevention of slides; the protection of fish and wildlife and their habitat; and the prevention of hazards to public health and safety.

        (2) A technical examination of an area should be made with the recognition that actual potential mining sites and mining operations vary widely with respect to topography, climate, surrounding land uses, proximity to densely used areas, and other environmental influences and that mining and reclamation requirements should provide sufficient flexibility to permit adjustment to local conditions.

        (b) Based upon the technical examination, the superintendent shall formulate the general requirements which the applicant must meet for the protection of nonmineral resources during the conduct of exploration or mining operations and for the reclamation of lands or waters affected by exploration or mining operations. The general requirements shall be made known in writing to the applicant before the issuance of a permit or lease and upon acceptance thereof by the applicant, shall be incorporated in the permit or lease.

        (c) In each instance in which an application is made the mining supervisor shall participate in the technical examination and in the formulation of the general requirements.

        (d) The superintendent may prohibit or otherwise restrict operations on any part of an area whenever it is determined that such part of the area described in an application for a permit or lease is such that previous experience under similar conditions has shown that operations cannot feasibly be conducted by any known methods or measures to avoid—

        (1) Rock or landslides which would be a hazard to human lives or endanger or destroy private or public property; or

        (2) Substantial deposition of sediment and silt into streams, lakes, reservoirs; or

        (3) A lowering of water quality below standards established by the appropriate State water pollution control agency, or by the Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized representative; or

        (4) A lowering of the quality of waters whose quality exceeds that required by the established standards—unless and until it has been affirmatively demonstrated to the Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized representative, that such lowering of quality is necessary to economic and social development and will not preclude any assigned uses made of such waters; or

        (5) The destruction of key wildlife habitat or important scenic, historical, or other natural or cultural features.

        (e) If, on the basis of a technical examination, the superintendent determines that there is a likelihood that there will be a lowering of water quality as described in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section caused by the operation, no lease or permit shall be issued until after consultation with the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration and a finding by the Administration that the proposed operation would not be in violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 466 ), or of Executive Order No. 11288 (31 FR 9261). Where a permit or lease is involved the Superintendent's determination shall be made in consultation with the mining supervisor.

        § 216.5   Basis for denial of a permit or lease.

#### § § 216.5

        An application for a permit or lease to conduct exploratory or mining operations may be denied any applicant who has forfeited a required bond because of failure to comply with a mining plan. However, a permit or lease may not be denied an applicant because of the forfeiture of a bond if the lands disturbed under his previous permit or lease have subsequently been reclaimed without cost to the lessor or the United States.

        § 216.6   Approval of exploration plan.

#### § § 216.6

        (a) Before commencing any surface disturbing operations to explore, test or prospect for minerals, the operator shall file with the mining supervisor a plan for the proposed exploration operations.

The mining supervisor shall promptly notify the operator that he consents to the proposed changes or supplement, or in the event he does not consent, he shall specify the modifications thereto under which the proposed changes or supplement would be acceptable. After mutual acceptance of a change of a plan, the operator shall not depart therefrom without further approval.

        (g) If circumstances warrant or if development of a mining plan for the entire operation is dependent upon unknown factors which cannot or will not be determined except during the progress of the operations, a partial plan may be approved and supplemented from time to time. The operator shall not, however, perform any operation except under an approved plan.

        § 216.8   Performance bond.

#### § § 216.8

        (a) Upon approval of an exploration plan or mining plan, the operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond of not less than $2,000 with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of the Interior, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, lease, or contract, and the exploration or mining plan as approved, amended or supplemented.

        (a) The Act (25 U.S.C. 3504(e)(6)) preserves the Secretary's trust responsibilities relating to mineral and other trust resources and requires the Secretary to act in good faith and in the best interest of Indian Tribes.

        (b) Neither the Act nor this part absolves the Secretary of responsibilities to Indian Tribes under the trust relationship, treaties, statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, agreements or other Federal law.

        (c) The Act and this part preserve the Secretary's trust responsibility to ensure that the rights and interests of an Indian Tribe are protected if:

        (1) Another party to a lease, business agreement, or right-of-way executed under an approved TERA violates any term of the lease, business agreement, or right-of-way, or any applicable Federal law; or

        (2) Any provision of a lease, business agreement, or right-of-way violates the TERA under which it was executed.

        (d) The United States is not liable for losses to any party (including any Tribe) for any negotiated term of, or any loss resulting from, the negotiated terms of a lease, business agreement, or right-of-way the Tribe executes under a TERA.

          (ii) Whether the Tribe provided the information voluntarily and, if so, how the information fits into a category of information that the Tribe customarily does not release to the public;

          (2) A certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the Tribe, and is essentially non-public because it is not routinely available to the public from other sources;

The notice will also inform the Tribe that it intends to release the records within 10 working days after the Tribe's receipt of the notice.

      Subpart A—General

        § 225.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 225.1

        (a) The regulations in this part, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, govern minerals agreements for the development of Indian-owned minerals entered into pursuant to the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 U.S.C. 2101-2108 (IMDA). These regulations are applicable to the lands or interests in lands of any Indian tribe, individual Indian or Alaska native the title to which is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. These regulations are intended to ensure that Indian mineral owners are permitted to enter into minerals agreements that will allow the Indian mineral owners to have more responsibility in overseeing and greater flexibility in disposing of their mineral resources, and to allow development in the manner which the Indian mineral owners believe will maximize their best economic interest and minimize any adverse environmental or cultural impact resulting from such development. Pursuant to section 4 of the IMDA (25 U.S.C. 2103(e)), as part of this greater flexibility, where the Secretary has approved a minerals agreement in compliance with the provisions of 25 U.S.C. chap. 23 and any other applicable provision of law, the United States shall not be liable for losses sustained by a tribe or individual Indian under such minerals agreement. However, as further stated in the IMDA, the Secretary continues to have a trust obligation to ensure that the rights of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a violation of the terms of any minerals agreement, and to uphold the duties of the United States as derived from the trust relationship and from any treaties, executive orders, or agreements between the United States and any Indian tribe.

        (b) The regulations in this part shall become effective and in full force on April 29, 1994, and shall be subject to amendment at any time by the Secretary;  that no such regulation that becomes effective after the date of approval of any minerals agreement shall operate to affect the duration of the minerals agreement, the rate of royalty or financial consideration, rental, or acreage unless agreed to by all parties to the minerals agreement.

        (c) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management Service that are referenced in §§ 225.4, 225.5, and 225.6 are supplemental to these regulations, and apply to minerals agreements for development of Indian mineral resources unless specifically stated otherwise in this part or in other Federal regulations. To the extent the parties to a minerals agreement are able to provide reasonable provisions satisfactorily addressing the issues of valuation, method of payment, accounting, and auditing, governed by the Minerals Management Service regulations, the Secretary may approve alternate provisions in a minerals agreement.

        (d) Nothing in these regulations is intended to prevent Indian tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to regulate the conduct of persons, businesses, or minerals operations within their territorial jurisdiction.

        § 225.2   Information collection.

#### § § 225.2

#### § § 225.31

        Unless specified otherwise in the minerals agreement, after production has been established, all payments due for royalties, bonuses, rentals and other payments under a minerals agreement shall be made to the Secretary or such other party as may be designated, and shall be made at such time as provided in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. Prior to production, all bonus and rental payments, shall be made to the Superintendent or Area Director.

        § 225.32   Permission to start operations.

#### § § 225.32

        (a) No exploration, drilling, or mining operations are permitted on any Indian lands before the Secretary has granted written approval of the minerals agreement pursuant to the regulations. After a minerals agreement is approved, written permission to start operations must be secured by applying for the permits referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) Applicable permits in accordance with rules and regulations in 30 CFR part 750, 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, 3590, and Orders or Notices to Lessees (NTL) issued thereunder shall be required before actual operations are conducted on the minerals agreement acreage.

        § 225.33   Assignment of minerals agreements.

#### § § 225.33

        An assignment of a minerals agreement, or any interest therein, shall not be valid without the approval of the Secretary and, if required in the minerals agreement, the Indian mineral owner. The assignee must be qualified to hold the minerals agreement and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned on the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof as stipulated in the minerals agreement. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed with the Secretary within five (5) working days after execution by all parties. The Secretary may permit the release of any bonds executed by the assignor upon submission of satisfactory bonds to the Bureau of Indian Affairs by the assignee, and a determination that the assignor has satisfied all accrued obligations.

        § 225.34   [Reserved]

#### § § 225.34

        § 225.35   Inspection of premises; books and accounts.

#### § § 225.35

        (a) Operators shall allow Indian mineral owners, their authorized representatives, or any authorized representatives of the Secretary to enter all parts of the minerals agreement area for the purpose of inspection. Operators shall keep a full and correct account of all operations and submit all related reports required by the minerals agreement and applicable regulations. Books and records shall be available for inspection during regular business hours.

        (b) Operators shall provide records to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) in accordance with MMS regulations and guidelines. All records pertaining to a minerals agreement shall be maintained by an operator in accordance with 30 CFR part 212.

        (d) Operators shall provide records to the Director's Representative in accordance with OSMRE regulations and guidelines.

        § 225.36   Minerals agreement cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.

#### § § 225.36

        (a) If the Secretary determines that an operator has failed to comply with the regulations in this part; other applicable laws or regulations; the terms of the minerals agreement; the requirements of an approved exploration, drilling or mining plan; Secretarial orders; or the orders of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official, the Secretary may:

        (1) Serve a notice of noncompliance; or

        (2) Serve a notice of proposed cancellation.

        (b) The notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect the operator has failed to comply with the requirements referenced in paragraph (a), and shall specify what actions, if any, must be taken to correct the noncompliance.

        (c) The notice of proposed cancellation shall set forth the reasons why cancellation is proposed.

        (d) The notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance shall be served upon the operator by delivery in person or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's last known address. When certified mail is used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when received or five (5) working days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.

        (e) The operator shall have thirty (30) days (or such longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance is served to respond, in writing, to the Superintendent or Area Director actually issuing the notice.

        (f) If an operator fails to take any action that may be prescribed in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a timely written response to the notice, or files a written response that does not, in the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the operator's failure to comply, then the Secretary may cancel the minerals agreement, specifying the basis for the cancellation. Cancellation of a minerals agreement shall not relieve the operator of any continuing obligation under the minerals agreement.

        (g) If an operator fails to take corrective action or to file a timely written response adequately justifying the operator's actions pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary may issue an order of cessation. If the operator fails to comply with the order of cessation, or fails to timely file an appeal of the order of cessation pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the Secretary may issue an order of minerals agreement cancellation.

        (h) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian mineral owner as set forth in the minerals agreement.

        (i) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official to take any enforcement action authorized pursuant to statute or regulation.

        (j) The Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, the MMS Official, and the Superintendent or Area Director should consult with one another before taking any enforcement actions.

        (k) If orders of cessation or minerals agreement cancellation issued pursuant to this section are issued by a designee of the Secretary other than the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, the orders may be appealed under 25 CFR part 2. If the orders are issued by the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, and not one of their delegates or subordinates, the orders are the final orders of the Department.

        § 225.37   Penalties.

#### § § 225.37

        (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under § 225.36, violations of the terms and conditions of any minerals agreement, the regulations in this part, other applicable laws or regulations, or failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a cessation order issued by the Secretary may subject an operator to a penalty of not more than $2,057 per day for each day that such a violation or noncompliance continues beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action.

        (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the operator either personally or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date received or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.

        (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the operator of the operator's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be held before the Superintendent or Area Director whose findings shall be conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2. If within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of proposed penalty the operator has not requested a hearing or paid the amount of the proposed penalty, a final notice of penalty shall be served.

        (d) If the person served with a notice of proposed penalty requests a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the time limits presented for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a written suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a suspension will not be detrimental to the Indian mineral owner and upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the Indian mineral owner from loss or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.

        (e) Payment of penalties in full more than ten (10) days after a final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the operator to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific minerals agreement provision prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments shall be a rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is late.

        (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:

        (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official to impose penalties under applicable statutory or regulatory authorities;

        (2) Replacing, superseding, or replicating any penalty provision in the terms and conditions of a minerals agreement approved by the Secretary pursuant to this part; or

        (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of minerals agreement provisions for which the Authorized Officer, Director's Representative, or MMS Official has either statutory or regulatory authority to assess a penalty.

        § 226.2   Sale of leases.

#### § § 226.2

        (a) Written application, together with any nomination fee, for tracts to be offered for lease shall be filed with the Superintendent.

        (b) The Superintendent, with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council, shall publish notices for the sale of oil leases, gas leases, and oil and gas leases to the highest responsible bidder on specific tracts of the unleased Osage Mineral Estate. The Superintendent may require any bidder to submit satisfactory evidence of his good faith and ability to comply with all provisions of the notice of sale. Successful bidders must deposit with the Superintendent on day of sale a check or cash in an amount not less than 25 percent of the cash bonus offered as a guaranty of good faith. Any and all bids shall be subject to the acceptance of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent. Within 20 days after notification of being the successful bidder, and said bidder must submit to the Superintendent the balance of the cash bonus, a $10 filing fee, and the lease in completed form. The Superintendent may extend the time for the completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be granted for remitting the balance of moneys due. If the bidder fails to pay the full cash consideration within said period or fails to file the completed lease within said period or extention thereof, or if the lease is rejected through no fault of the Osage Tribal Council or the Superintendent, 25 percent of the cash bonus bid will be forfeited for the use and benefits of the Osage Tribe. The Superintendent may reject a lease made on an accepted bid, upon evidence satisfactory to him of collusion, fraud, or other irregularity in connection with the notice of sale. The Superintendent may approve oil leases, gas leases, and oil and gas leases made by the Osage Tribal Council in conformity with the notice of sale, regulations in this part, bonds, and other instruments required.

        (c) Each oil and/or gas lease and activities and installations associated therewith subject to these regulations shall be assessed and evaluated for its environmental impact prior to its approval by the Superintendent.

        (d) Lessee shall accept a lease with the understanding that a mineral not covered by his lease may be leased separately.

        (e) No lease, assignment thereof, or interest therein will be approved to any employee or employees of the Government and no such employee shall be permitted to acquire any interest in leases covering the Osage Mineral Estate by ownership of stock in corporations having leases or in any other manner.

        (f) The Osage Tribal Council may utilize the following procedures among others, in entering into a mining lease. A contract may be entered into through competitive bidding as outlined in § 226.2(b), negotiation, or a combination of both. The Osage Tribal Council may also request the Superintendent to undertake the preparation, advertisement and negotiation. The Superintendent may approve any such contract made by the Osage Tribal Council.

        § 226.3   Surrender of lease.

#### § § 226.3

        Lessee may, with the approval of the Superintendent and payment of a $10 filing fee, surrender all or any portion of any lease, have the lease cancelled as to the portion surrendered and be relieved from all subsequent obligations and liabilities. If the lease, or portion being surrendered, is owned in undivided interests by more than one party, then all parties shall join in the application for cancellation:  That if this lease has been recorded, Lessee shall execute a release and record the same in the proper office. Such surrender shall not entitle Lessee to a refund of the unused portion of rental paid in lieu of development, nor shall it relieve Lessee and his sureties of any obligation and liability incurred prior to such surrender:  That when there is a partial surrender of any lease and the acreage to be retained is less than 160 acres or there is a surrender of a separate horizon, such surrender shall become only with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent.

        § 226.4   Form of payment.

#### § § 226.4

        Sums due under a lease contract and/or the regulations in this part shall be paid by cash or check made payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and delivered to the Osage Agency, Pawhuska, Oklahoma 74056. Such sums shall be a prior lien on all equipment and unsold oil on the leased premises.

        § 226.5   Leases subject to current regulations.

#### § § 226.5

        Leases issued pursuant to this part shall be subject to the current regulations of the Secretary, all of which are made a part of such leases:  That no amendment or change of such regulations made after the approval of any lease shall operate to affect the term of the lease, rate of royalty, rental, or acreage unless agreed to by both parties and approved by the Superintendent.

        § 226.6   Bonds.

#### § § 226.6

        Lessees shall furnish with each lease a corporate surety bond acceptable to the Superintendent as follows:

        (a) A bond on Form D shall be filed with each lease submitted for approval. Such bond shall be in an amount of not less than $5,000 for each quarter section or fractional quarter section covered by said lease:  That one bond in the penal sum or not less than $50,000 may be filed on Form G covering all oil, gas and combination oil and gas leases not in excess of 10,240 acres to which Lessee is or may become a party.

        (b) In lieu of the bonds required under paragraph (a) of this section, a bond in the penal sum of $150,000 may be filed on Form 5-5438 for full nationwide coverage of all leases, without geographic or acreage limitation, to which the Lessee is or may become a party.

        (c) A bond on Form H shall be filed in an amount of not less than $5,000 covering a lease acquired through assignment where the assignee does not have a collective bond on form G or nationwide bond, or the corporate surety does not execute its consent to remain bound under the original bond given to secure the faithful performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.

        (d) The right is specifically reserved to increase the amount of bonds prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in any particular case when the Superintendent deems it proper. The nationwide bond may be increased at any time in the discretion of the Secretary.

        § 226.7   Provisions of forms made a part of the regulations.

#### § § 226.7

        Leases, assignments, and supporting instruments shall be in the form prescribed by the Secretary, and such forms are hereby made a part of the regulations.

        § 226.8   Corporation and corporate information.

#### § § 226.8

        (a) If the applicant for a lease is a corporation, it shall file evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its first application it shall also file a certified copy of its Articles of Incorporation and, if foreign to the State of Oklahoma, evidence showing compliance with the corporation laws thereof.

        (b) Whenever deemed advisable the Superintendent may require a corporation to file any additional information necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of the regulations in this part, and such information shall be furnished within a reasonable time.

        § 226.9   Rental and drilling obligations.

#### § § 226.9

        (a) Oil leases, gas leases, and combination oil and gas leases. Unless Lessee shall complete and place on production a well producing and selling oil and/or gas in paying quantities on the land embraced within the lease within 12 months from the date of approval of the lease, or as otherwise provided in the lease terms, or 12 months from the date the Superintendent consents to drilling on any restricted homestead selection, the lease shall terminate unless rental at the rate of not less than $1 per acre for an oil or gas lease, or not less than $2.00 per acre for a combination oil and gas lease, shall be paid before the end of the first year of the lease. The lease may also be held for the remainder of its primary term without drilling upon payment of the specified rental annually in advance, commencing with the second lease year. The lease shall terminate as of the due date of the rental unless such rental shall be received by the Superintendent, or shall have been mailed as indicated by postmark on or before said date. The completion of a well producing in paying quantities shall, for so long as such production continues, relieve Lessee from any further payment of rental, except that should such production cease during the primary term the lease may be continued only during the remaining primary term of the lease by payment of advance rental which shall commence on the next anniversary date of the lease. Rental shall be paid on the basis of a full year and no refund will be made of advance rental paid in compliance with the regulations in this part:  That the Superintendent in his discretion may order further development of any leased acreage or separate horizon if, in his opinion, a prudent operator would conduct further development. If Lessee refuses to comply, the refusal will be considered a violation of the lease terms and said lease shall be subject to cancellation as to the acreage or horizon the further development of which was ordered:  That the Superintendent may impose restrictions as to time of drilling and rate of production from any well or wells when in his judgment, such action may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources of the leased land and the interests of the Osage Tribe. The superintendent may consider, among other things, Federal and Oklahoma laws regulating either drilling or production. If a lessee holds both an oil lease and a gas lease covering the same acreage, such lessee is subject to the provisions of this section as to both the oil lease and the gas lease.

        (b) The Superintendent may, with the consent of and under terms approved by the Osage Tribal Council, grant an extension of the primary term of a lease on which the actual drilling of a well shall have commenced within the term thereof or for the purpose of enabling Lessee to obtain a market for his oil and/or gas production.

        § 226.10   Term of lease.

#### § § 226.10

        Leases issued hereunder shall be for a primary term as established by the Osage Tribal Council, approved by the Superintendent, and so stated in the notice of sale of such leases and so long thereafter as the minerals specified are produced in paying quantities.

        § 226.11   Royalty payments.

#### § § 226.11

        (a) —(1)  Lessee shall pay or cause to be paid to the Superintendent, as royalty, the sum of not less than 162/3 percent of the gross proceeds from sales after deducting the oil used by Lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease:  That when the quantity of oil taken from all the producing wells on any quarter-section or fraction thereof, according to the public survey, during any calendar month is sufficient to average one hundred or more barrels per active producing well per day the royalty on such oil shall be not less than 20 percent. The Osage Tribal Council may, upon presentation of justifiable economic evidence by Lessee, agree to a revised royalty rate subject to approval by the Superintendent, applicable to additional oil produced from a lease or leases by enhanced recovery methods, which rate shall not be less than 121/2 percent of the gross proceeds from sale of oil produced by enhanced recovery processes, other than gas injection, after deducting the oil used by Lessee for development and operating purposes on the lease or leases.

        (2) Unless the Osage Tribal Council, with approval of the Secretary, shall elect to take the royalty in kind, payment is owing at the time of sale or removal of the oil, except where payments are made on division orders, and settlement shall be based on the actual selling price, but at not less than the highest posted price by a major purchaser (as defined in § 226.1(h)) in Osage County, Oklahoma, who purchases production from Osage oil leases.

        (3) Royalty in kind. Should Lessor, with approval of the Secretary, elect to take the royalty in kind, Lessee shall furnish free storage for royalty oil for a period not to exceed 60 days from date of production after notice of such election.

        (b) —(1)  All casinghead gas shall belong to the oil Lessee subject to any rights under existing gas leases. All casinghead gas removed from the lease from which it is produced shall be metered unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent and be subject to a royalty of not less than 162/3 percent of the market value of the gas and all products extracted therefrom, less a reasonable allowance for manufacture or processing. If an oil Lessee supplies casinghead gas produced from one lease for operation and/or development of other leases, either his/hers or others, a royalty of not less than 162/3 percent shall be paid on the market value of all casinghead gas so used. All casinghead gas not utilized by the oil Lessee may, with the approval of the Superintendent, be utilized or sold by the gas Lessee, subject to the prescribed royalty of not less than 162/3 percent of the market value.

        (2)  Lessee shall pay a royalty of not less than 162/3 percent of the market value of all natural gas and products extracted therefrom produced and sold from his lease. Natural gas used in the reasonable and prudent operation and development of said lease shall be exempted from royalty payment.

        (3)  Lessee shall pay royalty as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (c)  In no event shall the royalty paid from producing leases during any year be less than an amount equal to the annual rental specified for the lease. Any underpayment of minimum royalty shall be due and payable within 45 days following the end of the lease year. After the primary term, Lessee shall submit with his payment evidence that the lease is producing in paying quantities. The Superintendent is authorized to determine whether the lease is actually producing in paying quantities or has terminated for lack of such production. Payment for any underpayment not made within the time specified shall be subject to a late charge at the rate of not less than 11/2 percent per month for each month or fraction thereof until paid.

        § 226.12   Government reserves right to purchase oil.

#### § § 226.12

        Any of the executive departments of the U.S. Government shall have the option to purchase all or any part of the oil produced from any lease at not less than the highest posted price as defined in § 226.11.

        § 226.13   Time of royalty payments and reports.

#### § § 226.13

        (a) Royalty payments due may be paid by either purchaser or Lessee. Unless otherwise provided by the Osage Tribal Council and approved by the Superintendent, all payments shall be due by the 25th day of each month and shall cover the sales of the preceding month. Failure to make such payments shall subject Lessee or purchaser, whoever is responsible for royalty payment, to a late charge at the rate of not less than 11/2 percent for each month or fraction thereof until paid. The Osage Tribal Council, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, may waive the late charges.

        (b) Lessee shall furnish certified monthly reports by the 25th of each following month covering all operations, whether there has been production or not, indicating therein the total amount of oil, natural gas, casinghead gas, and other products subject to royalty payment.

        (c) Failure to remit payments or reports shall subject Lessee to further penalties as provided in §§ 226.42 and 226.43 and shall subject the division order to cancellation.

        § 226.14   Contracts and division orders.

#### § § 226.14

        (a) Lessee may enter into division orders or contracts with the purchasers of oil, gas, or derivatives therefrom which will provide for the purchaser to make payment of royalty in accordance with his lease:  That such division orders or contracts shall not relieve Lessee from responsibility for the payment of the royalty should the purchaser fail to pay. No production shall be removed from the leased premises until a division order and/or contract and its terms are approved by the Superintendent:  That the Superintendent may grant temporary permission to run oil or gas from a lease pending the approval of a division order or contract. Lessee shall file a certified monthly report and pay royalty on the value of all oil and gas used off the premises for development and operating purposes. Lessee shall be responsible for the correct measurement and reporting of all oil and/or gas taken from the leased premises.

        (b) Lessee shall require the purchaser of oil and/or gas from his/her lease or leases to furnish the Superintendent, no later than the 25th day of each month, a statement reporting the gross barrels of oil and/or gross Mcf of gas sold during the preceding month. The Superintendent may authorize an extension of time, not to exceed 10 days, for furnishing this statement.

        § 226.15   Unit leases, assignments and related instruments.

#### § § 226.15

        (a)  The Osage Tribal Council and Lessee or Lessees, may, with the approval of the Superintendent, unitize or merge, two or more oil or oil and gas leases into a unit or cooperative operating plan to promote the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas from a common source of supply or portion thereof embracing the lands covered by such lease or leases. The cooperative or unit agreement shall be subject to the regulations in this part and applicable laws governing the leasing of the Osage Mineral Estate. Any agreement between the parties in interest to terminate a unit or cooperative agreement as to all or any portion of the lands included shall be submitted to the Superintendent for his approval. Upon approval the leases included thereunder shall be restored to their original terms:  That for the purpose of preventing waste and to promote the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas from a common source of supply or portion thereof, all oil leases, oil and gas leases, and gas leases issued heretofore and hereafter under the provisions of the regulations in this part shall be subject to any unit development plan affecting the leased lands that may be required by the Superintendent with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council, and which plan shall adequately protect the rights of all parties in interest including the Osage Mineral Estate.

        (b)  Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Superintendent. The assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. Lessee must assign either his entire interest in a lease or legal subdivision thereof, or an undivided interest in the whole lease:  That when an assignment covers only a portion of a lease or covers interests in separate horizons such assignment shall be subject to both the consent of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent. If a lease is divided by the assignment of an entire interest in any part, each part shall be considered a separate lease and the assignee shall be bound to comply with all the terms and conditions of the original lease. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed with the Superintendent within 30 days after the date of execution by all parties. If requested within the 30-day period, the Superintendent may grant an extension of 15 days. A filing fee of $10 shall accompany each assignment.

        (c)  Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production shall not be considered as an interest in a lease as such term is used in paragraph (b) of this section. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production are hereby authorized and the approval of the Department of the Interior or any agency thereof shall not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be subject to the condition that nothing in any such agreement shall be construed as modifying any of the obligations of Lessee under his lease and the regulations in this part. All such obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free of any such royalties or payments. The existence of agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered in justifying the shutdown or abandonment of any well. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production need not be filed with the Superintendent unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. An agreement creating overriding royalties or payment out of production shall be suspended when the working interest income per active producing well is equal to or less than the operational cost of the well, as determined by the Superintendent.

        (d)  The Superintendent is authorized to approve drilling contracts with a stipulation that such approval does not in any way bind the Department to approve subsequent assignments that may be provided for in said contracts. Approval merely authorizes entry on the lease for the purpose of development work.

        (e)  The lessee owning both an oil lease and gas lease covering the same acreage is authorized to convert such leases to a combination oil and gas lease.

      Operations

        § 226.16   Commencement of operations.

#### § § 226.16

        (a) No operations shall be permitted upon any tract of land until a lease covering such tract shall have been approved by the Superintendent:  That the Superintendent may grant authority to any party under such rules, consistent with the regulations in this part that he deems proper, to conduct geophysical and geological exploration work.

        (b) Lessee shall submit applications on forms to be furnished by the Superintendent and secure his approval before:

        (1) Well drilling, treating, or workover operations are started on the leased premises.

        (2) Removing casing from any well.

        (c) Lessee shall notify the Superintendent a reasonable time in advance of starting work, of intention to drill, redrill, deepen, plug, or abandon a well.

        § 226.17   How to acquire permission to begin operations on a restricted homestead allotment.

#### § § 226.17

        (a) Lessee may conduct operations within or upon a restricted homestead selection only with the written consent of the Superintendent.

        (b) If the allottee is unwilling to permit operations on his homestead, the Superintendent will cause an examination of the premises to be made with the allottee and lessee or his representative. Upon finding that the interests of the Osage Tribe require that the tract be developed, the Superintendent will endeavor to have the parties agree upon the terms under which operations on the homestead may be conducted.

        (c) In the event the allottee and lessee cannot reach an agreement, the matter shall be presented by all parties before the Osage Tribal Council, and the Council shall make its recommendations. Such recommendations shall be considered as final and binding upon the allottee and lessee. A guardian may represent the allottee. Where no one is authorized or where no person is deemed by the Superintendent to be a proper party to speak for a person of unsound mind or feeble understanding, the Principal Chief of the Osage Tribe shall represent him.

        (d) If the allottee or his representative does not appear before the Osage Tribal Council when notified by the Superintendent, or if the Council fails to act within 10 days after the matter is referred to it, the Superintendent may authorize lessee to proceed with operations in conformity with the provisions of his lease and the regulations in this part.

        § 226.18   Information to be given surface owners prior to commencement of drilling operations.

#### § § 226.18

        Except for the surveying and staking of a well, no operations of any kind shall commence until the lessee or his/her authorized representative shall meet with the surface owner or his/her representative, if a resident of and present in Osage County, Oklahoma. Unless waived by the Superintendent or otherwise agreed to between the lessee and surface owner, such meeting shall be held at least 10 days prior to the commencement or any operations, except for the surveying and staking of the well. At such meeting lessee or his/her authorized representative shall comply with the following requirements:

        (a) Indicate the location of the well or wells to be drilled.

        (b) Arrange for route of ingress and egress. Upon failure to agree on route ingress and egress, said route shall be set by the Superintendent.

        (c) Impart to said surface owners the name and address of the party or representative upon whom the surface owner shall serve any claim for damages which he may sustain from mineral development or operations, and as to the procedure for settlement thereof as provided in § 226.21.

        (d) Where the drilling is to be on restricted land, lessee or his authorized representative in the manner provided above shall meet with the Superintendent.

        (e) When the surface owner or his/her representative is not a resident of, or is not physically present in, Osage County, Oklahoma, or cannot be contacted at the last known address, the Superintendent may authorize lessee to proceed with operations.

        § 226.19   Use of surface of land.

#### § § 226.19

        (a) Lessee or his/her authorized representative shall have the right to use so much of the surface of the land within the Osage Mineral Estate as may be reasonable for operations and marketing. This includes but is not limited to the right to lay and maintain pipelines, electric lines, pull rods, other appliances necessary for operations and marketing, and the right-of-way for ingress and egress to any point of operations. If Lessee and surface owner are unable to agree as to the routing of pipelines, electric lines, etc., said routing shall be set by the Superintendent. The right to use water for lease operations is established by § 226.24. Lessee shall conduct his/her operations in a workmanlike manner, commit no waste and allow none to be committed upon the land, nor permit any unavoidable nuisance to be maintained on the premises under his/her control.

        (b) Before commencing a drilling operation, Lessee shall pay or tender to the surface owner commencement money in the amount of $25 per seismic shot hole and commencement money in the amount of $300 for each well, after which Lessee shall be entitled to immediate possession of the drilling site. Commencement money will not be required for the redrilling of a well which was originally drilled under the currently lease. A drilling site shall be held to the minimum area essential for operations and shall not exceed one and one-half acres in area unless authorized by the Superintendent. Commencement money shall be a credit toward the settlement of the total damages. Acceptance of commencement money by the surface owner does not affect his/her right to compensation for damages as described in § 226.20, occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which it was paid. Since actual damage to the surface from operations cannot necessarily be ascertained prior to the completion of a well as a serviceable well or dry hole, a damage settlement covering the drilling operation need not be made until after completion of drilling operations.

        (c) Where the surface is restricted land, commencement money shall be paid to the Superintendent for the landowner. All other surface owners shall be paid or tendered such commencement money direct. Where such surface owners are not residents of Osage County nor have a representative located therein, such payment shall be made or tendered to the last known address of the surface owner at least 5 days before commencing drilling operation on any well:  That should lessee be unable to reach the owner of the surface of the land for the purpose of tendering the commencement money or if the owner of the surface of the land shall refuse to accept the same, lessee shall deposit such amount with the Superintendent by check payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The superintendent shall thereupon advise the owner of the surface of the land by mail at his last known address that the commencement money is being held for payment to him upon his written request.

        (d) Lessee shall also pay fees for tank sites not exceeding 50 feet square at the rate of $100 per tank site or other vessel:  That no payment shall be due for a tank temporarily set on a well location site for drilling, completing, or testing. The sum to be paid for a tank occupying more than 50 feet square shall be agreed upon between the surface owner and lessee or, on failure to agree, the same shall be determined by arbitration as provided by § 226.21.

        § 226.20   Settlement of damages claimed.

#### § § 226.20

        (a) Lessee or his authorized representative or geophysical permittee shall pay for all damages to growing crops, any improvements on the lands, and all other surface damages as may be occasioned by operations. Commencement money shall be a credit toward the settlement of the total damages occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which it was paid. Such damages shall be paid to the owner of the surface and by him apportioned among the parties interested in the surface, whether as owner, surface lessee, or otherwise, as the parties may mutually agree or as their interests may appear. If lessee or his authorized representative and surface owner are unable to agree concerning damages, the same shall be determined by arbitration. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to deny any party the right to file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction if he is dissatisfied with the amount of the award.

        (b) Surface owners shall notify their lessees or tenants of the regulations in this part and of the necessary procedure to follow in all cases of alleged damages. If so authorized in writing, surface lessees or tenants may represent the surface owners.

        (c) In settlement of damages on restricted land all sums due and payable shall be paid to the Superintendent for credit to the account of the Indian entitled thereto. The Superintendent will make the apportionment between the Indian landowner or owners and surface Lessee of record.

        (d) Any person claiming an interest in any leased tract or in damages thereto, must furnish to the Superintendent a statement in writing showing said claimed interest. Failure to furnish such statement shall constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming any part of such damages after the same shall have been disbursed.

        § 226.21   Procedure for settlement of damages claimed.

#### § § 226.21

        Where the surface owner or his lessee suffers damage due to the oil and gas operations and/or marketing of oil or gas by lessee or his authorized representative, the procedure for recovery shall be as follows:

        (a) The party or parties aggrieved shall, as soon as possible after the discovery of any damages, serve written notice to Lessee or his authorized representative as provided by § 226.18. Written notice shall contain the nature and location of the alleged damages, the date of occurrence, the names of the party or parties causing said damages, and the amount of damages. It is not intended by this requirement to limit the time within which action may be brought in the courts to less than the 90-day period allowed by section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1929 (45 Stat. 1478, 1479).

        (b) If the alleged damages are not adjusted at the time of such notice, Lessee or his authorized representative shall try to adjust the claim with the party or parties aggrieved within 20 days from receipt of the notice. If the claimant is the owner of restricted property and a settlement results, a copy of the settlement agreement shall be filed with the Superintendent. If the settlement agreement is approved by the Superintendent, payment shall be made to the Superintendent for the benefit of said claimant.

        (c) If the parties fail to adjust the claim within the 20 days specified, then within 10 days thereafter each of the interested parties shall appoint an arbitrator who immediately upon their appointment shall agree upon a third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators shall fail to agree upon a third arbitrator within 10 days, they shall immediately notify the parties in interest. If said parties cannot agree upon a third arbitrator within 5 days after receipt of such notice, the Superintendent shall appoint the third arbitrator.

        (d) As soon as the third arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrators shall meet; hear the evidence and arguments of the parties; and examine the lands, crops, improvements, or other property alleged to have been injured. Within 10 days they shall render their decision as to the amount of the damage due. The arbitrators shall be disinterested persons. The fees and expenses of the third arbitrator shall be borne equally by the claimant and Lessee or his authorized representative. Each Lessee or his authorized representative and claimant shall pay the fee and expenses for the arbitrator appointed by him.

        (e) When an act of an oil or gas lessee or his authorized representative results in injury to both the surface owner and his lessee, the parties aggrieved shall join in the appointment of an arbitrator. Where the injury complained of is chargeable to one or more oil or gas Lessee, or his authorized representative, such lessee or said representative shall join in the appointment of an arbitrator.

        (f) Any two of the arbitrators may make a decision as to the amount of damage due. The decision shall be in writing and shall be served forthwith upon the parties in interest. Each party shall have 90 days from the date the decision is served in which to file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. If no such action is filed within said time and the award is against Lessee or his/her authorized representative, he/she shall pay the same, together with interest at an annual rate established for the Internal Revenue Service from date of award, within 10 days after the expiration of said period for filing an action.

        (g) Lessee or his authorized representative shall file with the Superintendent a report on each settlement agreement, setting out the nature and location of the damage, date, and amount of the settlement, and any other pertinent information.

        § 226.22   Prohibition of pollution.

#### § § 226.22

        (a) All operators, contractors, drillers, service companies, pipe pulling and salvaging contractors, or other persons, shall at all times conduct their operations and drill, equip, operate, produce, plug and abandon all wells drilled for oil or gas, service wells or exploratory wells (including seismic, core and stratigraphic holes) in a manner that will prevent pollution and the migration of oil, gas, salt water or other substance from one stratum into another, including any fresh water bearing formation.

        (b) Pits for drilling mud or deleterious substance used in the drilling, completion, recompletion, or workover of any well shall be constructed and maintained to prevent pollution of surface and subsurface fresh water. These pits shall be enclosed with a fence of at least four strands of barbed wire, or an approved substitute, stretched taut to adequately braced corner posts, unless the surface owner, user, or the Superintendent gives consent to the contrary. Immediately after completion of operations, pits shall be emptied and leveled unless otherwise requested by surface owner or user.

        (c) Drilling pits shall be adequate to contain mud and other material extracted from wells and shall have adequate storage to maintain a supply of mud for use in emergencies.

        (d) No earthen pit, except those used in the drilling, completion, recompletion or workover of a well, shall be constructed, enlarged, reconstructed or used without approval of the Superintendent. Unlined earthen pits shall not be used for the continued storage of salt water or other deleterious substances.

        (e) Deleterious fluids other than fresh water drilling fluids used in drilling or workover operations, which are displaced or produced in well completion or stimulation procedures, including but not limited to fracturing, acidizing, swabbing, and drill stem tests, shall be collected into a pit lined with plastic of at least 30 mil or a metal tank and maintained separately from above-mentioned drilling fluids to allow for separate disposal.

        § 226.23   Easements for wells off leased premises.

#### § § 226.23

        The Superintendent, with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council, may grant commercial and noncommercial easements for wells off the leased premises to be used for purposes associated with oil and gas production. Rental payable to the Osage Tribe for such easements shall be an amount agreed to by Grantee and the Osage Tribal Council subject to the approval of the Superintendent. Grantee shall be responsible for all damages resulting from the use of such wells and settlement therefor shall be made as provided in § 226.21.

        § 226.24   Lessee's use of water.

#### § § 226.24

        Lessee or his contractor may, with the approval of the Superintendent, use water from streams and natural water courses to the extent that same does not diminish the supply below the requirements of the surface owner from whose land the water is taken. Similarly, Lessee or his contractor may use water from reservoirs formed by the impoundment of water from such streams and natural water courses, provided such use does not exceed the quantity to which they originally would have been entitled had the reservoirs not been constructed. Lessee or his contractor may install necessary lines and other equipment within the Osage Mineral Estate to obtain such water. Any damage resulting from such installation shall be settled as provided in § 226.21.

        § 226.25   Gas well drilled by oil lessees and vice versa.

#### § § 226.25

        Prior to drilling, the oil or gas lessee shall notify the other lessees of his/her intent to drill. When an oil lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation or zone having indications of possible gas production, or the gas lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation or zone having indication of possible oil production, he/she shall immediately notify the other lessee and the Superintendent. Lessee drilling the well shall obtain all information which a prudent operator utilizes to evaluate the productive capability of such formation or zone.

        (a)  If the oil lessee drills a gas well, he/she shall, without removing from the well any of the casing or other equipment, immediately shut the well in and notify the gas lessee and the Superintendent. If the gas lessee does not, within 45 days after receiving notice and cost of drilling, elect to take over such well and reimburse the oil lessee the cost of drilling, including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and other equipment, the oil lessee shall immediately confine the gas to the original stratum. The disposition of such well and the production therefrom shall then be subject to the approval of the Superintendent. In the event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, such cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by the Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well shall be plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.

        (b) Oil well to be turned over to oil lessee. If the gas lessee drills an oil well, he/she must immediately, without removing from the well any of the casing or other equipment, notify the oil lessee and the superintendent.

        (1) If the oil lessee does not, within 45 days after receipt of notice and cost of drilling, elect to take over the well, he/she must immediately notify the gas lessee. From that point, the superintendent must approve the disposition of the well, and any gas produced from it.

        (2) If the oil lessee chooses to take over the well, he/she must pay to the gas lessee:

        (i) The cost of drilling the well, including all damages paid; and

        (ii) The cost in place of casing and other equipment.

        (3) If the oil lessee and the gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, the superintendent will apportion the cost between the oil and gas lessees. If the lessees do not accept the apportionment, the oil or gas lessee who drilled the well must plug the well.

        (c)  If the gas lessee shall drill an oil well upon lands not leased for oil purposes or vice versa, the Superintendent may, until such time as said lands are leased, permit the lessee who drilled the well to operate and market the production therefrom. When said lands are leased, the lessee who drilled and completed the well shall be reimbursed by the oil or gas lessee, for the cost of drilling said well, including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and other equipment. If the lessee does not elect to take over said well as provided above, the disposition of such well and the production therefrom shall be determined by the Superintendent. In the event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, such cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by the Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well shall be plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.

        § 226.26   Determining cost of well.

#### § § 226.26

        The term “cost of drilling” as applied where one lessee takes over a well drilled by another, shall include all reasonable, usual, necessary, and proper expenditures. A list of expenses mentioned in this section shall be presented to proposed purchasing lessee within 10 days after the completion of the well. In the event of a disagreement between the parties as to the charges assessed against the well that is to be taken over, such charges shall be determined by the Superintendent.

        § 226.27   Gas for operating purposes and tribal use.

#### § § 226.27

        (a)  Lessee of a producing gas lease shall furnish the oil lessee sufficient gas for operating purposes at a rate to be agreed upon, or on failure to agree the rate shall be determined by the Superintendent:  That the oil lessee shall at his own expense and risk, furnish and install the necessary connections to the gas lessee's well or pipeline. All such connections shall be reported in writing to the Superintendent.

        (b)  (1) Gas from any well or wells shall be furnished any Tribal-owned building or enterprise at a rate not to exceed the price less royalty being received or offered by a gas purchaser:  That such requirement shall be subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the rate to be paid by the Osage Tribe shall be determined by the Superintendent based on prices being paid by purchasers in the Osage Mineral Estate. The Osage Tribe is to furnish all necessary material and labor for such connection with Lessee's gas system. The use of such gas shall be at the risk of the Osage Tribe at all times.

        (2) Any member of the Osage Tribe residing in Osage County and outside a corporate city is entitled to the use at his own expense of not to exceed 400,000 cubic feet of gas per calendar year for his principal residence at a rate not to exceed the amount paid by a gas purchaser plus 10 percent:  That such requirement shall be subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the amount to be paid by the Tribal member shall be determined by the Superintendent. Gas to Tribal members is not royalty free. The Tribal member is to furnish all necessary material and labor for such connection to Lessee's gas system, and shall maintain his own lines. The use of such gas shall be at the risk of the Tribal member at all times.

        (3) Gas furnished by Lessee under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be terminated only with the approval of the Superintendent. Written application for termination must be made to the Superintendent showing justification.

      Cessation of Operations

        § 226.28   Shutdown, abandonment, and plugging of wells.

#### § § 226.28

        No productive well shall be abandoned until its lack for further profitable production of oil and/or gas has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent. Lessee shall not shut down, abandon, or otherwise discontinue the operation or use of any well for any purpose without the written approval of the Superintendent. All applications for such approval shall be submitted to the Superintendent on forms furnished by him/her.

        (a) Application for authority to permanently shut down or discontinue use or operation of a well shall set forth justification, probable duration the means by which the well bore is to be protected, and the contemplated eventual disposition of the well. The method of conditioning such well shall be subject to the approval of the Superintendent.

        (b) Prior to permanent abandonment of any well, the oil lessee or the gas lessee, as the case may be, shall offer the well to the other for his recompletion or use under such terms as may be mutually agreed upon but not in conflict with the regulations. Failure of the Lessee receiving the offer to reply within 10 days after receipt thereof shall be deemed as rejection of the offer. If, after indicating acceptance, the two parties cannot agree on the terms of the offer within 30 days, the disposition of such well shall be determined by the Superintendent.

        (c) The Superintendent is authorized to shut in a lease when the lessee fails to comply with the terms of the lease, the regulations, and/or orders of the Superintendent.

        § 226.29   Disposition of casings and other improvements.

#### § § 226.29

        (a) Upon termination of lease, permanent improvements, unless otherwise provided by written agreement with the surface owner and filed with the Superintendent, shall remain a part of said land and become the property of the surface owner upon termination of the lease, other than by cancellation. Exceptions include personal property not limited to tools, tanks, pipelines, pumping and drilling equipment, derricks, engines, machinery, tubing, and the casings of all wells: Provided, That when any lease terminates, all such personal property shall be removed the word “terminates”; and in the last sentence of the paragraph, within 90 days or such reasonable extension of time as may be granted by the Superintendent. Otherwise, the ownership of all casings shall revert to Lessor and all other personal property and permanent improvements to the surface owner. Nothing herein shall be construed to relieve lessee of responsibility for removing any such personal property or permanent improvements from the premises if required by the Superintendent and restoring the premises as nearly as practicable to the original state.

        (b) Upon cancellation of lease. When there has been a cancellation for cause, Lessor shall be entitled and authorized to take immediate possession of the lease premises and all permanent improvements and all other equipment necessary for the operation of the lease.

        (c) Wells to be abandoned shall be promptly plugged as prescribed by the Superintendent. Applications to plug shall include a statement affirming compliance with § 226.28(b) and shall set forth reasons for plugging, a detailed statement of the proposed work including kind, location, and length of plugs (by depth), plans for mudding and cementing, testing, parting and removing casing, and any other pertinent information:  That the Superintendent may give oral permission and instructions pending receipt of a written application to plug a newly drilled hole. Lessee shall remit a fee of $15 with each written application for authority to plug a well. This fee will be refunded if permission is not granted.

        (d) Lessee shall plug and fill all dry or abandoned wells in a manner to confine the fluid in each formation bearing fresh water, oil, gas, salt water, and other minerals, and to protect it against invasion of fluids from other sources. Mud-laden fluid, cement, and other plugs shall be used to fill the hole from bottom to top:  That if a satisfactory agreement is reached between Lessee and the surface owner, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, Lessee may condition the well for use as a fresh water well and shall so indicate on the plugging record. The manner in which plugging material shall be introduced and the type of material so used shall be subject to the approval of the Superintendent. Within 10 days after plugging, Lessee shall file with the Superintendent a complete report of the plugging of each well. When any well is plugged and abandoned, Lessee shall, within 90 days, clean up the premises around such well to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.

        (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, after being authorized by the Joint Business Council of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes or its authorized representative, the superintendent shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the sale, unless a shorter period is authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, each of which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to the highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall file with the superintendent the lease in completed form. The superintendent may for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be forfeited for the use and benefit of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes.

        (b) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease, or if the Secretary of the Interior shall determine that it is unwise in the interests of the Indians to accept the highest bid, the Secretary may readvertise such lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, with the consent of the tribal council or other governing tribal authorities, a lease may be made by private negotiations. The successful bidder or bidders will be required to pay his or their share of the advertising costs. Amounts received from unsuccessful bidders will be returned; but when no bid is accepted on a tract, the costs of advertising will be assessed against the applicant who requested that said tract be advertised.

Payments of rentals and royalties except the first year's rental, which shall be paid to the superintendent as prescribed in § 227.4 shall be transmitted to the superintendent through the supervisor. All such payments shall be accompanied by a statement, in triplicate, by the lessee, showing the specific items of royalty or rental that the remittance is intended to cover, and payment of royalties on production shall be made not later than the last day of the calendar month following the production for which such payment is to be made.

        § 227.16   Crediting advance annual payments.

#### § § 227.16

        In the event of discovery of minerals in paying quantities all advance rents and advance royalties shall be allowed as credit on stipulated royalties as they accrue for the year for which such advance payments have been made. No refund of any such advance payment made under any lease will be allowed in the event the royalty on production for the year is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; nor will any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee because of any subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.

        § 227.17   Rates of rents and royalties.

#### § § 227.17

        (a) The lessee shall pay, beginning with the date of execution of leases by the Secretary of the Interior, a rental of $1.25 per acre per annum in advance during the continuance thereof, together with a royalty of 12  percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and saved from the land leased, save and except oil and/or gas used by the lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease, which oil or gas shall be royalty free. A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of supervision, “value” for the purposes of the lease may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be calculated on the basis of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil by causes beyond his control.

        (b) The proceeds from all leases shall be taken up in the accounts of the superintendent for appropriate deposit for the benefit of the Indians.

        § 227.18   Free use of gas by lessor.

#### § § 227.18

        If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's risk at all times.

        § 227.19   Division orders.

#### § § 227.19

        (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil for the payment of the royalties on production to the superintendent by such purchasers, but such arrangements, if made, shall not operate to relieve a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay such royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this privilege, division orders permitting the pipeline companies or other purchasers of the oil to withhold the royalty interest shall be executed and forwarded to the supervisor for approval, as pipeline companies are not permitted to accept or run oil from leased Indian lands until after the approval of a division order showing that the lessee has a lease regularly approved and in effect. When the lessee company runs its own oil, it shall execute an intracompany division order and forward it to the supervisor for his consideration. The right is reserved for the supervisor to cancel a division order at any time or require the pipeline company to discontinue to run the oil of any lessee who fails to operate the lease properly or otherwise violates the provisions of the lease, of the regulations in this part, or of the operating regulations.

        (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gaged and records are made of the temperature, gravity and impurities. The lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which except lowest gage, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the pipeline. Failure of the lessee to perform properly these duties will subject the division order to revocation.

      Operations

        § 227.20   Permission to start operations.

#### § § 227.20

        (a) No operations will be permitted on any lease before it is executed by the Secretary of the Interior.

        (b) Written permission must be secured from the supervisor or his representative before any operations are started on the leased premises. After such permission is secured the operations must be in accordance with the operating regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior. Copies of the regulations in this part may be secured from either the supervisor or the superintendent, and no operations should be attempted without a study of the operating regulations.

      (b) In the event of the death of an owner of Alaskan reindeer, any direct or indirect interest by descent or devise shall be determined by the Department of Interior in a proceeding conducted in accordance with the provisions of 43 CFR part 4, subpart D. During the pendency of such a proceeding, the authority to assume control over the affected Alaskan reindeer pursuant to 43 CFR 4.270 may be exercised by the Alaska Regional Director or his designee.

      (c) This paragraph applies if the final probate decree of the Department of the Interior, or the decision of any reviewing Federal court, identifies a non-Native as inheriting Alaskan reindeer.

      § 243.10   How does the Paperwork Reduction Act affect this rule?

#### § § 243.10

      The actions in this rule that are covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act are cleared under OMB Control Number 1076-0047. The parts subject to this control number are 243.4(d), 243.4(e), 243.5(c), 243.7, and 243.9(c). Please note, a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

#### § § 243.11

      All transfers of live Alaskan reindeer or reindeer products that were completed before the effective date of this part are hereby ratified and confirmed. This ratification does not extend to transfers that:

      (a) Were fraudulent;

      (b) Were made under duress;

      (c) Did not result in payment of fair compensation to the Native transferer; or

      (d) Would have been prohibited under §§ 243.6 or 243.8 of this part.

      § 243.12   Are Alaska reindeer trust assets maintained by the U.S. Government for the benefit of Alaska Natives?

      Only the titles to Alaskan reindeer retained for research projects, or possessed by non-Natives under Special Use Permits for Public Display, or the titles to any Alaskan reindeer which may be acquired by the Government in the future for purposes of reestablishing a reindeer loan program, are held by the United States in trust for Alaska Natives. Other Alaskan reindeer are the private property of the Alaska Native owners. However, a trust responsibility continues to exist with respect to all Alaskan reindeer, insofar as the Government remains responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Reindeer Act and these regulations, including the provisions requiring approval of transfers to non-Natives, and providing for the determination of inheritance.

      § 243.13   Who may appeal an action under this part?

#### § § 243.13

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 249.1   Purpose.

#### § § 249.1

        (a) The purposes of these regulations (part 249) are:

        (1) To assist in protecting the off-reservation nonexclusive fishing rights which are secured to certain Indian tribes by their treaties with the United States;

        (2) To promote the proper management, conservation and protection of fisheries resources which are subject to such treaties of the United States;

        (3) To provide for determination of restrictions on the manner of exercising nonexclusive fishing privileges under rights secured to Indian tribes by such treaties of the United States necessary for conservation of the fisheries resources;

        (4) To assist in the orderly administration of Indian Affairs;

        (5) To encourage consultation and cooperation between the states and Indian tribes in the management and improvement of fisheries resources affected by such treaties;

        (6) To assist the states in enforcing their laws and regulations for the management and conservation of fisheries resources in a manner compatible with the treaties of the United States which are applicable to such resources.

        (b) The conservation regulations of this part 249 are found to be necessary to assure that the nonexclusive rights secured to certain Indian tribes by treaties of the United States to fish at usual and accustomed places outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation shall be protected and preserved for the benefit of present and future members of such tribes in a manner consistent with the nonexclusive character of such rights. Any exercise of an Indian off-reservation treaty fishing right shall be in accordance with this part and any applicable area regulations issued hereunder.

        § 249.2   Area regulations.

#### § § 249.2

        (a) The Secretary of the Interior may upon request of an Indian tribe, request of a State Governor, or upon his own motion, and upon finding that Federal regulation of Indian fishing in any waters in which Indians have a treaty-secured nonexclusive fishing right is necessary to assure the conservation and wise utilization of the fishery resources for the present and future use and enjoyment of the Indians and other persons entitled thereto, promulgate regulations to govern the exercise of such treaty-secured fishing right in such waters for the purpose of preventing, in conjunction with appropriate State conservation laws and regulations governing fishing by persons not fishing under treaty rights, the deterioration of the fishery resources.

        (b) In formulating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior may incorporate such State laws or regulations, or such tribal regulations as have been approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, as he finds to be consistent with the Indians' rights under the Treaty and the conservation of the fishery resources.

        (c) Before promulgating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior will seek the views of the affected Indian tribes, of the fish or game management agency or agencies of any affected State, and of other interested persons. Except in emergencies where the Secretary finds that the exigencies require the promulgation of regulations to be effective immediately, a notice of proposed rule making will be published in the  in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 to afford an opportunity to submit comments and information, at such times and in such manner as may be specified in the notice. In the event of the emergency promulgation of regulations, interested persons will be afforded, as soon as possible, an opportunity to request amendment or revocation thereof.

        (d) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section shall contain provisions for invoking emergency closures or restrictions or the relaxation thereof at the field level when necessary or appropriate to meet conditions not foreseeable at the time the regulations were issued.

        (e) Regulations issued pursuant to this § 249.2 may include such requirements for recording and reporting catch statistics as the appropriate state fish and game agencies or the Secretary of the Interior deem necessary for effective fishery management.

        § 249.3   Identification cards.

#### § § 249.3

        (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall arrange for the issuance of an appropriate identification card to any Indian entitled thereto as prima facie evidence that the authorized holder thereof is entitled to exercise the fishing rights secured by the treaty designated thereon. The Commissioner may cause a federal card to be issued for this purpose or may authorize the issuance of cards by proper tribal authorities:  That any such tribal cards shall be countersigned by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs certifying that the person named on the card is a member of the tribe issuing such card and that said tribe is recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as having fishing rights under the treaty specified on such card. Copies of the form of any identification card authorized pursuant to this section and a list of the authorized Bureau of Indian Affairs issuing or countersigning officials shall be furnished to the fisheries management and enforcement agencies of any State in which such fishing rights may be exercised.

        (b) No such card shall be issued to any Indian who is not on the official membership roll of the tribe which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior.  That until further notice, a temporary card may be issued to any member of a tribe not having an approved current membership roll who submits evidence of his/her entitlement thereto satisfactory to the issuing officer and, in the case of a tribally issued card, to the countersigning officer. Any Indian claiming to have been wrongfully denied a card may appeal the decision in accordance with part 2 of this chapter.

        (c) No person shall be issued an identification card on the basis of membership in more than one tribe at any one time.

        (d) Each card shall state the name, address, tribal affiliation and enrollment number (if any) of the holder, identify the treaty under which the holder is entitled to fishing rights, contain such additional personal identification data as is required on fishing licenses issued under the law of the State or States within which it is used, and be signed by the issuing officer and by the holder.

        (e) No charge or fee of any kind shall be imposed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the issuance of an identification card hereunder:  That this shall not prevent any Indian tribe from imposing any fee or tax which it may otherwise be authorized to impose upon the exercise of any tribal fishing right.

        (f) All cards issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to this part 249 shall be and remain the property of the United States and may be retaken by any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer from any unauthorized holder. Any card so retaken shall be immediately forwarded to the officer who issued it.

        (g) The failure of any person who claims to be entitled to the benefits of a treaty fishing right to have such a card in his immediate personal possession while fishing or engaging in other activity in the claimed exercise of such right to display it upon request to any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer shall be prima facie evidence that the person is not entitled to exercise an Indian fishing right under a treaty of the United States.

        (h) No person shall allow any use of his identification card by any other person.

In the absence of proof to the contrary, any fishing gear which is not so marked or labeled shall be presumed not to be used in the exercise of an off-reservation treaty fishing right and shall be subject to control or seizure under State law.

        § 249.5   Use of unauthorized helpers or agents.

#### § § 249.5

        No Indian shall, while exercising off-reservations treaty-secured fishing rights, permit any person 12 years of age or older other than the authorized holder of a currently valid identification card issued pursuant to this part 249 to fish for him, assist him in fishing, or use any gear of fishing location identified as his gear or location pursuant to this part 249.

        § 249.6   Enforcement and penalties.

#### § § 249.6

        (a) Any Indian tribe with a tribal court may confer jurisdiction upon such court to punish violations by its members of this part 249 or of the area regulations issued pursuant thereto. Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon each Court of Indian Offenses established pursuant to part 11 of this chapter to punish such violations by members of tribes whose reservations are under the jurisdiction of such court. Courts of Indian Fishing Offenses may be created pursuant to part 11 of this chapter to punish such violations by members of any tribe or group of tribes for which there is otherwise no Court of Indian Offenses or tribal court with jurisdiction to enforce this part 249. The provisions of part 11 of this chapter shall apply to any such court with respect to the exercise of its jurisdiction to enforce this part 249. All jurisdiction conferred by this section shall apply without regard to any territorial limitations otherwise applicable to the jurisdiction of such court.

        (b) Acceptance or use of an identification card issued pursuant to this part 249 or use of any fishing gear marked or identified pursuant thereto shall constitute an acknowledgment that the fishing done under such card or with such gear is in the claimed exercise of a tribal fishing right and is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal court, Court of Indian Offenses, or Court of Indian Fishing Offenses. Except as may be otherwise provided by tribal regulations approved by or on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, any person claiming to be exercising such tribal right and fishing in violation of the regulations contained in or issued under this part 249 may be punished by a fine of not to exceed $1,617, imprisonment of not to exceed 6 months, or both, and shall have his tribal fishing privileges suspended for not less than 5 days for any violation of this part 249 or of any area regulation issued pursuant thereto. The court shall impound the fishing rights identification card of any person for the period which the fishing privileges are suspended.

        (b) The servicing housing office will use your completed application to determine if you are eligible for the HIP.

        (1) If you are found ineligible for the program, the servicing housing office will advise you in writing within 45 days of receipt of your completed application.

        (2) If you are found eligible for the program, the servicing housing office will assess your application for need, according to the factors and numeric values shown in the following table.

        (c) The servicing housing office will develop a list of the applications received and considered for the HIP for the current program year. The list will include, at a minimum, all of the following:

        (1) The number of applications received and, of those, the number considered.

        (2) The rank assigned to applicants in order of need, from highest to lowest, in accordance with tribal approval and knowledge of need, based on the total numeric value assigned using the factors in paragraph (b) of this section. (In case of a tie, the family with the lower income per household member will be listed first.)

        (3) The estimated allowable costs of the improvements, renovations, and replacement projects for each applicant and for the entire priority list. This data must identify which applicants will be served based on the amount of available funding, starting with the neediest applicant and continuing until the available funding is depleted.

        (4) A list of the applicants not ranked, with an explanation of why they weren't ranked (such as the reason for ineligibility or the reason for incomplete application).

        (d) The servicing housing office submits to the regional office an annual fiscal year report that includes all of the following:

        (1) Number of eligible applicants;

        (2) Number of applicants who received service;

        (3) Names of applicants who received service; and

        (4) All of the following for each applicant that received service:

        (i) Date of construction start;

        (ii) Date of construction completion;

        (iii) Cost; and

        (iv) HIP category.

      Subpart D—Receiving Assistance

        § 256.15   When will I hear if I have received funding?

#### § § 256.15

        Your servicing housing office will inform you whether you will receive funds in writing within 45 days after it completes the list required by § 256.14(c).

        (a) If funding is available, the office will send you complete information on how to obtain HIP services.

        (b) If funding is not available, the office will send you instructions on how to update your application for funding for the next available program year.

        § 256.16   What if I don't receive funding?

#### § § 256.16

        If you don't receive funding, your servicing housing office will retain and consider your application for 3 more years. During this 4-year period, you must ensure that the information on your application is still accurate and provide an annual written update if any information has changed.

        § 256.17   How long will I have to wait for work on my house?

#### § § 256.17

        How long it takes to do work on your house depends on:

        (a) Your position on the priority list;

        (b) Whether funds are available;

        (c) The type of work to be done;

        (d) The climate and seasonal conditions where your house is located;

        (e) The availability of a contractor; and

        (f) Other unforeseen factors, such as infrastructure availability.

        § 256.18   Who decides what work will be done?

#### § § 256.18

        The servicing housing office will determine what work is to be done on your house or whether your house will be replaced. The servicing housing office also provides the priority list annually to the Indian Health Service if the Indian Health Service is responsible for verifying availability or feasibility of water and wastewater facilities.

        § 256.19   How are work plans prepared?

#### § § 256.19

        (a) First, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing housing office will visit your house to identify what renovation and or replacement will be done under the HIP. The representative will ensure that flood, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and earthquake requirements are met, including the determination that the renovation or replacement is appropriately treated as a categorical exclusion.

        (b) Second, based on the list of renovations or replacement to be done, your servicing housing office will estimate the total cost of renovation to your house. Cost estimates will be based on locally available services and product costs, or other regional-based, industry-recognized cost data, such as that provided by the MEANs or Marshall Swift. If the house is located in Alaska, documented, reasonable, substantiated freight costs, in accordance with Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR 101-40), not to exceed 100 percent of the cost of materials, can be added to the cost of the project.

        (c) Third, your servicing housing office will determine which HIP category the improvements to your house meet, based on the estimated cost of renovation or replacement. If the estimated cost to renovate your house is more than $60,000, your servicing housing office will recommend your house for replacement or refer you to another source for housing. The other source does not have to be for a replacement house; it may be for government-subsidized rental units or other sources for standard housing.

        (d) Fourth, your servicing housing office will develop a detailed, written report, called a scope of work, that identifies what renovation or construction work on your house will be accomplished and how. The scope of work is used to inform potential bidders of what work is to be done. When the work includes new construction, the scope of work will be supplemented with a set of construction plans and specifications. The construction plans must:

        (1) Meet the occupancy and square footage criteria in § 256.10 (d); and

        (2) Provide complete and detailed instructions to the builder.

        § 256.20   How will I find out what work is to be done?

#### § § 256.20

        The servicing housing office will notify you in writing what work is being scheduled under the HIP. You will be requested to approve the scheduled work by signing a copy of the notice and returning it to the servicing housing office. Work will start after you return the signed copy to the servicing housing office.

        § 256.21   Who does the work?

#### § § 256.21

        Your house will be renovated or replaced by either:

        (a) A licensed and bonded independent contractor or construction company; or

        (b) A tribe that operates the HIP under an Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act agreement.

        § 256.22   How are construction contractors or companies selected and paid?

#### § § 256.22

        The servicing housing office must follow Federal procurement or other Bureau-approved tribal procurement policy. Generally, your servicing housing office develops a “bid specification” or statement of work, which identifies the work to be performed. The appropriate contracting office uses the “bid specification” to provide information and invite bids on the project to interested parties. The contracting office selects the winning bidder after technical review of the bids by and written recommendation from the servicing housing office, and after determination that the bidder is qualified and capable of completing the project as advertised.

        (a) Partial payments to independent contractors will not exceed 80 percent of the value of the completed and acceptable work.

        (b) Recommendation for final payment will be made after final inspection and after all provisions of the contract have been met and all work has been completed.

        § 256.23   Do I have to move out while work is done?

#### § § 256.23

        (a) You will be notified by your servicing housing office that you must vacate your house only if:

        (1) It is scheduled for major renovations requiring that all occupants vacate the house for safety reasons; or

        (2) It is scheduled for replacement, which requires demolition of your current house.

        (b) If you are required to vacate the premises during construction, you are responsible for:

        (1) Locating other lodging;

        (2) Paying all costs associated with vacating and living away from the house; and

        (3) Removing all your belongings and furnishings before the scheduled beginning work date.

        § 256.24   How can I be sure that construction work meets minimum standards?

#### § § 256.24

        (a) At various stages of construction, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing housing office or a building inspector will review the work to ensure that it meets construction standards and building codes. Upon completion of each stage, further construction can begin only after the inspection occurs and approval is granted.

        (b) Inspections of construction and renovation will occur, at a minimum, at the following stages:

        (1) Upon completion of inspection footings and foundations;

        (2) Upon completion of inspection rough-in, roughwiring, and plumbing; and

        (3) At final completion.

        § 256.25   How will I find out that the work is done?

#### § § 256.25

        Your servicing housing office will advise you, in writing, that the work has been completed in compliance with the project contract. Also, you will have a final walk-through of the house with a representative of your servicing housing office. You will be requested to verify that you received the notice of completion of the work by signing a copy of the notice and returning it to your servicing housing office.

        § 256.26   Will I need flood insurance?

#### § § 256.26

        You will need flood insurance if your house is located in an area identified as having special flood hazards under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, 87 Stat. 975). Your servicing housing office will advise you.

        § 256.27   Is my Federal government-assisted house eligible for services?

#### § § 256.27

        No. The intention of this program is to assist the neediest of the needy, who have never received services from any other Federal entity.

        § 256.28   I have a mobile home; am I eligible for help?

#### § § 256.28

        Yes. If you meet the eligibility criteria in § 256.6 and funding is available, you can receive any of the HIP services identified in § 256.7. If you request Category B services and your mobile home has exterior walls less than three inches thick, you must be considered for Category C services.

        § 256.29   Can HIP resources be combined with other available resources?

#### § § 256.29

        Yes. HIP resources may be supplemented with other available resources (, in-kind assistance; tribal or housing authority; and any other leveraging mechanism identified in § 256.3(d)) to increase the number of HIP recipients.

        § 256.30   Can I appeal actions taken under this part?

#### § § 256.30

        You may appeal action or inaction by a BIA official, in accordance with 25 CFR part 2.

      (1) The title to which is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of Indian individuals; or

      (2) The title to which is held by Indian individuals, but which cannot be alienated or encumbered by the owner without the approval of the Secretary because of limitations contained in the conveyance instrument pursuant to Federal law or because of a Federal law directly imposing such restrictions.

      § 262.3   Consultation to determine need for a permit.

#### § § 262.3

      (a) Any person, except as provided in the uniform regulations at 43 CFR 7.5(b) through (d), who proposes to excavate or remove archaeological resources on Indian lands or on properties owned or administered by the BIA must first apply for and secure a permit under the Act. Procedures relating thereto are set forth in § 262.5 of this part.

      (b) No permit under the Act, nor any other Federally issued license or authorization, is required for archaeological investigations that do not involve the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on these lands, except for BIA consent on properties that it owns or administers. Notwithstanding, persons other than those covered under 43 CFR 7.5(b) through (d) shall, before engaging in such investigations:

      (1) Write to the head of each tribal government having jurisdiction over the lands where investigations are to be conducted and request that he or she provide, within 30 days, written information on any permit, license or other form of authorization the tribe might require for the work proposed; and

      (2) Provide the BIA Area Director with a copy of the tribe's written response (or a copy of the request to the tribe if 30 days have elapsed without any response) plus a brief but clear written description of the proposed work and obtain his or her written determination as to whether or not a permit under the Act is required. Area Directors shall provide determinations within 10 working days after receiving such documentation.

      § 262.4   Activities by Indian tribes or individuals that require a permit.

#### § § 262.4

      (a) No Indian tribe may, without a permit under the Act, excavate or remove archaeological resources on:

      (1) Lands of another Indian tribe; or

      (2) Lands of Indian individuals, except those on which the law of that tribe regulates such activity.

      (b) No individual Indian may, without a permit under the Act, excavate or remove archaeological resources on any Indian lands (including his or her own) other than those on which the law of the tribe of which he or she is a member regulates such activity.

      (c) No person, as an employee, consultant, advisor or in any other capacity as an agent for any Indian tribe, shall be exempt from the permit requirements of the Act, except in the cases listed below:

      (1) No permit shall be required if a person is a member of the tribe having jurisdiction over the resources in question and the law of that tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on its lands.

      (2) Tribal employees need not submit permit applications to the BIA if:

      (i) The proposed excavation or removal of archaeological resources is within the normal scope of their duties or otherwise carried out by direction of the tribal government;

      (ii) The work is on Indian lands of the tribe or on which the law of that tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological resources;

      (iii) The tribe ensures that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at 43 CFR part 7 have been met by other documented means; and

      (iv) Before beginning the work, the tribe notifies the Area Director about the nature and location of the proposed work and allows 10 working days after mailing a notification or 5 working days after an oral notification (provided this is documented) for the Area Director to respond. The Area Director need only respond when action is required under § 262.7 of this part, and may do so either in writing or, if documented, orally.

      (3) Consultants, advisors, and others serving by contractual agreement as agents for Indian tribes may use the provisions in § 262.5(f) of this part to expedite the process of obtaining a permit.

      (4) Persons serving as agents for Indian tribes as employees or by contractual agreement may abbreviate the consultation required in § 262.3(b) of this part by disregarding the requirement to consult first with the tribe and, provided the communication is documented, by consulting with the Area Director orally. In these cases, the Area Director need only respond when a permit is deemed necessary and may do so either orally or in writing. If a response is not received within 3 working days after an oral description of the proposed work is made or within 7 working days after a written description is mailed to the Area Director, the work may proceed.

      § 262.5   Application for permits.

#### § § 262.5

      (a) Permits from the BIA shall be issued when an applicant meets the requirements set out in 43 CFR 7.8, and may be conditioned, modified, suspended, or revoked by the Area Director. Area Directors may delegate this authority to Agency Superintendents, but only on a permit-by-permit basis and only to those who have adequate professional support available.

      (b) Prospective applicants may obtain details on how to apply for a permit by contacting the Area Director, at BIA Area Offices in: Aberdeen, SD; Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; Arlington, VA; Billings, MT; Gallup, NM; Juneau, AK; Minneapolis, MN; Muskogee, OK; Phoenix, AZ; Portland, OR; or Sacramento, CA; or by writing to the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.

      (c) Permit applications proposing the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands shall include the following consent documents:

      (1) Written permission from the Indian landowner and from the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over those lands. This must contain such terms and conditions as the landowner or tribe may request be included in the permit. Where the permission is from a tribe, it should either state that no religious or cultural site will be harmed or destroyed by the proposed work or specify terms and conditions that the permit must include in order to safeguard against such harm or destruction.

      (i) For lands of Indian tribes, permission must be granted by the tribe.

      (ii) For lands of Indian individuals not under tribal jurisdiction, permission must be granted by the owner(s), except as provided in § 262.6.

      (iii) For lands of Indian individuals under tribal jurisdiction, permission must be granted by both the owner(s), except as provided in § 262.6, and the tribe having such jurisdiction. Where an applicant is the owner, consent must still be obtained from the tribe.

      (iv) Where the ownership of lands of Indian individuals is multiple, permission must be granted by the owners of a majority of interests, except as provided in § 262.6. The same shall apply where the applicant is one of the owners.

      (v) Where the terms and conditions a tribe or landowner requests be included in a permit are in conflict with the provisions of this or any other Act, with Federal regulations, or with each other, the Area Director may negotiate with the requestor to eliminate the conflict. If the conflict remains, the permit may not be issued.

      (2) Copies of any permits required by tribal law for archaeological work on lands under tribal jurisdiction. This may serve as written consent from the tribe for the purposes of § 262.5(c)(1).

      (3) Written agreement by the Indian landowner(s) to release archaeological resources for curation or study, as specified in § 262.8(b).

      (d) Permits issued by the BIA shall include the following or similar condition: “Human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony may not be excavated or removed unless the permittee has obtained the written consent of the Area Director. In order to obtain consent, the permittee shall present to the Area Director written evidence of prior consultation with the appropriate Indian tribe. If the lands containing the remains or objects are tribal lands, the permittee shall first obtain the written consent of the tribe having jurisdiction over the lands.” Determination as to which tribe is the appropriate tribe shall be made in accordance with § 262.8(a). Area Director consent shall be based on the scientific appropriateness of the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis and may, if documented, be oral. This condition may be omitted from the permit when such excavation or removal is proposed, and the requirements of the condition are met, in the permit application.

      (e) Information and assistance in contacting Indian tribes and individual Indian landowners for the purpose of requesting the consent documents listed under paragraph (c) of this section or of seeking the consultation and consent required under paragraph (d) of this section may be obtained from the BIA office to which the permit application is submitted.

      (f) Contractual agreements with the BIA or Indian tribes and permits issued by Indian tribes may be accepted as support documents for permit applications. They may also double as permit documents, if they demonstrate that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at 43 CFR part 7 have been met and they are attached to a Department of the Interior permit form. This form must be signed by the Area Director, but need only contain the following or similar statement: “This permit is issued to the person(s) named, and in accordance with the terms and conditions in the attached (contractual agreement/tribal permit).”

      (g) Area Directors shall respond to permit applications within 15 working days of receipt.

      § 262.6   Landowner consent by the Secretary.

#### § § 262.6

      The Secretary of the Interior, or delegate thereof, may, on behalf of the owner(s) of lands of Indian individuals, grant consent for the purposes in § 262.5(c)(1) and (3) when the Secretary or his or her delegate finds that such consent will not result in any injury to the land or owner(s) and when one or more of the following conditions exist:

      (a) The owner is a minor or a person

      (b) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner have not been determined;

      (c) The whereabouts of the owner are unknown;

      (d) Multiple owners are so numerous that the Secretary or his or her delegate finds, after documenting his or her efforts to do so, that it would be impractical to obtain their consent, as prescribed in § 262.5(c)(1)(iv) and provided the Secretary or his or her delegate also notifies, in writing, the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over the land and allows 15 working days from the date of mailing date for response; or

      (e) The owner has given the Secretary or his or her delegate written authority to grant such consent on his or her behalf.

      § 262.7   Notice to Indian tribes of possible harm to cultural or religious sites.

#### § § 262.7

      When consent by an Indian tribe to proposed excavation or removal of archaeological resources from Indian lands it owns or over which it has jurisdiction contains all of the information written as prescribed and advised in § 262.5(c)(1), it may be taken to mean that subject to such terms and conditions as the tribe might specify, issuance of a permit for the proposed work will not result in harm to, or destruction of, any site of religious or cultural importance. No further notification is necessary, unless the Area Director has reason to believe that the proposed work might harm or destroy a site of religious or cultural importance to another tribe or Native American group. He or she shall then follow the notification procedures at 43 CFR 7.7. Those procedures must also be followed when proposed work might affect lands of Indian individuals over which there is no tribal jurisdiction or public lands owned or administered by the BIA.

      § 262.8   Custody of archaeological resources.

#### § § 262.8

      (a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands, except for human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony, remain the property of the Indian tribe or individual(s) having rights of ownership over such lands. Ownership and right of control over the disposition of the excepted items shall be in accordance with the order of priority provided in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Pub. L. 101-601), adapted for the purpose of this rule as follows:

      (1) In the case of human remains of Indians and funerary objects, in the lineal descendants of the Indian; or

      (2) In any case in which such lineal descendants cannot be ascertained, and in the case of sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony:

      (i) In the Indian tribe on whose tribal lands, or on the individual Indian lands of whose members, such remains or objects are discovered;

      (ii) In the Indian tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the public lands owned or administered by the BIA on which such remains or objects are discovered, if upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those remains or objects; or

      (iii) Where it can be so demonstrated by a preponderance of evidence, in the tribe other than that in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section having the strongest cultural relationship with such remains or objects, if, upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those remains or objects.

      (iv) The Area Director shall provide the required notice to any Indian tribe identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, in writing, within 5 working days after such identification has been documented and confirmed, and shall at the same time submit a copy of the notice for publication in the  This notice shall include a description of the remains or objects; of where, how, and why they were excavated or removed; and of the evidence used to identify the tribe being notified. The remains or objects in question shall be considered the property of the pertinent tribe under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section or, in the case of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, held and administered by the BIA until or unless a claim is stated.

      (b) No permit for the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands may be issued without the written consent of the Indian landowner(s) either to grant custody of the resources recovered (other than human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony) to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79 or to allow the permittee a reasonable period of time to hold or have ready access to them at an appropriate location for study. The excepted remains and objects are covered under § 262.5(d) of this part which, in general, permits their excavation or removal only when the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis are scientifically appropriate. Written consent to custody by a curatorial facility may include terms and conditions regarding curation (e.g., cleaning, viewing, loaning, studying, etc.), provided these are consistent with 36 CFR part 79.

      (1) On lands of Indian tribes, consent must be obtained from the tribe.

      (2) On lands of Indian individuals, consent must be obtained from the owner of the land or the owners of a majority of interests therein, except as provided in § 262.6.

      (3) Where consent is by the owners of a majority of interests, it must, if the archaeological resources are to be retained by or returned after study to the interest holders, designate a representative to receive those resources. Whether and how these are subsequently distributed among themselves is a matter for the interest holders to decide.

      (c) The Area Director may, after notifying the tribe (if any) having jurisdiction over such lands and allowing 15 working days for response, decline to issue a permit for lands of Indian individuals if he or she has any verifiable reason to believe that archaeological resources retained by the landowner(s) after being studied will be sold or exchanged other than to the tribe having jurisdiction or to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. The basis for decline shall be that excavation or removal of resources under such circumstances would not be in the public interest and would thus be contrary to the purposes of the Act.

      (d) The landowner(s) alone may grant custody of archaeological resources (except for human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony, which are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section) excavated or removed from lands of Indian individuals that are under tribal jurisdiction to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. When, however, such consignment constitutes the ultimate disposition of these resources, the tribe having jurisdiction must also grant its consent. Any subsequent exchange or disposition by the facility must have the consent of both the landowner(s) and the tribe.

    PART 265—ESTABLISHMENT OF ROADLESS AND WILD AREAS ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS

### Part 265

      § 265.1   Definition of roadless area.

      (b) Foot trails and horse trails are not barred. The Superintendent of the Wind River Reservation on which this roadless area has been established will be held strictly accountable for seeing that the area is maintained in a roadless condition.

        § 273.101   What is the purpose and scope of this part?

#### § § 273.101

        The purpose of this part is to set forth the process by which the Secretary will enter into contracts for the education of Indian students under the Johnson-O'Malley Act. Such contracts are for the purpose of financially assisting those efforts designed to meet the specialized and unique educational needs of eligible Indian students, including supplemental programs and school operational support, where such support is necessary to maintain established State educational standards.

        § 273.102   How will revision or amendments be made to this part?

#### § § 273.102

        Prior to making any substantive revisions or amendments to this part, the Secretary will consult with Indian Tribes and national and regional Indian organizations to the extent practicable about the need for revision or amendment and will consider their views in preparing the proposed revision or amendment. Nothing in this section precludes Indian Tribes or national or regional Indian organizations from initiating a request for revisions or amendments.

        § 273.103   What is the Secretary's policy of maximum Indian participation?

#### § § 273.103

        The meaningful participation in all aspects of educational program development and implementation by those affected by such programs is an essential requisite for success. Such participation not only enhances program responsiveness to the needs of those served, but also provides them with the opportunity to determine and affect the desired level of educational achievement and satisfaction which education can and should provide. Consistent with this concept, maximum Indian participation in the development, approval, and implementation of all programs contracted under this part is required.

        § 273.104   How will the Secretary extend geographic coverage and enhance participation under the Johnson-O'Malley Act?

#### § § 273.104

        The Secretary will, to the extent practicable, and subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure full geographic coverage and the full participation of all federally recognized Tribes and school districts, regardless of whether the school districts or Tribal organizations had entered into a contract under the Johnson-O'Malley Act before fiscal year 1995. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary will consult with Indian Tribes and contact State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and Alaska Native organizations that have not previously entered into a contract in the implementation of this section.

        § 273.105   How do these regulations affect existing Tribal rights?

        (1) The State average cost per pupil count divided by the national average cost per pupil count; or

        (2) A default weight factor of 1.3, if the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section results in a weight factor of less than 1.3.

        (b) State, local and other Federal funds must be used to provide comparable services to non-Indian and Indian students prior to the use of contract funds.

        (c) Except as hereinafter provided, the school lunch program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) constitutes the only federally funded school lunch program for Indian students in public schools. Where Indian students do not qualify to receive free lunches under the National School Lunch Program of USDA because such students are non-needy and do not meet the family size and income guidelines for free USDA lunches, plans prepared pursuant to § 273.119 may provide, to the extent of funding available for Johnson-O'Malley programs, for free school lunches for those students who do not qualify for free USDA lunches but who are eligible Indian students under § 273.112.

#### § § 273.144

        In no instance may contract funds provided under this part be used as payment for capital outlay or debt retirement expenses; except that, such costs are allowable if they are considered to be a part of the full per capita cost of educating eligible Indian students who reside in Federal boarding facilities for the purpose of attending public schools.

      (5) Procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and the disbursement by the grantee, whenever funds are advanced by the Federal Government.

      (d) Between the required performance reporting dates, events may occur which have significant impact upon the project or program. In such cases, the grantee shall inform the Bureau as soon as the following types of conditions become known:

      (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially affect the ability to attain program objectives, prevent the meeting of time schedules and goals, or preclude the attainment of project work units by established time periods. This disclosure shall be accomplished by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Bureau assistance needed to resolve the situation.

      (2) Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units than originally projected.

      (e) If any performance review conducted by the grantee discloses the need for change in the budget estimates in accordance with the criteria established in § 276.14, the grantee shall submit a request for budget revision.

      (f) The bureau shall make site visits as frequently as practicable to:

      (1) Review program accomplishments and management control systems.

      (2) Provide such technical assistance as may be required, or requested.

      § 276.10   Grant payment requirements.

#### § § 276.10

      (a) Except for construction grants for which the letter-of-credit method is optional, the letter-of-credit funding method shall be used by the Bureau where all of the following conditions exist:

      (1) When there is or will be a continuing relationship between a grantee and the Bureau for at least a 12-month period and the total amount of advances to be received within that period from the Bureau is $120,000, or more, as prescribed by Treasury Circular No. 1075.

      (2) When the grantee has established or demonstrated to the Bureau the willingness and ability to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the grantee.

      (3) When the grantee's financial management system meets the standards for fund control and accountability prescribed in § 276.7.

      (b) The method of advancing funds by Treasury check shall be used, in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Circular No. 1075, when the grantee meets all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.

      (c) The reimbursement by Treasury check method shall be the preferred method when the grantee does not meet the requirements specified in either paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3), or both. This method may also be used when the major portion of the program is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and when the Bureau grant assistance constitutes a minor portion of the program.

      (d) Unless otherwise required by law, the Bureau shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by grantees at any time during the grant period unless:

      (1) A grantee has failed to comply with the program objectives, grant award conditions, or Bureau reporting requirements; or

      (2) The grantee is indebted to the United States and collection of the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of any grant program sponsored by the United States. Under such conditions, the Bureau may, upon reasonable notice, inform the grantee that payments will not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

      (e) Appendix B of this part provides the procedures for requesting advances or reimbursements.

      § 276.11   Property management standards.

#### § § 276.11

      (a) Grantees may follow their own property management policies and procedures if they observe the requirements of this section. With respect to property covered by this section, the Bureau may not impose on grantees any requirements (including property reporting requirements)—not authorized by this part unless specifically required by Federal law.

      (b) Title to real property to be acquired in whole or in part from a Bureau grant under part 900 of this chapter shall vest in one of the following manners:

      (1) Title may be taken by the United States in trust for the Indian tribe upon the request of the tribe and when the real property to be acquired is within the reservation boundaries or adjoins on at least two sides other trust or restricted lands as prescribed in part 900 of this chapter.

      (2) Fee title to the acquired real property shall vest in the Indian tribe whenever the acquisition does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless for other reasons a tribe requests title to be taken in the name of the United States. In the absence of applicable statutory authority governing the disposition of real property acquired by a tribe, the tribe shall use the real property for the authorized purposes and in accordance with any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the original grant. Changes in use compatible to other tribal programs may be authorized by the Bureau. When no longer needed for the authorized purposes, the real property shall be used in accordance with the standards set forth in § 276.11(d)(1) for non-expendable personal property. Accordingly, the following priority order for use of such property shall be:

      (i) Other grants from the Bureau.

      (ii) Grants from other Federal agencies.

      (iii) Tribal purposes consistent with those authorized for support by Bureau grants.

      (iv) Tribal official activities.

      (3) In those instances where the Indian tribe requests, title may be acquired by the United States. Use of these acquired real property interests will be subject to the authorized purposes and in accordance with the provisions of the original grant. Upon a determination that the real property is no longer needed for the authorized purposes, disposition may be made by declaring it excess under provisions of the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954) and title transferred to the Secretary to be held by the United States in trust for the tribe. Where real property does not meet the requirements under the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954), the tribe may elect to acquire title under applicable enabling statutory authorities, or in the absence of statutory authority, request withholding disposition in aid of legislation, or authorize disposal under the General Services Administration procedures.

      (c) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section shall also apply when real property is acquired in whole or in part by a Bureau grant other than that provided under part 900 of this chapter. However, when such property is acquired by a grantee other than an Indian tribe, or a tribal governing body, fee simple title to the property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. In the absence of applicable statutory provisions governing the use or disposition of such property, it shall be subject to the following requirments, in addition to any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the grant:

      (1) The grantee shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the original grant as long as needed.

      (2) The grantee shall obtain approval by the Bureau for the use of the real property in other projects when the grantee determines that the property is no longer needed for the original grant purposes. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under other Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the grantor.

      (3) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the grantee shall return all real property furnished or purchased wholly with Bureau grant funds to the control of the Bureau. In the case of property purchased in part with Bureau grant funds, the grantee may be permitted to take title to the Federal interest therein upon compensating the Federal Government for its fair share of the property. The Federal share of the property shall be the amount computed by applying the percentage of the Federal participation in the total cost of the grant program for which the property was acquired to the current fair market value of the property.

      (d) Standards and procedures governing ownership, use, and disposition of nonexpendable personal property furnished by the Bureau or acquired with Bureau funds are set forth below:

      (1)  When nonexpendable personal property is acquired by a grantee wholly or in part with Bureau funds, title will not be taken by the Bureau except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section but shall be vested in the grantee subject to the following restrictions on use and disposition of the property:

      (i) The grantee shall retain the property acquired with Bureau funds in the grant program as long as there is a need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program whether or not the program continues to be supported by Bureau funds. When there is no longer a need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with the other Federal grants it has received in the following order of priority:

      (A) Other grants from the Bureau needing the property.

      (B) Grants of other Federal agencies needing the property.

      (ii) When the grantee no longer has need for the property in any of its Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the grantor, the property may be used for its own official activities in accordance with the following standards:

      (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of less than $500 and used four years or more. The grantee may use the property for its own official activities without reimbursement to the Federal government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.

      (B) All other nonexpendable property. The grantee may retain the property for its own use if a fair compensation is made to the Bureau for the latter's share of the property. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of the property.

      (iii) If the grantee has no need for the property, disposition of the property shall be made as follows:

      (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or less. Except for that property which meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau an amount which is computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

      (B) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of over $1,000. The grantee shall request disposition instructions from the Bureau. The Bureau shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the Bureau's requirement. If no requirement exists within the Bureau, the availability of the property shall be reported to the General Services Administration (GSA) by the Bureau to determine whether a requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. The Bureau shall issue instructions to the grantee within 120 days and the following procedures shall govern:

      () If the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

      () If the grantee is instructed to otherwise dispose of the property, he shall be reimbursed by the Bureau of such costs incurred in its disposition.

      () If disposition instructions are not issued within 120 days after reporting, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau and amount which is computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. Further, the grantee shall be permitted to retain $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.

      (iv) Where the Bureau determines that property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more and financed solely with Bureau funds is unique, different, or costly to replace, it may reserve title to such property, subject to the following provisions:

      (A) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant agreement or otherwise made known to the grantee.

      (B) The Bureau shall issue disposition instructions within 120 days after the completion of the need for the property under the grant for which it was acquired. If the Bureau fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 days, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(B), and (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.

      (2) Federally owned nonexpendable personal property. Unless statutory authority to transfer title has been granted to an agency, title to Federally owned property (property to which the Federal Government retains title including excess property made available by the Bureau to grantees) remains vested by law in the Federal Government. Upon termination of the grant or need for the property, such property shall be reported to the Bureau for further Bureau use or, if appropriate, for reporting to the General Services Administration for other Federal agency use. Appropriate disposition instructions will be issued to the grantee after completion of Bureau review.

      (e) The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall also include the following procedural requirements:

      (1) Property records shall be maintained accurately and provide for a description of the property; manufacturer's serial number or other identification number; acquisition date and cost; source of the property; percentage of Federal funds used in the purchase of property; location, use, and condition of the property; and ultimate disposition data including sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value if the grantee reimburses the bureau for its share.

      (2) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to verify the existence, current use, and continued need for the property.

      (3) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented.

      (4) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.

      (5) Proper sales procedures shall be established for unneeded property which would provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

      (f) When the total inventory value of any unused expendable personal property exceeds $500 at the expiration of need for any grant purposes, the grantee may retain the property or sell the property as long as he compensates the Bureau for its share in the cost. The amount of compensation shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

      (g) Specific standards for control of intangible property are provided as follows:

      (1) If any program produces patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions, in the course of work aided by a Bureau grant, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Bureau. Unless there is prior agreement between the grantee and Bureau on disposition of such items, the Bureau shall determine whether protection on such invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the invention or discovery—including rights under any patent issued on it—shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest consistent with “Government Patent Policy” (President's memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies), dated August 23, 1971, and Statement of Government Patent Policy as printed in 36 FR 16889.

      (2) Where the grant results in a book or other copyrightable material, the author or grantee is eligible to copyright the work if it is found that (i) the retention of the copyright is not precluded by statute and (ii) equity or the public interest is best served by doing so, by reason of special circumstances. If it is found that the public interest is best served by limiting the term of any copyright to be obtained, such limits shall be set forth in the grant agreement. “Developmental” copyrights may be requested during the development, testing, or evaluation of copyrightable materials in order to prevent them from prematurely falling into the public domain. The copyright will be in accordance with copyright laws. However, the Government shall receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use the work for Government purposes. A copy of any copyright obtained by a grantee shall be provided to the Bureau. Program income received as royalties from copyrights on materials produced under grants is retained by the grantee during the grant period and is to be used according to the provisions of § 276.6(c). Specific agreements between the Bureau and the grantee shall be entered into before the grant is awarded to determine the uses of the royalty income after the grant is completed or terminated.

      (h) The use of Bureau-owned facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner by a grantee for purposes of carrying out a grant may be authorized when the facilities are not needed for Bureau purposes.

> [40 FR 51316, Nov. 4, 1975, as amended at 43 FR 37446, Aug. 23, 1978; 64 FR 13897, Mar. 23, 1999]

      § 276.12   Procurement standards.

#### § § 276.12

      (a) The standards contained in this section do not relieve the grantee of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contracts. The grantee is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Bureau regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into, in support of a grant. This includes but is not limited to: disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to the tribal, Federal or other authority which has proper jurisdiction.

      (b) Grantees may use their own procurement regulations provided that procurements made with Bureau grant funds adhere to the standards set forth as follows:

      (1) The grantee shall maintain a code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents in contracting with and expending Bureau grant funds. Grantee's officers, employees or agents, shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or potential contractors. To the extent permissible by law, rules or regulations, such standards shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by either the grantee officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents.

      (2) All procurement transactions regardless of whether negotiated or advertised and without regard to dollar value shall be conducted in a manner so as to provide maximum open and free competition. The grantee should be alert to organizational conflicts of interest or non-competitive practices among contractors which may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

      (3) The grantee shall establish procurement procedures which provide for, as a minimum, the following procedural requirements:

      (i) Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by grantee official to avoid purchasing unnecessary or duplicative items. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical, practical procurement.

      (ii) Invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall be based upon a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition. “Brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. When so used, the specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors should be clearly specified.

      (iii) Positive efforts shall be made by the grantees to use small business and minority-owned business sources of supplies and services. Such efforts should allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete for contracts to be performed using Bureau grant funds. However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

      (iv) The type of procuring instruments used (i.e., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, etc.) shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the grant program involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” method of contracting shall not be used.

      (v) Formal advertising, with adequate purchase description, sealed bids, and public openings shall be the required method of procurement unless negotiation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section is necessary to accomplish sound procurement. However, procurement of $10,000 or less need not be so advertised. Where such advertised bids are obtained the awards shall be made to the responsible bidder whose bid is responsive to the invitation and is most advantageous to the grantee, price and other factors considered. (Factors such as discounts, transportation costs, taxes may be considered in determining the lowest bid.) Invitations for bids shall clearly set forth all requirements which the bidder must fulfill in order for his bid to be evaluated by the grantee. Any or all bids may be rejected when it is in the grantee's interest to do so.

      (vi) Procurements may be negotiated if it is impractical and unfeasible to use formal advertising. Generally, procurements may be negotiated by the grantee if:

      (A) The public exigency will not permit the delay incident to advertising;

      (B) The material or service to be procured is available from only one person or firm; (all contemplated sole source procurements where the aggregate expenditure is expected to exceed $5,000 shall be referred to the Bureau for prior approval).

      (C) The total amount involved does not exceed $10,000;

      (D) The contract is for personal or professional services, or for any service to be rendered by a university, college, or other educational institutions;

      (E) No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;

      (F) The purchases are for highly perishable materials or medical supplies; for material or services where the prices are established by law; for technical items or equipment requiring standardization and interchangeability of parts with existing equipment; for experimental, developmental or research work; for supplies purchased for authorized resale; and for technical or specialized supplies requiring substantial initial investment for manufacture;

      (G) Otherwise authorized by law, rules or regulations. Notwithstanding the existence of circumstances justifying negotiation, competition shall be obtained to the maximum extent practicable.

      (vii) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, or accessibility to other necessary resources.

      (viii) Procurement records or files for purchases in amounts over $10,000 shall provide at least the following pertinent information: Justification for the use of negotiation in lieu of advertising, contractor selection, and the basis for the cost or price negotiation.

      (ix) A system for contract administration shall be maintained to assure contractor conformance with terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract or order, and to assure adequate and timely followup of all purchases.

      (c) In addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the grantee shall include the following provisions in all contracts and subgrants:

      (1) Contracts shall contain such contractual provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate.

      (2) All contracts, amounts for which are over $10,000 shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the grantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions where the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

      (3) In all contracts for construction or facility improvement awarded over $100,000, grantees shall observe the bonding requirements provided in § 276.4.

      (4) All construction contracts awarded by recipients and their contractors or subgrantees having a value of more than $10,000, shall contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Labor Regulations (41 CFR part 87). However, this Equal Employment Opportunity provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

      (5) All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kick Back” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). This Act provides that each contractor or subgrantee shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The grantee shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.

      (6) When required by the Federal grant program legislation, all construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under this Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less often than once a week. The grantee shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The grantee shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.

      (7) Where applicable, all contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 for construction contracts and over $2,500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under section 103 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work day of 8 hours and a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard workday or workweek is permissible if the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1  times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 8 hours in any calendar day or 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act applies to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health and safety as determined under construction, safety, and health standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.

      (8) Contracts or agreements, the principal purpose of which is to create, develop, or improve products, processes or methods; or for exploration into fields which directly concern public health, safety, or welfare; or constraints in the field of science or technology in which there has been little significant experience outside of work funded by Federal assistance, shall contain a notice to the effect that matters regarding rights to inventions, and materials generated under the contract or agreement are subject to the regulations issued by the Bureau. The contractor shall be advised as to the source of additional information regarding these matters.

      (9) All negotiated contracts (except those of $10,000 or less) awarded by grantees shall include a provision to the effect that the grantee, the Bureau, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific grant program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

      (10) Contracts and subgrants of amounts over $100,000 shall contain a provision which requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders, or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 1251 ) as amended. Violations shall be reported to the Bureau and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

      § 276.13   Indian preference in grant administration.

#### § § 276.13

      Any grant or subgrant shall require that to the greatest extent feasible:

      (a) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of such a grant or subgrant shall be given to Indians.

      (b) Preference in the award of a subgrant, contract or subcontract in connection with administration of a grant shall be given to Indian organizations and economic enterprises.

      (c) A tribal governing body may develop its own Indian preference requirements to the extent that such requirements are not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for grants executed under this part.

      § 276.14   Budget revision.

#### § § 276.14

      Criteria and procedures to be followed by grantees in reporting deviations from grant budgets and requesting approval for budget revisions are as follows:

      (a) For nonconstruction grants, grantees shall request prior approvals promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:

      (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the grant-supported program.

      (2) The revision indicates the need for additional Bureau funding.

      (3) The grant budget is over $100,000 and the cumulative amount of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is expected to exceed $10,000, or five percent of the grant budget, whichever is greater. The same criteria apply to cumulative amount of transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those intended.

      (4) The grant budget is $100,000, or less, and the cumulative amount of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is expected to exceed five percent of the grant budget. The same criteria apply to the cumulative amount of transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those intended.

      (5) The revisions involve the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs.

      (6) The revisions pertain to the addition of items requiring approval in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this part.

      (b) All other changes to nonconstruction grant budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (d) of this section do not require approval. These changes include:

      (1) The use of grantee funds in furtherance of program objectives over and above the grantee minimum share included in the approved grant budget and

      (2) The transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb authorized increases in indirect costs.

      (c) For construction grants, grantees shall request prior approval promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:

      (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the grant-supported programs.

      (2) The revision increases the budgeted amounts of Bureau funds needed to complete the project.

      (d) When the Bureau awards a grant which provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Bureau may require, in the grant agreement, the grantee to request prior approval before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

      (e) For both construction and nonconstruction grants, the Bureau shall require tribal grantees to notify the Bureau promptly whenever the amount of Bureau authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the grantee by more than $5,000 or 5 percent of the Bureau grant, whichever is greater. This notification will not be required when applications for additional funding are submitted for continuing grants.

      (f) When requesting approval for budget revisions, grantees shall use the budget forms which were used in the grant application. However, grantees may request by letter the approvals required by the provisions of appendix A of this part.

      (g) Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Bureau shall review the request and notify the grantee whether or not the budget revisions have been approved. If the Bureau does not reach a decision prior to the end of the 30-day period or should the grantee not be notified of the Bureau's decision by the end of the 30-day period the grantee may appeal directly to the Commissioner.

      § 276.15   Grant closeout.

#### § § 276.15

      (a) In closing out Bureau grants, the following shall be observed:

      (1) Upon request, the Bureau shall make prompt payments to a grantee for allowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out.

      (2) The grantee shall immediately refund to the Bureau any unencumbered balance of cash advanced to the grantee.

      (3) The Bureau shall obtain from the grantee within 90 days after the date of completion of the grant all financial, peformance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant. The Bureau may grant extensions when requested by the grantee.

      (5) The grantee shall account for any property acquired with grant funds, or received from the Government in accordance with the provisions of § 276.11.

      (6) If a final audit has not been performed before the closeout of the grant, the Bureau shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

      (b)  When a grantee has materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a grant, the Bureau may after reasonable notice to the grantee, suspend the grant. The notice preceding suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the reasons for the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for reinstatement of the grant, and, if there is no immediate threat to safety, a reasonable time frame for corrective action prior to actual suspension. No obligations incurred by the grantee during the period of suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the Bureau may at its discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspensions if such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost principles specified in appendix A of this part. Appropriate adjustments to the payments under the suspended grant will be made, either by withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for disbursements which he may make in liquidation of unauthorized obligations he incurs during the period of suspension.

      (2) When it appears that cancellation of a grant shall become necessary, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of this possibility. This written notice shall advise the grantee of the reason for the possible cancellation and the corrective action necessary to avoid cancellation. The Bureau shall also offer, and provide if requested by the grantee, any technical assistance which may be required to effect the corrective action. The grantee shall have 60 days in which to effect this corrective action before the Bureau provides notice of intent to cancel the grant as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

      (3) Upon deciding to cancel for cause, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of that decision, the reasons for the cancellation, and the effective date. The Bureau shall also provide a hearing for the grantee before cancellation, as provided in § 272.51. However, the Bureau may immediately cancel the grant, upon notice to the grantee, if the Bureau determines that continuance of the grant poses an immediate threat to safety. In this event, the Bureau shall provide a hearing for the grantee within ten (10) days of cancellation.

      (4) Payments made to grantees or recoveries by the Bureau under grants cancelled for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights and obligations of the parties.

      (d)(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, grants may be cancelled in whole or in part only as follows:

      (i) By the Bureau with the consent of the grantee, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the cancellation conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled; or

      (ii) By the grantee, upon written notice to the Bureau, setting forth the reasons for the cancellation, the effective date, and, in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled.

      (2) When a grant is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the grantee shall not incur new obligations for the cancelled portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Bureau shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Bureau share of the noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the grantee before cancellation.

#### § § 276.16

      The uniform administrative requirements in this part, including the cost principles in appendix A, to this part, are applicable to all subgrants or subcontracts made by a grantee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. However, these requirements and cost principles are applicable as minimum standards for subgrants or subcontracts made to nonprofit organizations. Accordingly, the grantee may prescribe additional or more stringent requirements with regard to subgrants or subcontracts made to non-profit organizations.

#### § § 276.17

      As permitted by paragraph 36-2(c) in the Government Printing and Binding Regulations (October 1974, No. 23), published by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP), printing required by a grantee in performing work under a grant is considered “incidental printing” (e.g., material which the grantee needs to use to respond to the terms of the grant). Whenever the incidental printing is likely to exceed the exclusions in paragraphs 36-3 and 36-4 of the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) Printing and Binding Regulations, specific provisions on printing as may be required shall be included in the grant agreement. Grantees shall be given the option of using sources other than the Government Printing Office for incidental printing.

      § 286.2   Purpose.

#### § § 286.2

      The purpose of this part 286 is to prescribe the regulations and procedures under which non-reimbursable grants may be made to eligible applicants to stimulate and increase Indian entrepreneurship and employment through establishment, acquisition or expansion of profit-making Indian-owned economic enterprises which will contribute to the economy of a reservation.

      § 286.3   Eligible applicants.

#### § § 286.3

      Applications for grants may be accepted only from individual Indians, Indian tribes, Indian partnerships, corporations or cooperative associations authorized to do business under State, Federal, or Tribal law. These applicants must have a form of organization acceptable to the Assistant Secretary and unable to meet their total financing needs from their own resources and by loans from other sources such as banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production Credit Associations, and Federal Land Banks. Associations, corporations or partnerships shall be at least fifty-one percent owned by eligible Indians or an eligible Indian tribe. This Indian ownership must actively participate in the management and operation of the economic enterprise by representation on the board of directors of a corporation or cooperative association proportionate to the Indian ownership which will enable the Indian owner(s) to control management decisions.

In the case of Indian-owned cooperative associations, they must distribute or allocate profits for later distribution, to members who are patrons, unless prohibited from doing so by law.

      § 286.5   Information collection.

#### § § 286.5

#### § § 286.15

      Applications are to be submitted to the Superintendent having administrative jurisdiction over the reservation on which an enterprise will be or is located.

#### § § 286.16

      Applications for grants require approval by the Assistant Secretary.

      § 286.17   Grant limitations and requirements.

#### § § 286.17

      (a) Grants will be made to assist in establishing new economic enterprises, or in purchasing or expanding established ones. However, a grant may be made only when in the opinion of the Assistant Secretary the applicant is unable to obtain adequate financing from other sources. Prior to making any grant, the Assistant Secretary shall assure that, to the extent practical, the applicant's own resources have been invested in the proposed project. The applicant shall not be required to invest own resources to the extent that they are already committed to endeavors deemed by the Assistant Secretary to be essential to the welfare of the applicant. If the information in an application, which must include personal financial statements, indicates that it may be possible for the applicant to obtain financing without a grant, the Assistant Secretary will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area, if available, who are making loans for similar purpose, showing whether or not they will make a loan to the applicant for the total financing needed without a grant.

      (b) A grant may be made only to an applicant who is able to obtain at least 75 percent of the necessary financing from other sources.

      (c) No grant in excess of $250,000 may be made to an Indian tribe or in excess of $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.

      (d) Revolving loan funds as prescribed in title I of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and guaranteed or insured loans as prescribed in title II of said Act may not be used as the sources of the loan portion of the total financing requirement if financing from other governmental or institutional lenders is available on reasonable terms and conditions. If a loan is not available from other sources, guaranteed or insured loans under the provisions of title II of said Act may then be considered. If a guaranteed or insured loan is not available loans under the provisions of title I of said Act may then be considered. Applicants for a loan from either source must meet the eligibility requirements for such loans.

      (e) A grant will not be approved unless there is assurance the applicant can and will be provided with needed competent technical and management assistance commensurate with the nature of the enterprise to be funded and the knowledge and management skills of the applicant.

      (f) Grant funds may not be used for refinancing or debt consolidation unless approval is justified and required due to the applicant's financial position and is clearly to the advantage of the grant applicant.

      (g) Ordinarily, not more than one grant will be made for a project. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances a second grant may be made to applicants for a new project or expansion of the original project. An additional grant will not be approved for an economic enterprise previously funded under the provisions of title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 except for expanding a successful enterprise, provided the total of grants made shall not exceed $250,000 to an Indian tribe and $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.

      (h) An application for a second grant will not be approved if the applicant:

      (1) Has not complied with the reporting requirements in connection with the first grant, or

      (2) Has not followed the plan of operation, if any, developed for the management and operation of the economic enterprise, or

      (3) Did not follow and use the management and technical assistance furnished, or

      (4) Is in violation of one or more provisions of the loan agreement entered into between the applicant and the lender who furnished the loan portion of the financing in connection with the first grant.

      (i) An applicant for an expansion grant must meet the same eligibility requirements as an original applicant.

      (j) A grantee will be required to return all or a portion of the grant if the business or enterprise for which the grant was utilized is sold within three years of the date on which the grant was disbursed to the grantee, unless the proceeds from the sale are re-invested in a new business or business expansion which will benefit the Indian reservation economy. Such sale and re-investment must have the prior approval of the local agency superintendent. The grantee shall refund the lessor of the grant amount or a pro rata portion of sales proceeds. The pro rata portion of sales proceeds shall be based on the ratio of grant amount to its corresponding matching financing. The new business or business expansion utilizing such sale proceeds must meet the same criteria for eligibility as an original grant.

      § 286.21   Return of unused funds.

#### § § 286.21

      Grantees will be required to return unused grant funds to the Assistant Secretary if the economic enterprise for which the grant was approved is not initiated, i.e., lease obtained, if needed, construction started, equipment purchased or other, within the time stated in the grant agreement. The Assistant Secretary may, if warranted by circumstances beyond the control of the grantee, extend the time to allow for initiation of the enterprise, provided there is assurance the enterprise will be initiated forthwith within the extended time period. The Assistant Secretary will notify the lender in writing of a proposed action to require the return of grant funds or of a proposal to extend the time.

These may be copied of financial statements required by and furnished to the lender which provided the loan portion of the total financing required. If the lender does not require financial statements, the grantee must prepare and furnish copies of comparative balance sheets and profit and loss statements to the Assistant Secretary.

      (b) The Assistant Secretary will establish accounting and reporting systems which will appropriately show the status of the Indian Business Development Program at all times.

        (c) If a Tribe or a State (including its political subdivisions) is concerned that its agreement or other document may be considered a “compact” or “amendment,” either party may request in writing a determination from the Department if their agreement or other document is a compact or amendment and therefore must be approved and a notice published in the  prior to the agreement or other document becoming effective. The Department will issue a letter within 30 days of receipt of the written request, providing notice of the Secretary's determination. If the agreement or other document is determined to be a compact or amendment, it must be resubmitted for Secretarial review and approval consistent with the requirements of subpart B of this part.

        § 293.5   Are extensions to compacts or amendments subject to review and approval?

#### § § 293.5

        § 293.16   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing the application of the Tribe's or the State's criminal and civil laws and regulations?

#### § § 293.16

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions addressing the application of the criminal and civil laws and regulations of the Tribe or the State that are directly related to and necessary for the licensing and regulation of the gaming activity. At the request of the Secretary pursuant to § 293.8(e), the parties must show that these laws and regulations are both directly related to and necessary for the licensing and regulation of the gaming activity.

        § 293.17   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing the allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction between the Tribe and the State?

#### § § 293.17

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions allocating criminal and civil jurisdiction between the Tribe and the State necessary for the enforcement of the laws and regulations described in § 293.16.

        § 293.18   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing the State's costs for regulating gaming activities?

#### § § 293.18

        Yes. If the compact or amendment includes a negotiated allocation of jurisdiction to the State for the regulation of the gaming activity, the compact or amendment may include provisions to defray the State's actual and reasonable costs for regulating the specific Tribe's gaming activity. If the compact does not include requirements for the State to show actual and reasonable annual expenses for regulating the specific Tribe's gaming activity over the life of the compact, the lack of such a requirement may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.19   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing the Tribe's taxation of gaming?

#### § § 293.19

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions addressing the Tribe's taxation of tribally licensed gaming activity in amounts comparable to the State's taxation of State licensed gaming activities. A compact may not include provisions addressing the Tribe's taxation of other activities that may occur within or near the Tribe's gaming facility. The inclusion of provisions addressing the Tribe's taxation of other activities may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.20   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing the resolution of disputes for breach of the compact?

#### § § 293.20

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions addressing how the parties will resolve a breach of the compact or other disputes arising from the compact including mutual limited waivers of sovereign immunity. If a Tribe is concerned that an agreement or other document including, but not limited to, any dispute resolution, settlement agreement, or arbitration decision, constitutes a compact or amendment, or if the Tribe is concerned that the agreement or other document interprets the Tribe's compact or amendment to govern matters that are not directly related to the operation of gaming activities, the Tribe may submit the document to the Department as set forth in § 293.4. The inclusion of provisions addressing dispute resolution outside of Federal court in a manner that seeks to avoid the Secretary's review may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.21   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing standards for the operation of gaming activity and maintenance of the gaming facility?

#### § § 293.21

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions addressing the Tribe's standards for the operation of the gaming activity within gaming spaces, as well as the Tribe's standards for the maintenance of the gaming facility, including licensing. If a compact or amendment mandates that the Tribe adopt standards equivalent or comparable to the standards set forth in a State law or regulation, the parties must show that these mandated Tribal standards are both directly related to and necessary for the licensing and regulation of the gaming activity.

        § 293.22   May a compact or amendment include provisions that are directly related to the operation of gaming activities?

#### § § 293.22

        Yes. A compact or amendment may include provisions that are directly related to the operation of gaming activities; such provisions may address activities occurring off of Indian lands.

        § 293.23   What factors will be used to determine whether provisions in a compact or amendment are directly related to the operation of gaming activities?

#### § § 293.23

        (a) The parties must show that these provisions described in § 293.22 are directly connected to the Tribe's conduct of class III gaming activities. Examples include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Minimum age for patrons to participate in gaming;

        (2) Transportation of gaming devices and equipment; or

        (3) Exclusion of patrons.

        (b) Mutually beneficial proximity, or even co-management alone is insufficient to establish a “direct connection” between the Tribe's class III gaming and adjacent business or amenities. Additionally, Tribal infrastructure projects or economic development activities that are funded by gaming revenue and may service or otherwise provide a benefit to the gaming activity are not directly related to the conduct of gaming without other evidence of a direct connection.

        (c) Provisions which are not directly related to the operation of gaming activities include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Expressly limiting third party Tribes' rights to conduct gaming activities under IGRA;

        (2) Relating to treaty rights;

        (3) Relating to tobacco sales;

        (4) Requiring compliance with or adoption of State environmental regulation of projects or activities that are not directly related to the Tribe's operation of gaming activities and maintenance of the gaming facility;

        (5) Requiring memorandum of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, or similar agreements with local governments;

        (6) Requiring enforcement of State court orders garnishing employee wages or patron winnings;

        (7) Granting State court jurisdiction over tort claims arising from the Tribe's conduct of class III gaming activities;

        (8) Regulating non-gaming conduct not within gaming spaces or non-gaming Tribal economic activities, including activities in or adjacent to the gaming facility, including, but not limited to, restaurants, nightclubs, hotels, event centers, water parks, gas stations, and convenience stores; or

        (9) Relating to the conduct of Tribal class I or class II gaming activities.

        (d) The inclusion of provisions for which the parties cannot show a direct connection to the Tribe's conduct of class III gaming activities may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.24   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing rights of employees?

#### § § 293.24

        Yes. Notwithstanding § 293.23(c)(8), a compact or amendment may include provisions or procedures addressing the organizational and representational rights of employees, including service or hospitality workers, where such provisions or procedures are “directly related” to the operation of gaming activities as articulated by the Ninth Circuit in  v.  42 F.4th 1024, 1035-1040 & n.2 (citing  v.  331 F.3d 1094, 1116 (9th Cir. 2003)).

        § 293.25   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing employee background investigations and licensing?

#### § § 293.25

        Yes. Consistent with 25 CFR 558.1, a compact or amendment may include provisions addressing the Tribe's standards and requirements for employee background investigations and licensing. If the compact or amendment includes a negotiated allocation to the State for concurring in or processing employee background investigations or licenses, the parties must show that the licensing process is as stringent and timely as the background investigation and licensing requirements of 25 CFR parts 556 and 558. The compact may also include provisions for the reasonable reimbursement of background investigation and licensing fees.

        § 293.26   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing statewide remote wagering or internet gaming?

#### § § 293.26

        Yes. A compact or amendment consistent with §§ 293.16 and 293.22 may include provisions addressing statewide remote wagering or internet gaming that is directly related to the operation of gaming activity on Indian lands. A compact or compact amendment may not, however, alter otherwise applicable Federal law. A compact may specifically include, for regulatory purposes, provisions allocating State and Tribal jurisdiction within the State over remote wagering or internet gaming originating outside Indian lands where:

        (a) State law and the compact or amendment deem the gaming to take place, for the purposes of State and Tribal law, on the Tribe's Indian lands where the server accepting the wagers is located;

        (b) The Tribe regulates the gaming; and

        (c) The player initiating the wager is not located on another Tribe's Indian lands within the State, unless that Tribe has lawfully consented.

        § 293.27   What factors will the Secretary analyze to determine if revenue sharing is lawful?

#### § § 293.27

        (a) A compact or amendment may include provisions that address revenue sharing in exchange for a State's meaningful concessions resulting in a substantial economic benefit for the Tribe.

        (b) The Department reviews revenue sharing provisions with great scrutiny beginning with the presumption that a Tribe's payment to a State or local government for anything beyond § 293.18 regulatory fee is a prohibited “tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.” In order for the Department to approve revenue sharing the parties must show through documentation, such as a market study or other similar evidence, that:

        (1) The Tribe has requested and the State has offered specific meaningful concessions the State was otherwise not required to negotiate;

        (2) The value of the specific meaningful concessions offered by the State provides substantial economic benefits to the Tribe in a manner justifying the revenue sharing required by the compact; and

        (3) The Tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming measured by projected revenue to the Tribe against projected revenue shared with the State.

        (c) The inclusion of revenue sharing provisions to the State that is not justified by meaningful concessions of substantial economic benefit to the Tribe may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.28   May a compact or extension include provisions that limit the duration of the compact?

#### § § 293.28

        Yes. However, IGRA anticipates compacts are long-term agreements between a Tribe and a State. These agreements reflect carefully negotiated compromises between sovereigns. A refusal to negotiate a long-term compact, or a short-term extension of at least one year to allow for negotiations to continue, may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.

        § 293.29   May any other contract outside of a compact regulate Indian gaming?

#### § § 293.29

        No. Subject to §§ 293.4(b) and 293.8(d), any contract or other agreement between a Tribe and a State, its agencies, or its political subdivisions that seeks to regulate a Tribe's right to conduct gaming—as limited by IGRA—is a gaming compact that must comply with IGRA and be submitted for review and approval by the Secretary consistent with § 293.8. A Tribe may submit any other agreement between the Tribe and the State, its agencies, or its political subdivisions for a determination if the agreement is a compact or amendment under § 293.4(c). This includes agreements mandated or required by a compact or amendment, which contain provisions for the payment from a Tribe's gaming revenue or restricts or regulates a Tribe's use and enjoyment of its Indian lands, including a Tribe's conduct of gaming.

        § 293.30   What effect does this part have on pending requests, final agency decisions already issued, and future requests?

#### § § 293.30

        (a) Compacts and amendments pending on March 22, 2024, will continue to be processed under this part, promulgated on December 5, 2008, and revised June 4, 2020, unless the Tribe or the State requests in writing to proceed under this part. Upon receipt of such a request, the Secretary shall process the pending compact or amendment under this part.

        (b) This part does not alter final agency decisions made pursuant to this part before March 22, 2024.

        (c) All compacts and amendments submitted after March 22, 2024 will be processed under this part.

        § 293.31   How does the Paperwork Reduction Act affect this part?

#### § § 293.31

        The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3507(d), and assigned control number 1076-0172. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
