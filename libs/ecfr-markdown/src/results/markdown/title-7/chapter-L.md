In making this determination, the Agency will use the latest decennial census of the United States. Applications cannot be approved subject to meeting _rural area_ requirements. Locations that are contiguous and adjacent to an urbanized area will be delineated as a non-eligible area in the _Rural_ Development Property Eligibility Map found at:  This map is maintained independently by another government agency and is oriented through census tract data. The following exclusions apply:

      (1) Any area in the urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants that has been determined to be “rural in character” as follows:

      (i) The determination that an area is “rural in character” will be made by the Under Secretary of Rural Development. The process to request a determination under this provision is outlined in paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition. The determination that an area is “rural in character” under this definition will apply to areas that are within:

      (A) An urbanized area that has two points on its boundary that are at least 40 miles apart, which is not contiguous or adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 150,000 inhabitants or the urbanized area of such a city or town; or

      (B) An urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town of greater than 50,000 inhabitants that is within   mile of a rural area.

      (ii) Units of local government may petition the Under Secretary of Rural Development for a “rural in character” designation by submitting a petition to the appropriate Rural Development State Director for recommendation to the Administrator on behalf of the Under Secretary. The petition shall document how the area meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(i)(A) or (B) of this definition and discuss why the petitioner believes the area is “rural in character,” including, but not limited to, the area's population density, demographics, and topography and how the local economy is tied to a rural economic base. Upon receiving a petition, the Under Secretary will consult with the applicable governor or leader in a similar position and request comments to be submitted within 5 business days, unless such comments were submitted with the petition. The Under Secretary will release to the public a notice of a petition filed by a unit of local government not later than 30 days after receipt of the petition by way of publication in a local newspaper and posting on the Agency's website at  and the Under Secretary will make a determination not less than 15 days, but no more than 60 days, after the release of the notice. Upon a negative determination, the Under Secretary will provide to the petitioner an opportunity to appeal a determination to the Under Secretary, and the petitioner will have 10 business days to appeal the determination and provide further information for consideration. The Under Secretary will make a determination of the appeal in not less than 15 days, but no more than 30 days.

      (iii) Rural Development State Directors may also initiate a request to the Under Secretary to determine if an area is “rural in character.” A written recommendation must document how the area meets the statutory requirements of paragraph (1)(i)(B) of this definition and discusses why the State Director believes the area is “rural in character,” including, but not limited to, the area's population density, demographics, topography, and how the local economy is tied to a rural economic base. Upon receipt of such a request, the Administrator will review the request for compliance with the “rural in character” provisions and make a recommendation to the Under Secretary. Provided a favorable determination is made, the Under Secretary will consult with the applicable Governor and request comments within 10 business days, unless gubernatorial comments were submitted with the request. A public notice will be published by the State Office in accordance with paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition. There is no appeal process for requests made on the initiative of the State Director.

      (2) An area that is attached to the urbanized area of a city or town with more than 50,000 inhabitants by a contiguous area of urbanized census blocks that is not more than two census blocks wide. Applicants from such an area should work with their Rural Development State Office to request a determination of whether their project is located in a rural area under this provision. This applies to areas that would not be considered a rural area because they are attached to the urbanized area of a city or town of greater than 50,000 inhabitants by a “string” area that is two census blocks wide or less (which are typically interstates or major highways). As long as the “string” area is two census blocks wide or less, the area outside of the urbanized area, beginning with the “string” area, may be considered rural. Once an area is approved as a string exception, any project within that area is eligible.

      (3) For the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the island is considered Rural and eligible except for the San Juan Census Designated Place (CDP) and any other CDP with greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Areas within CDPs with greater than 50,000 inhabitants, other than the San Juan CDP, may be determined to be Rural if they are “not urban in character.”

      (4) For the State of Hawaii, all areas within the State are considered rural and eligible except for the Honolulu CDP within the County of Honolulu and any other CDP with greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Areas within CDPs with greater than 50,000 inhabitants, other than the Honolulu CDP, may be determined to be rural if they are “not urban in character.”

      means the estimated simple payback of a project funded under this part as calculated using paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition, as applicable.

      (1) Energy efficiency improvement projects simple payback = (Total Project Costs) ÷ (Dollar value of energy saved).

      (i) Energy saved will be determined by subtracting the projected energy (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(B) of this definition) to be consumed from the historical energy consumed (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition), and converting the result to a monetary value using a constant value or price of energy (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(C) of this definition).

      (A) Actual energy used in the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, prior to the EEI project, must be based on the actual average annual total energy used in British thermal units (BTU) over the most recent 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 consecutive months of operation.

      (B) Projected energy use if the proposed EEI project had been in place for the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, for the same time period used to determine that actual energy use under paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition.

      (C) Value or price of energy must be the actual average price paid over the same time period used to calculate the actual energy used under paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition.

      (ii) Energy efficiency improvement projects simple payback does not allow EEI to monetize benefits other than the dollar amount of the energy savings the agricultural producer or rural small business realizes as a result of the improvement.

      (iii) Proposed additional energy consumption by a business which would result in greater savings if implemented is not considered in the payback calculation.

      (2) Renewable energy systems projects simple payback = (total project costs) ÷ (dollar value of energy units replaced, credited, sold, or used and fair market value of byproducts as applicable in a typical year).

      (i) Value of energy replaced will be calculated based on the borrower entity's historical energy consumption with actual average price paid for the energy replaced, following the methodology outlined in paragraph (1)(i) of this definition RES replacement projects which generate more energy than the applicant's historical records document, may add to the replacement value, the value obtained by taking the excess energy generated times a documented market price in order to derive at total dollar value of energy units replaced, credited, sold, or used.

      (ii) Value of energy credited or sold will be calculated based on the amount of energy units to be sold at the proposed rate per unit, as documented in utility net metering or crediting policies and/or a purchase agreement.

      (iii) If proposed energy will be used in a new facility (includes any direct-use project), value of energy used will be calculated based on the amount of energy units to be used at the documented price per unit of conventional fuel alternative.

      (iv) Value of byproducts produced by and used in the project or related enterprises should be documented at the fair market value to be received for the byproducts in a typical year.

      (v) Renewable energy systems projects simple payback does not include any one-time benefits such as but not limited to construction and investment-related benefits, nor credits which do not provide annual income to the project, such as tax credits. These benefits may be considered when appropriate for calculating repayment ability of guaranteed loans.

      (vi) For RES projects that involve a shared meter with a residence where the cost of the system has been prorated, only the eligible prorated amount of energy attributed to the rural business or agricultural producer will be used in the payback calculation. For projects that involve in-eligible expenses other than residential, the full amount of energy production will be used in the payback calculation.

      (3) Energy efficiency equipment and systems projects simple payback = (total project costs) ÷ (dollar value of efficiency savings). Efficiency savings will be determined by subtracting the annual value of energy to be consumed by the proposed energy efficient equipment from the annual value of energy that a conventional equipment alternative would have consumed. Adequate documentation must be provided for all consumption estimates and values utilized in the calculation.

      means an entity that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition:

      § 5001.102   Project eligibility—general.

#### § § 5001.102

      To be eligible for a loan guarantee under this part, a project must meet the requirements specified in this section and those in the applicable section in §§ 5001.103 through 5001.108.

      (a)  For projects with a defined service area, the boundaries for the proposed service area must be chosen in such a way that no user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, disability, or national origin. This does not preclude financing or constructing:

      (1) Projects in phases (each phase must be financially sustainable without consideration of future phases) when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and

      (2) Projects where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire service area, provided the economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system or facility and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to, or parts thereof.

      (b)  A project must be located in a State and meet the rural or rural area requirements of the applicable section in §§ 5001.103 through 5001.108.

      (c)  The agency is prohibited from guaranteeing a project funded with tax-exempt financing. In cases where a project involves both tax-exempt and taxable financing, the portion of the project that involves taxable financing is eligible to receive a loan guarantee if that portion of the project is separate and distinct from the part that is financed by the tax-exempt obligation, and the guaranteed loan is not essential to issuance of the tax-exempt obligation.

      (d)  The Agency can guarantee loans for debt refinancing, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section when the guaranteed loan extinguishes the debt being refinanced. These paragraphs do not apply to REAP loans, see § 5001.121(d)(14) for REAP refinancing provisions. Longer-term financing to pay off a lender's interim construction loan after project completion will not be treated as debt refinancing as long as it meets the requirements for takeout of interim financing in § 5001.121(c)(6). An eligible debt refinancing project is:

      (1) Refinancing of debt on one or more loans owed to another creditor. There is no limit on percent of total use of funds if a new lender is refinancing debt owed to another creditor;

      (2) Refinancing of debt owed to the applicant lender or any part thereof provided that the applicant lender debt being refinanced does not exceed 50 percent of the total use of funds in the new aggregated federally-guaranteed debt, the applicant lender debt being refinanced is in a current status for the past six months and the new guaranteed loan is providing better rates or repayment terms. Better rates or repayment terms can be shown in a variety of ways including the lender providing a fixed rate over a lower variable rate provided the change is advantageous to the borrower's long-term repayment ability. The current status cannot be achieved by the lender forgiving the borrower's debt or by servicing actions that impact the borrower's repayment schedule; or

      (3) Refinancing of debt owed directly to the Federal Government or that is federally-guaranteed, including any guaranteed debt owed to the applicant lender, when a refinance of this debt is consistent with sections 333, “Special Conditions and Limitations on Loans” and 306(a)(24)(C), “Loan Guarantees for Water, Wastewater, and Essential Community Facilities Loans” of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (as amended by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334). Such guaranteed debt shall not be included in the amount of applicant lender debt when calculating the maximum percentage of the total use of funds in the new guaranteed loan as stated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and,

      (4) When the refinancing is in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section, the following requirements must be met:

      (i) The Agency has determined that the project is viable, and debt refinancing is necessary to improve cash flow;

      (ii) The debt is reflected on the borrower's balance sheet and the original loan funds were used for project-eligible purposes. Refinancing of existing of lines of credit is considered an eligible purpose for debt refinancing in the B&I program;

      (iii) For loans to existing businesses where debt refinancing is a majority purpose of the guaranteed loan, the borrower must demonstrate historical debt service coverage ratios using proposed debt service requirements of not less than 1.1 times, or the borrower's current financial performance demonstrates it has corrected or recovered from impacts or issues adversely affecting its past financial performance. The debt service coverage ratio computed based on the current income statement must be at least 1:1 to demonstrate correction or recovery.

      (5) For CF guaranteed loan requests only, refinancing of debt, not including new construction, incurred by a rural hospital to preserve access to a health service when the refinancing will meaningfully improve the financial position of the hospital. The debt can be existing Agency direct loan debt, Agency guaranteed debt, or another lender's debt (including other non-Agency Federal guaranteed debt). Loan requests to refinance rural hospital debt must demonstrate that the new amount of annual debt repayment on the debt being refinanced will be less than the existing amount of annual debt repayment and provide a total debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.1 based on historical cash flow. To calculate the ratio, the new debt service amount will include annual capital expense reserve and annual debt repayment reserve requirements. This information will be provided by the lender on an Agency approved application for loan guarantee and its associated supporting documentation.

      (iii) An eligible cooperative may refinance an existing B&I guaranteed loan if the existing loan is current and performing, the existing loan is not and has not been in monetary default or the collateral has not been converted, and there is adequate security and collateral for the new guaranteed loan.

      (19) Taxable corporate bonds when the bonds are fully amortizing and comply with all provisions of this part, bond proceeds were used for an eligible purpose in this part, and the lender as bond holder retains the percent of the bond in accordance with § 5001.408(3)(i) of this part. The bonds must be fully secured with collateral in accordance with § 5001.202(b)(4) of this part. The bonds must only provide for a trustee when the trustee is totally under the control of the lender. The bonds must provide no rights to bond holders other than the right to receive the payments due under the bond. For instance, the bonds must not provide for bond holders replacing the trustee or directing the trustee to take servicing actions, such as accelerating the bonds. In accordance with § 5001.127(f), convertible bonds are not eligible under this paragraph due to the potential conflict of interest of a lender having an ownership interest in the borrower. An explanation of the type of bond and other bond stipulations must be attached to the bond.

      (i) The bond issuer must obtain the services and opinion of an experienced bond counsel, who must present a legal opinion stating that the bonds are legal, valid, and binding obligations of the issuer and that the issuer has adhered to all applicable laws.

      (20) Nursing homes and assisted living facilities where constant medical care is provided and available onsite to the residents. Independent living facilities are not eligible in accordance with § 5001.118(a). Independent living facilities are considered residential property as they have many similarities to a multi-family housing complex, whereas nursing home and assisted living facility tenants rely on those entities to provide needed personal or medical care. Properties consisting of both assisted care facilities and independent senior living may be eligible if the availability of the on-site medical services is an optional service to the independent living residents, or if the predominant residents of the facility require assisted living care.

      (21) Development and construction of RES, including modification of existing systems that are commercially available and that are not otherwise eligible under REAP, or if funding is not available in the REAP program.

      (iv) Design and engineering;

      (v) Project development;

      (vi) Equipment procurement and installation; and

      (c)  The project must be located in a rural area, except for loans to cooperative in accordance with paragraph (b)(18)(ii) of this section and for loans to local foods projects in accordance with paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section where such projects may also be located in non-rural areas. For an eligible project that located in both rural and non-rural areas, the Agency will guarantee only the amount necessary to finance that portion of the project located in the eligible rural area.

      (d)  Borrowers are required to have sufficient capital or equity to mitigate the ongoing financial and operational risks of the business. The capital/equity requirement must be met in the form of either cash or earning assets contributed to the business and reflected on the borrower's balance sheet. Transfers of assets at fair market value between related parties, which are not arm's length transactions, must be in accordance with GAAP and require evidence that the transaction was entered into at market terms. Equity cannot include appraisal surplus or bargain purchase gains. Subordinated debt may be included when the subordinated debt is in exchange for cash injected into the business that remains in the business for the life of the guaranteed loan. The note or other form of evidence must be submitted to the Agency in order for subordinated debt to count towards meeting the balance sheet equity requirement. Balance sheet equity will be determined based upon current and projected borrower financial statements. A balance sheet as of loan closing is required and should reflect the new debt and use of proceeds. If there are multiple borrowers, consolidated financial statements should be presented. The following capital and equity requirements must be met at the time of lender's closing of the guaranteed loan.

      (1) Existing businesses must meet one of the following requirements:

      (i) A minimum of 10 percent balance sheet equity (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan), or a maximum debt-to-balance sheet equity ratio of 9 to 1, at loan closing;

      (ii) A 10 percent or more of total eligible project costs, borrower investment of equity or other funds into the project including grants or subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan;

      (iii) Owner contributed capital, as reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet, that is equal to or greater than 10 percent of net total fixed assets plus depreciation.

      (2) New businesses with sales contract(s) with proceeds in an amount adequate to meet debt service and the term of the sales contract(s) are at least equal to the term of the guaranteed loan, and subject to Agency acceptance of the credit worthiness of the counterparty, the borrower must meet one of the following requirements:

      (i) A minimum of 10 percent balance sheet equity (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan), or a maximum debt-to-balance sheet equity ratio of 9 to 1 at loan closing; or

      (ii) Borrower investment of equity or other funds (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan and grants) into the project in an amount of 10 percent or more of total eligible project cost;

      (3) New businesses with a project involving construction and when the lender will request the loan note guarantee prior to completion of construction must meet one of the following requirements:

      (i) A minimum of 25 percent balance sheet equity (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan), or a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 3 to 1, at guaranteed loan closing; or

      (ii) Borrower investment of equity or other funds (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan and grants) into the project in an amount of 25 percent or more of total eligible project cost;

      (4) All other borrowers that are new businesses must meet one of the following requirements:

      (i) A minimum of 20 percent balance sheet equity (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan), or a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 4 to 1, at guaranteed loan closing, or;

      (ii) Borrower investment of equity or other funds (including subordinated debt when subject to a standstill agreement for the life of the loan and grants) into the project in an amount of 25 percent or more of total eligible project cost;

      (5) Variances in capital and equity requirements:

      (i)  The Agency may increase the capital or equity requirement specified under paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section for guaranteed loans the Agency determines carry a higher risk. In determining whether a project or guaranteed loan carries a higher risk, the Agency will consider the current status of the industry, concentration of the industry in the Agency's portfolio, collateral coverage, value of personal or corporate guarantees, cash flow, and contractual relationships with suppliers and buyers; credit rating of the borrower; and the strength of the feasibility study and experience of management. The Agency may also increase the capital or equity requirement for new businesses using integrated processing equipment and systems such as biorefineries, renewable energy systems, chemical manufacturing facilities, and businesses producing new products to sell into new and emerging markets.

      (ii)  The Agency may reduce the minimum equity requirement for an existing business when personal or corporate guarantees are obtained in accordance with § 5001.204 of this part; and all pro forma statements indicate the business to be financed meets or exceeds the median quartile (as identified in the Risk Management Association's Annual Statement Studies or similar publication) for the current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-worth ratio, and debt service coverage ratio.

      (6) Certification: The lender must certify that, as of the date the guaranteed Loan was closed, its credit analysis indicated that the borrower had sufficient capital or equity to mitigate the financial and operational risks of the business, and that the borrower met the minimum equity required by the Agency in its conditional commitment, or that the minimum borrower capital contribution toward project costs, as applicable and required by the Agency, was met.

      § 5001.106   Eligible REAP—Renewable Energy System (RES) projects and requirements.

#### § § 5001.106

      For a REAP RES project to be eligible for a loan guarantee under this part, it must meet the criteria specified in § 5001.102(a) through (c) and in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and be for a borrower eligible to submit an application for the project in accordance with § 5001.126.

      (a) The project must be for—

      (1) The purchase of a new or existing RES;

      (2) The purchase of a refurbished RES; or

      (3) The retrofitting of an existing RES.

      (4) For the purposes of this section, only those hydroelectric sources with a rated power of 30 megawatts or less are an eligible RES.

      (b) The RES project must use commercially available technology.

      (c) The RES project must be located in a rural area unless the borrower is an agricultural producer and the application supports the production, processing, vertical integration, or marketing of agricultural products. If the agricultural producer's operation is in a non-rural area, then the application can only be for RES components that are:

      (1) Directly related to, and their use and purpose is limited to the agricultural production operation, such as vertically integrated operations; and

      (2) Part of and co-located with the agricultural production operation.

      (d) Where a residence is closely associated with an agricultural operation or rural small business to be served by the RES project, 50 percent or more of the energy to be generated by the RES project must be used by the agricultural operation or rural small business. This provision must be documented with the application and can be demonstrated using either of the methods identified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

      (1) Provide a renewable energy site assessment or other documentation and calculations that demonstrate based on historical energy use that 50 percent or more of the energy to be produced by the RES project will be used in the agricultural operation or rural small business. This includes documentation on historical residential energy use. The Agency may request additional data to determine residential versus business or agricultural operation usage. The actual percentage of energy determined to benefit the rural small business or agricultural operation will be the basis to determine eligible project costs.

      (2) The borrower may install or elect to conditionalize funding upon the installation of a device (such as a second meter) that results in 100 percent of the energy generated by the RES project to be used only by the agricultural operation or rural small business.

      (e) The RES project must have technical merit. The Agency will use the information provided in the technical report submitted with the application (see § 5001.307(e) of this part) to determine if the project has technical merit. In making this determination, the Agency may engage the services of other Government agencies or other recognized industry experts in the applicable technology field, at its discretion, to evaluate the technical report.

      (1)  When making its technical merit determination, the Agency will evaluate the technical report using the areas specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section as applicable.

      (i)  For these projects, the Agency will evaluate the following areas in making the technical merit determination:

      (A) Project description;

      (B) Resource assessment;

      (C) Project economic assessment; and

      (D) Qualifications of key service providers.

      (ii)  For these projects, the Agency will evaluate the following areas in making the technical merit determination:

      (A) Project description;

      (B) Resource assessment;

      (C) Project economic assessment;

      (D) Project construction and equipment; and

      (E) Qualifications of key service providers.

      (iii)  For these projects, the Agency will evaluate the following areas in making the technical merit determination:

      (A) Qualifications of the project team;

      (B) Agreements and permits;

      (C) Resource assessment;

      (D) Design and engineering;

      (E) Project development;

      (F) Equipment procurement and installation; and

      (G) Operations and maintenance.

      (2)  The Agency will assign each area of the technical report, as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a “pass,” “pass with conditions,” or “fail.” An area will receive a “pass” if the information provided for the area has no weaknesses and meets or exceeds any requirements specified for the area. An area will receive a “pass with conditions” if the information provided for the area has minor weaknesses which could be conditioned and reasonably resolved by the borrower. Otherwise, if the information provided for the area is conclusively deemed to be a major weakness, or if the area has not been addressed by the applicant, the area will receive a fail.

      (3)  The Agency will compile the results for each area of the technical report to determine if the project has technical merit.

      (i) A project whose technical report receives a “pass” in each of the applicable areas will be considered to have “technical merit.”

      (ii) A project whose technical report receives a “pass with conditions” in one or more the applicable areas will be considered to have “conditional technical merit.”

      (iii) A project whose technical report receives a “fail” in any one area will be considered to be “without technical merit.”

      (4)  A project that is determined to have “technical merit” or “conditional technical merit” is eligible for further consideration for funding. Projects with “conditional technical merit” would be subject to funding conditions that would need to be met to ensure full technical merit prior to completion of the project. A project that is determined to be “without technical merit” is not eligible to compete for funding.

However, acquisition or change of ownership between existing owners is an eligible use of loan funds when the remaining owner(s) held their ownership and actively participated in the business operation for at least the past 24 months and the selling owner will not retain any ownership interest in the business directly or indirectly including through other entities or trusts or property rights.

      (3) Purchase of machinery and equipment.

      (4) Startup costs, working capital, inventory, and supplies in the form of a permanent working capital term loan.

      (5) Pollution control and abatement.

      (6) Takeout of interim financing: Guaranteeing a loan that provides for permanent, long-term financing after project completion to pay off a lender's interim loan will not be treated as debt refinancing provided that the lender submits a complete request for preliminary eligibility review or complete application that proposes such interim financing prior to closing the interim loan. The borrower must take no action until the conclusion of the environmental review process prior to any action that would have an adverse effect on the environment or limit the choices of any reasonable alternatives to be considered by the Agency. Interim financing is typically used to pay costs associated with a planned project, such as construction or installation of equipment, however, the Agency will consider, on a case-by-case basis, other reasons to use interim financing. The term for interim financing loans should be for the construction period plus a reasonable time for the business to begin generation of working capital to amortize the loan. Guaranteed promissory notes that do not convert the interim financing payment schedule to an amortizing permanent schedule in the same note are not allowed. In certain cases, the applicant lender may use interim financing to pay-off a borrower's maturing loan with another lender if it is in the best interests of the borrower. The takeout of interim financing is only eligible when the permanent loan on which the guarantee will be placed takes out the interim financing that financed the planned project and when the lender submits a complete preliminary eligibility review or application to the Agency that proposes the interim financing prior to closing the interim loan. If the interim financing does not meet these requirements, it is considered debt refinancing and must comply with § 5001.102(d). If the guarantee is issued prior to construction, the promissory note must contain and convert the terms of the interim financing to permanent financing. The Agency will not guarantee takeout of interim financing loans that prevent a meaningful environmental assessment prior to Agency loan approval. Even for projects with interim financing, the Agency cannot approve the loan nor issue a conditional commitment until the environmental process is complete. The Agency assumes no responsibility or obligation for interim loans.

      (7) Guarantee fees, as determined under § 5001.454.

      (8) Lender fees, as determined under § 5001.403.

      (9) Professional service fees and charges, provided the Agency approves the amounts as reasonable and customary in the area and fees for construction permits and licenses.

      (10) Feasibility studies and business plans.

      (11) Interest (including interest on interim financing) during the period before the first principal payment becomes due or when the facility becomes income producing, whichever is earlier.

      (12) Refinancing in accordance with § 5001.102(d).

      (d)  Guaranteed loan funds for a project receiving a loan guarantee under REAP may be used to pay the expenses associated with the items identified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (14) of this section, provided such items are directly related to and their use and purpose are limited to the RES, EEI, or EEE project. The expenses associated with the items specified in paragraphs (d)(8) through (11) of this section cannot exceed more than ten percent of the loan amount. Ten percent is an aggregate amount, not ten percent for each item.

      (1) Purchase and installation of new or refurbished RES.

      (2) Purchase and installation of energy efficient equipment and systems by eligible agricultural producers.

      (3) Construction, retrofitting, replacement, and improvements.

      (4) Energy efficiency improvements (EEI) identified by vendor/installer certification or in the applicable energy assessment or energy audit.

      (5) Fees for construction permits and licenses, including fees required by an interconnection agreement.

      (6) Guarantee fees, as determined under § 5001.454.

      (7) Professional service fees and charges related to the project, which may include non-deferred developer fees, provided the Agency approves the amounts as reasonable and customary in the area.

      (8) Lender fees, as provided in § 5001.403.

      (9) Working capital, which may include interest on interim financing, debt reserves, rent payments, insurance, and packaging and origination fees.

      (10) Land acquisition.

      (11) Energy assessments, energy audits, technical reports, business plans, and feasibility studies completed and acceptable to the Agency, provided no portion was financed by any other Federal or State grant or payment assistance, including, but not limited to, a REAP energy audit or renewable energy development assistance grant.

      (12) For an eligible RES project in which a residence is closely associated with the rural small business or agricultural operation, the installation of a second meter to separate the residence from the portion of the project that benefits the rural small business or agricultural operation, as applicable.

      (13) Land, building, and equipment for an existing RES.

      (14) Refinancing outstanding long-term debt. It is not considered refinancing if loans were structured as construction or bridge loans for short-term financing needs (interim financing) in preparation for a long-term loan. Refinancing will be considered when—

      (i) The original purpose of the debt being refinanced meets the eligible project requirements of § 5001.106, § 5001.107 or § 5001.108, as applicable, of this part;

      (ii) Debt being refinanced does not exceed 50 percent of the total use of funds in the new REAP guaranteed loan;

      (iii) Refinancing is necessary to improve cash flow and viability of the project;

      § 5001.122   Ineligible uses of loan funds.

#### § § 5001.122

      Projects that receive a loan guarantee under this part cannot use the guaranteed loan funds for those expenses or purposes identified in paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section and for any other item the Agency identifies in accordance with § 5001.10.

      (a) Payment in excess of actual costs ( profit, overhead, indirect costs, and wages to owners) incurred by the contractor or other service provider on a contract or agreement that has been entered into at less than an arm's length transaction or has a potential for a conflict of interest. In situations where there is common ownership or an otherwise closely related company is being paid to do construction or installation work for a borrower, only documented costs associated with the construction or installation can be paid with guaranteed loan funds and cannot include any profit or wages to such related person.

      (b) Notwithstanding § 5001.102(d), payment on any other Federal loan or debt.

      (c) Payment of a Federal judgment, State or Federal tax lien, or other debt owed to the United States.

      (d) Loan finder or broker fees.

      (e) Refinancing debt that is owned by a loan packager or broker or their respective affiliates.

      (f) For loans as specified under CF and WWD, costs normally provided by a business or industrial user ( wastewater pretreatment).

      (g) For loans as specified under CF and WWD, any portion of the cost of a project that does not serve a rural area.

      (h) Rental for the use of equipment or machinery owned by the borrower.

      (i) For purposes not directly related to operating and maintaining the project.

      (j) Any EEI not identified in the applicable energy assessment or energy audit.

      (k) Agricultural tillage equipment, used equipment, and vehicles are ineligible for loans as specified under REAP. Costs include costs for RES and/or EEI projects that are used to improve a vehicle's ability to propel itself are ineligible uses for loan funds. For example, modifying an existing vehicle's engine to run on renewable fuels or replacing an older vehicle with a new more efficient vehicle are ineligible uses of loan funds. Projects similar to purchasing and installing solar panels to power a refrigerator or the replacement of a refrigerator for a more efficient one on a food truck may be considered eligible uses of loan funds if all other borrower and project eligibility requirements are met.

      (l) Distribution or payment to an individual or entity that will retain an ownership interest in the borrower or distribution or payment to a beneficiary of the borrower. Distribution or payment to a member of the immediate family of an owner, partner, or stockholder will not be permitted, except for change in ownership interest and the Agency determines the price paid to be reasonable based upon an appraisal. This prohibition does not apply to transfers of ownership for ESOPs or worker cooperatives, to cooperatives where the cooperative pays the member for product or services, or where member stock is transferred among members of the cooperative in accordance with § 5001.140 of this part. This paragraph does not preclude the former owner from remaining an employee of the business during a reasonable transition period. The payment of personal debt is considered a distribution or payment to an owner, except for the refinancing of debt for an asset that is used in the business when the owner is a co-borrower on the loan.

      (m) For loans as specified under CF, initial operating expenses, short-term, working capital or operating loans; or annual recurring costs, including purchases or rentals that are generally considered to be operating and maintenance expenses.

      (n) Lease payments, including lease to own or capitalized leases. This does not preclude a REAP applicant from leasing out REAP financed and installed equipment to a third party (lessee) such as a non-profit, school district, or municipal government. The third party (lessee) must directly utilize the equipment to fulfill the statutory purposes of REAP, to generate renewable energy or provide energy savings. The borrower must maintain ownership and control of the project for the entire useful life of the project, including site, income and expenses via the lease agreement. Additionally, all other REAP requirements, must be reviewed in this scenario to ensure complete eligibility is obtained with a lease in place. This includes, but is not limited to, project eligibility, including prohibitions on residential use and other prescribed eligible project costs. A REAP applicant may lease out a commercial building, improved with REAP funds, to various tenants. This may include an office complex in which a Federal Government Agency is a tenant. This is allowable as long as conflict of interest requirements are complied with.

      §§ 5001.123-5001.125   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 5001.123-5001.125

      § 5001.126   Borrower eligibility.

#### § § 5001.126

      To be eligible for a loan guarantee under this part, a borrower must meet the requirements specified in this section at the time of each guaranteed loan's approval and through issuance of the loan note guarantee. A borrower must meet the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and in paragraphs (b) through (e), as applicable, of this section.

      (a)  The borrower must have, or obtain before issuance of the loan note guarantee, the legal authority necessary to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facility and services and to obtain, give security for, and repay the proposed loan.

      (1)  The borrower is responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility and providing for its continued availability and use. The borrower will retain this responsibility even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract, management agreement, or written lease. Leases may be used for certain projects when they are the only feasible way to provide the service or facility, are the customary practice to provide such service or facility within the industry or in the State and provide for the borrower's management control of the project. Contracts, management agreements, or written leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership unless approved by the Agency. The borrower must own and retain control of the facility at all times; however, various types of ownership structures are permitted to bring in passive investor equity. These include but are not limited to partnership flips and inverted leases, which are common in the renewable energy industry. The anticipated release of passive tax credit investor entities resulting in a change in ownership control that does not impact the financial performance of the loan, as outlined at time of loan closing, does not constitute a transfer or assumption, nor require concurrence from the Agency.

      (2)  Except for CF guaranteed loans in situations where any business or affiliate is dependent upon another's operations and are effectively one business or rely upon one another for loan repayment, they must be co-borrowers, unless waived by the Agency in writing when the Agency determines that adequate justification exists to not require the entities to be co-borrowers. Both co-borrowers must meet all requirements in this part. If the operating entity is truly independent and not reliant on another operation to remain viable or repay the debt, the Agency will allow one entity to be the sole borrower.

      (b)  To be eligible for a loan guarantee under CF, a borrower must meet the requirements identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

      (1)  Be a public body, including Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribes, or non-profit organization.

      (i) Borrowers organized under the applicable State or Tribal for-profit corporation laws may be eligible if they will be operated on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the guaranteed loan;

      (ii) Single member not-for-profit corporations or not-for-profit corporations owned or substantially controlled by other corporations or associations are eligible if the member organization has significant ties with the project service area and provides a payment guarantee.

      (2)  Have significant ties with the project service area (not applicable to public bodies and federally recognized Tribes) as evidenced by the following:

      (i) Association with or control by a public body or bodies typically evidenced in the organizational documents of the borrower; or

      (ii) Broadly based membership and controlled primarily by members residing in the project service area. Membership must be open without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, or marital or familial status.

      (3)  In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1983, certify in writing, subject to Agency verification, that the borrower is unable to finance the proposed project from their own resources or through commercial credit without a guarantee, at reasonable rates and terms. A loan guarantee will not be provided to borrowers who are able to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance project costs at reasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates and terms in the community in or near where the borrower resides, for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, or to borrowers who are able to finance project costs from their own resources.

      (4)  In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2009h, the evidence shall be in the form of a certification of support for the project from each affected local government. The certification of support should include sufficient information to determine that the essential community facility will provide needed services to the community or communities and will have no adverse impact on other community facilities providing similar services.

      (c)  To be eligible for a loan guarantee under WWD, a borrower must meet the requirements identified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.

      (1)  Be a public body, including Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other Federally recognized Indian tribes, or non-profit organization.

      (2)  In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1983, certify in writing, subject to Agency verification, that the borrower is unable to finance the proposed project from their own resources or through commercial credit without a guarantee, at reasonable rates and terms. A loan guarantee will not be provided to borrowers who are able to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance project costs at reasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates and terms in the community in or near where the borrower resides, for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, or to borrowers who are able to finance project costs from their own resources. All lenders are required to provide written certification that their borrowers are unable to afford commercial credit at reasonable rates and terms without the guarantee.

      (3)  In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2009h, the evidence shall be in the form of a certification of support for the project from each affected local government.

      (d)  To be eligible for a loan guarantee under B&I, a borrower must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4), as applicable, of this section.

      (1) The borrower must be:

      (i) A cooperative, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity organized and operated on a profit or nonprofit basis;

      (ii) An Indian Tribe

      (iii) A Public Body; or

      (iv) An individual.

      (2) The borrower must be engaged in or proposing to engage in a business. A business may include manufacturing, wholesaling, retailing, providing services, or other activities that will provide employment or improve the economic or environmental climate in rural communities.

      (i) Be a citizen of the United States;

      (ii) Reside in the United States after being legally admitted for permanent residence and must provide a permanent green card as evidence of eligibility; or

      (iii) Be a citizen or resident of the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

      (4) A borrower must demonstrate, to the Agency's satisfaction, that guaranteed loan funds will remain in the United States and the project being financed will primarily create new or save existing jobs for rural U.S. residents. To ensure that loan funds remain in the United States, loans must be collateralized with fixed assets that remain in the United States.

      (e)  To be eligible for a loan guarantee under REAP, a borrower must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.

      (1)  The borrower must be either an agricultural producer or a rural small business if applying for RES or EEI funding. The borrower must be an agricultural producer if applying for EEE funding. For-profit rural small businesses that provide long-term care services that benefit residents, such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities, are eligible. For-profit rural small businesses that provide short-term housing, such as hotels, are also eligible. Newly formed special purpose entities or equivalents that are clearly created solely for the circumvention of provisions prohibited by REAP statute are not eligible.

      (2)  The borrower at the time of application or no later than guaranteed loan closing and for the term of the guaranteed loan must:

      (i) Own the project; and

      (ii) Own or control the site for the project at the time of application and for the term of the guaranteed loan.

      (3)  If the controlling interest in the applicant entity is otherwise eligible as an applicant and a legal transaction between two parties for the sale of energy in an open market is being proposed, the Agency will not consider the energy end-users as part of the analysis of the eligibility of the applicant. However, if the proposed end-user would be an ineligible applicant, such as an entity which is residential in nature or a non-profit entity, and the REAP applicant entity is a newly formed special-purpose entity with substantially the same ownership as the proposed end-user, then the REAP applicant entity is not eligible.

      (4)  The borrower must have available or be able to demonstrate, at the time of application, satisfactory sources of revenue in an amount sufficient to provide for the operation, management, maintenance, and any debt service of the project for the term of the loan. In addition, the borrower must control the revenues and expenses of the project, including its operation and maintenance. The borrower may employ a qualified consultant under contract to manage revenues and expenses of the project and its operation and/or maintenance.

      (5)  The borrower must demonstrate evidence of injection of matching funds in the project of not less than 25 percent of total eligible project costs. Passive third-party contributions are acceptable as matching funds for RES projects, including those raised from the sale of Federal tax credits.

      § 5001.127   Borrower ineligibility conditions.

#### § § 5001.127

      A potential borrower is ineligible for a guaranteed loan under this part as identified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. The borrower remains ineligible until the condition causing ineligibility is resolved.

      (a) An entity is ineligible if any of the conditions identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section applies to the borrower, any owner with more than 20 percent ownership interest in the borrower (does not include passive investors), or any owner with control of the borrower. Entities with delinquent debt, as identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4), under a repayment plan are not eligible until the debt is paid in full.

      (1) There is an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other than U.S. Tax Court).

      (2) Delinquency on the payment of Federal income taxes.

      (3) Delinquency on Federal debt.

      (4) Debarment or suspension from receiving Federal assistance. The lender is responsible for verification of the borrower's status. Verification can be done at

      (b) An entity is ineligible if it derives more than 15 percent of its annual gross revenue (including any lease income from space or machines) from gambling activity, excluding State-authorized lottery proceeds or Tribal-authorized gaming proceeds, as approved by the Agency, conducted for the purpose of raising funds for the approved project.

      (c) An entity is ineligible if it derives income from activities of a prurient sexual nature.

      (d) An entity is ineligible if it derives income from illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, or any other illegal product or activity as defined under Federal statute. A borrower that intends to lease space or enter into a power purchase agreement with a marijuana dispensary is not eligible given our borrower would be receiving income from the marijuana operation which is a violation of Federal laws as marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal law and subject to Federal prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).

      (e) An entity is ineligible under B&I projects if it is a charitable or fraternal organization. For purposes of this section, an organization that derives more than 10 percent of its annual gross revenue from tax deductible charitable donations, based on historical financial statements, is considered a charitable organization.

      (f) An entity is ineligible if its lender or any of the lender's officers has an ownership interest in the borrower or is an officer or director of the borrower with management control or where the borrower or any of its officers, directors, stockholders, or other owners have more than a five percent ownership interest in the lender. Any of the lender's directors, stockholders, or other owners that are officers, directors, stockholders, or other owners of the borrower without management control or ownership less than 5 percent must be recused from any decision-making process associated with the guaranteed loan.

      (g) A borrower is ineligible if it is a lending institution, investment institution, or insurance company with exception of REAP or projects for a fund that invests primarily in cooperatives in accordance with § 5001.140, and NMTC projects in accordance with § 5001.141.

      (x) Its lending policies including underwriting standards, credit analysis policies and procedures, and its problem credit management policies and procedures.

      (xi) A third-party external loan origination, lending portfolio, and management review acceptable to the Agency conducted in the previous two years, or a copy of a credit examination less than two years old conducted under an approved credit examination criterion such as CAMELS.

      (3)  The Agency will notify the non-regulated lending entity whether its request to become a lender is approved or rejected. If the Agency rejects the request, the Agency will include in the notification the reason(s) for the rejection.

      (4)  To maintain its status as an approved lender, the non-regulated lending entity must submit a written request to the Agency for renewal of its approved lender status at least 60, but not more than 120, calendar days prior to the expiration of the existing lender's agreement to be assured of a timely renewal. A review of the lender's performance will be completed to determine whether the lender has continually met the eligibility criteria described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The lender's activity in the program and its delinquency/default rate will also be considered when making a determination regarding renewal. Any action by the lender since it was designated an eligible lender that could be cause for revoking its status, in accordance with § 5001.132, will be considered cause for denying the renewal of eligible status. The lender will be notified in writing whether the request is approved, reasons for denial, or any conditions the lender must meet for approval. The lender's written request must provide the information specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (iii) through (v) of this section; and

      (i) A written update of any change in the persons designated to process and service Agency guaranteed loans or change in the operating methods used in the processing and servicing of loans since the original or last renewal date of lender status.

      (ii) A description of how the lender is complying with each of the required criteria described in (c)(1) of this section and § 5001.501.

      (iii) A new executed lender's agreement.

      (iv) The Agency may require lenders with limited guaranteed loan activity over the previous five years, or a lender that has originated guaranteed loans with servicing issues or a loss to the Agency, to resubmit all the information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A lender who is not active in the Agency guaranteed loan programs should provide evidence that they remain active in other commercial lending activity with acceptable underwriting and servicing performance. Lenders with loans that cause a loss to the Agency are a concern and those projects will be reviewed to determine the cause of the loss, including whether the lender's analysis or servicing processes were insufficient.

      (v) The renewal will be for a term of 5 years.

      (d)  The Agency may approve a lending entity serving tribal trust lands that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to become a lender for a five-year period. A non-regulated lending entity approved to originate and service guaranteed loans for projects located only on tribal trust lands is restricted to such areas. To make and service guaranteed loans not on tribal trust lands, the lending entity must meet the criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. When the lending entity is a multi-tiered entity, the Agency will consider the lending entity in its entirety for approval.

      (1)  To be approved as a lender, a non-regulated lending entity serving only tribal trust lands must—

      (i) Have the legal authority necessary to operate a lending program to borrowers located on tribal trust lands.

      (ii) Meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and prove to be a financially sound institution, as determined by the Agency, on a case by case basis, based on the Agency's risk assessment of the lending entity's capital, adequate liquidity, management capabilities, repayment ability, credit underwriting, balance sheet equity and other financial factors as determined appropriate. On a case-by-case basis, the Agency may reduce the loan origination requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for lenders serving only projects located on tribal trust lands.

      (2)  A non-regulated lending entity serving Tribal trust lands that seeks to become a lender must submit a written request to the Agency via  that includes the following information:

      (i) Documentation required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

      (ii) Written certification that the lender intends to only originate guaranteed loans under the regulation for projects located in certain (or specified) tribal lands held in trust for tribes and for tribal members not in such tribal lands but are in their service area;

      (iii) Bylaws; and

      (iv) Lending experience of management and loan officers, including staff organizational chart, including names and titles for senior staff.

      (3)  The Agency will notify the non-regulated lending entity servicing tribal trust land whether its request to become a lender is approved or rejected. If the Agency rejects the request, the Agency will include in the notification the reason(s) for the rejection.

      (4)  To maintain its status as an approved lender, the non-regulated lending entity serving Tribal trust land must submit a written request to the Agency for renewal of its approved lender status at least 60 and not more than 120 calendar days prior to the expiration of the existing lender's agreement to be assured of a timely renewal. A review of the lender's performance will be completed to determine whether the lender has continually met the eligibility criteria described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The lender's activity in the program and its delinquency/default rate will also be considered when making a determination regarding renewal. Any action by the lender since it was designated an eligible lender that could be cause for revoking its status, in accordance with § 5001.132, will be considered cause for denying the renewal of eligible status. The lender will be notified in writing whether the request is approved, reasons for denial, or any conditions the lender must meet for approval. The lender's written request must provide the information specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (iii) through (v) of this section; and

      (i) A written update of any change in the persons designated to process and service Agency guaranteed loans or change in the operating methods used in the processing and servicing of loans since the original or last renewal date of lender status.

      (ii) A description of how the lender is complying with each of the required criteria described in (c)(1) of this section and § 5001.501.

      (iii) A new executed lender's agreement.

      (iv) The Agency may require lender with limited guaranteed loan activity over the previous five years, or a lender that has originated guaranteed loans with servicing issues or a loss to the Agency, to submit updated information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (v) The renewal will be for a term of 5 years.

      (e) Previously approved lenders. Lenders that have been previously approved by the Agency under one of the guaranteed loan programs identified in § 5001.1(b)(1) through (4) of this part cannot originate new guaranteed loans after the effective date of this rule unless the lender is approved under the applicable conditions of paragraphs (a) through (d), as applicable, of this section.

      § 5001.131   Lender's agreement.

#### § § 5001.131

      When approved to participate as a lender under this part, the lender must execute a lender's agreement before the Agency will issue a loan note guarantee. A new lender's agreement must be executed with any existing lender making new loans on or after October 1, 2020. Approval under one program is approval for all programs. The eligibility expiration date for non-regulated lenders will be five years from the date of the original execution of a lender's agreement as specified in § 5001.130(c) and (d). There will be only one lender's agreement issued for each lending entity based on their tax identification number. Lender's agreements will not be issued for individual branches. Subsequent loans do not require a new lender's agreement. A lender who fails to renew its lender's agreement and loses its approved lender status must continue to service any outstanding guaranteed loans in conformance with the lender's agreement last in effect and the applicable regulation under which the lender became an approved lender. Such lenders cannot submit requests for new loan guarantees.

      § 5001.132   Maintenance of approved lender status.

#### § § 5001.132

      Continuation of approved lender status under this part is not automatic. Lenders may lose their approved lender status as described in paragraph (a) of this section. The Agency may also revoke a lender's status as an approved lender or debar the approved lender, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (a)  A lender will lose its approved status if it—

      (1) Fails to conform with the provisions of this part or the applicable guaranteed loan program identified in § 5001.1 of this part;

      (4) Is a non-regulated lending entity and fails to renew its approval status within 5 years of the expiration date of the lender's agreement.

      (b)  The Agency can revoke a lender's status as an approved lender at any time for cause as specified in the lender's agreement. A decision to revoke a lender's approved status will be made by the Agency and the lender will be notified in writing. The revocation may apply to all branches of the lender, specific branches, or personnel, as appropriate. The lender must revoke the level II eAuthentication privileges of all individuals included in the revocation notice. Cause for revoking lender status includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the circumstances identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (14) of this section.

      (1) Guaranteed loans originated by the lender cause substantial financial loss to the Agency.

      (2) Failure to maintain status as an approved lender under the applicable regulations in effect when the lender obtained approved lender status. For lenders approved under this part, this means maintaining compliance with the requirements set forth in § 5001.130.

      (3) Conviction of the lender or any of its officers for criminal acts in connection with any loan transaction, whether or not the loan was guaranteed by the Agency.

      (4) Violation of usury laws in connection with any loan transaction whether or not the loan was guaranteed by the Agency.

      (12) Violation of any term of the lender's agreement.

      (13) Failure to submit reports required by the Agency in a timely manner.

      (14) Violation of applicable nondiscrimination laws, including, but not limited to, statutes, regulations, USDA Departmental Regulations, the USDA Non-Discrimination Statement, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. USDA's Non-Discrimination Statement is located on the Agency's website, see  In addition to revoking the lender's status, the Agency may debar the lender in compliance with 2 CFR part 180.

      (c)  Any lender who loses its status as an approved lender under any of the conditions identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must reapply under the provisions of § 5001.130 to be reinstated as an approved lender. A lender who loses its approved lender status must continue to service any outstanding guaranteed loans in conformance with the lender's agreement last in effect and the applicable regulation under which the lender became an approved lender. In addition, such lenders cannot submit requests for new loan guarantees.

      §§ 5001.133-5001.139   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 5001.133-5001.139

      § 5001.140   Cooperative stock/cooperative equity.

#### § § 5001.140

      Loan guarantees described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are only available under B&I guaranteed loans.

      (a)  The Agency may guarantee loans for the purchase of cooperative stock by individual farmers or ranchers in a farmer or rancher cooperative established for the purpose of processing an agricultural commodity. The cooperative may contract for services to process agricultural commodities or otherwise process value-added agricultural products during the five-year period beginning on the operation startup date of the cooperative in order to provide adequate time for the planning and construction of the processing facility of the cooperative.

      (1) The proceeds from the stock sale may be used to recapitalize, to develop a new processing facility or product line, or to expand an existing production facility. Guaranteed loan funds must remain in the cooperative from which stock was purchased, and the cooperative must not reinvest those funds into another entity.

      (2) The maximum guaranteed loan amount is $600,000 and all applications will be processed in accordance with §§ 5001.301 through 5001.303, 5001.306, 5001.315, and 5001.318 of this part, as applicable.

      (3) The maximum term of the guaranteed loan is seven years when the proceeds from the stock sale are used by the cooperative to recapitalize or are used for working capital. The maximum term allowable for final guaranteed loan maturity is limited to the justified useful life of the assets the cooperative purchases with the proceeds of the stock sale not to exceed 40 years or applicable State statutory limitations, whichever is less.

      (4) The lender will, at a minimum, obtain a valid lien on the stock, an assignment of any patronage refund, and the ability to transfer the stock to another party, or any other right or ability necessary to liquidate and dispose of the collateral in the event of a default by the borrower. The lender and borrower understand that the borrower is fully liable for the entire debt, regardless of the success or failure of the cooperative. The lender is expected to maximize recovery on the loan, including collection of personal, partnership and corporate guarantees. In addition, provisions of the DCIA may impose significant restrictions on delinquent Federal debtors, including eligibility for other Federal programs.

      (5) The lender must complete a written credit evaluation of each stock purchase loan and a complete credit evaluation of the cooperative prior to making its first stock purchase loan.

      (6) The borrower may provide financial information in the manner that is generally required by commercial agricultural lenders.

      (7) A feasibility study of the cooperative is required for startup cooperatives and may be required by the Agency for existing cooperatives when the cooperative's operations will be significantly affected by the proceeds that were generated from the stock sale.

      (8) The Agency will conduct an appropriate environmental review on the processing facility and will not process individual applications for the purchase of stock until the environmental review on the cooperative processing facility is completed.

      (b)  The Agency may also guarantee loans for the purchase of transferable stock shares of any type of existing cooperative, which would primarily involve new or incoming members. Such stock may provide delivery or some form of participation rights and may only be traded among cooperative members. The lender and borrower understand that the borrower is fully liable for the entire debt, regardless of the success or failure of the ESOP. The lender is expected to maximize recovery on the loan, including collection of personal, partnership and corporate guarantees. In addition, provisions of the DCIA may impose significant restrictions on delinquent Federal debtors, including eligibility for other Federal programs.

      (1) The maximum loan amount is $600,000 and all applications will be processed in accordance with §§ 5001.301 through 5001.303, 5001.306, 5001.315, and 5001.318 of this part, as applicable.

      (2) The maximum term of the loan is seven years.

      (3) The lender will, at a minimum, obtain a valid lien on the stock, an assignment of any patronage refund, and the ability to transfer the stock to another party, or any other right or ability necessary to liquidate and dispose of the collateral in the event of a default by the borrower.

      (4) The lender must complete a written credit evaluation of each stock purchase loan and a complete credit evaluation of the cooperative prior to making its first stock purchase loan.

      (c)  The Agency may guarantee loans for the purchase of preferred stock or similar equity issued by a cooperative or may guarantee loans to a fund that invests primarily in cooperatives. In either case, the project must significantly benefit one or more entities eligible for assistance under B&I guaranteed loans.

      (1) “Similar equity” is any special class of equity stock that is available for purchase by non-members and/or members and lacks voting and other governance rights.

      (2) A fund that invests “primarily” in cooperatives is determined by its percentage share of investments in and loans to cooperatives. A fund portfolio must have at least 50 percent of its loans and investments in cooperatives to be considered eligible for loan guarantees for the purchase of preferred stock or similar equity.

      (3) The principal amount of the guaranteed loan cannot exceed $10 million.

      (4) The maximum term of the guaranteed loan is seven years when the proceeds are used by the cooperative for working capital and;

      (i) In all other cases the maximum term of the guaranteed loan is equal to the lesser of the following but not exceeding 40 years:

      (ii) The justified useful life of the funded project assets,

      (iii) The maximum term under any applicable State statute; or

      (iv) The specified holding period for redemption as stated by the stock offering.

      (5) All borrowers purchasing preferred stock or similar equity must provide documentation of the terms of the offering that includes compliance with State and Federal securities laws and financial information about the issuer of the preferred stock to both the lender and the Agency.

      (6) Issuer(s) of preferred stock must be a cooperative organization and must be able to issue preferred stock to the public that, if required, complies with State and Federal securities laws.

      (7) The lender will, at a minimum, obtain a valid lien on the preferred stock, an assignment of any patronage refund, and the ability to transfer the stock to another party, or otherwise liquidate and dispose of the collateral in the event of a default by a borrower. For the purpose of recovering losses from guaranteed loan defaults, lenders may take ownership of all equities purchased with such loans, including additional shares derived from reinvestment of dividends.

      (8) Shares of preferred stock that are purchased with guaranteed loan funds cannot be converted to common or voting stock.

      (9) In the absence of adequate provisions for investors' rights to early redemption of preferred stock or similar equity, a borrower must request from a cooperative or fund issuing such equities a contingent waiver of the holding or redemption period in advance of share purchases. This contingent waiver provides that in the event a default by a borrower on a B&I guaranteed loan, the borrower waives any ownership rights in the stock, and the lender and Agency will then have the right to redeem the stock.

      (10) Guaranteed loans for the purchase of preferred stock must be prepaid in the event a cooperative that issued the stock exercises an early redemption. If the cooperative enters into bankruptcy, to the extent the cooperative can redeem the preferred stock, the Borrower is required to repay the guaranteed loan from the redemption of the stock.

      (d)  The Agency may guarantee loans for conversions of businesses to either cooperatives or ESOP within five years from the date of initial transfer of stock.

      (1) The maximum loan amount is $600,000 and all applications will be processed in accordance with §§ 5001.301 through 5001.303, 5001.306, 5001.315, and 5001.318 of this part, as applicable.

      (2) The maximum term is 10 years.

      (3) The lender must, at a minimum, obtain a valid lien on the stock, an assignment of any patronage refund, and the ability to transfer the stock to another party, or otherwise liquidate and dispose of the collateral in the event of a default by a borrower. The lender and borrower understand that the borrower is fully liable for the entire debt, regardless of the success or failure of the cooperative or ESOP. The lender is expected to maximize recovery on the loan, including collection of personal, partnership and corporate guarantees. In addition, provisions of the DCIA may impose significant restrictions on delinquent Federal debtors, including eligibility for other Federal programs.

      (4) The lender must complete a written credit evaluation of each stock purchase loan and a complete credit evaluation of the cooperative or ESOP prior to making its first stock purchase loan.

      (5) If a cooperative is organized, each selling owner becomes a member with special control rights to protect their stake in the business while a succession plan is implemented. At the completion of the stock transfer, selling owners may retain their membership in the cooperative provided that their control rights are the same as all other members. Any special covenants that selling owners may have held must be extinguished upon completion of the transfer.

      (6) If an ESOP is organized for transferring ownership to employees, selling owner(s) may not retain ownership in the business after five years from the date of the initial transfer of stock.

      § 5001.141   New Markets Tax Credits Program.

#### § § 5001.141

      The New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) Program is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund with NMTC credits allocated to Treasury-certified Community Development Entities (CDE) across the United States to make Qualified Equity Investments (QEI) in low-income communities. NMTC related definitions and terms in this section are governed by section 45(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 45D), and applicable Treasury regulations (26 CFR 1.45D-1). A CDE will generally establish a new subsidiary of a CDE (sub-CDE) for individual NMTC projects. Lenders and their borrowers with guaranteed loan projects that include NMTC investments must comply with the provisions in this section. To be a lender for a guaranteed loan project that involves financing under the NMTC provisions, the lending entity must meet the applicable eligibility criteria in § 5001.130. The Agency will not waive its servicing rights to a guaranteed loan or be a party to any forbearance agreement in conjunction with a NMTC project. Requests for loan guarantees that include NMTC are subject to all applicable program eligibility requirements, credit analysis, and due diligence required by part 5001. In all cases the Agency will undertake efforts to protect the best financial interests of the Federal government and collection of its guaranteed loan. The Agency will not consider any tax benefit or loss of tax benefits to the CDE, sub-CDE or NMTC investor in the servicing actions of a guaranteed loan.

      (a)  (1) A lender that is CDE or sub-CDE under the direct control of a regulated lender or an approved non-regulated lender does not need to separately meet the requirements of § 5001.130 to make a guaranteed loan directly to a qualified active low-income community business (QALICB).

      (2) The provisions of § 5001.127(f) notwithstanding, a lender that is a CDE or sub-CDE may have an ownership interest in the borrower provided that each condition specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section is met.

      (i) The lender does not have an ownership interest in the borrower prior to the application.

      (ii) The lender does not take a controlling interest in the borrower.

      (iii) The lender does not provide equity or take an ownership interest in a borrower at a level that would result in the lender owning 20 percent or more interest in the borrower.

      (3) Notwithstanding § 5001.115(f), a lender that is a CDE or sub-CDE taking an ownership interest in the borrower does not constitute a conflict of interest. The Agency will mitigate the potential for a conflict of interest by requiring appropriate loan covenants establishing, at a minimum, limitations on dividends and distributions of earnings in the loan agreement between the lender and borrower. The Agency will also ensure that the lender limits any waivers of loan covenants and future modifications of loan documents in compliance with this part.

      (4) Guaranteed loans made by a lender directly to a QALICB must meet all other program and project eligibility requirements as specified in this part.

      (5) For purposes of calculating borrower equity in compliance with § 5001.105(d)(1), the CDE (or sub-CDE's) amount of the principal balance of the loan from NMTC investor funds that is subordinated to the guaranteed loan may be considered as equity.

      (b)  Tax benefits to a NMTC investor are based on the total amount of funds utilized in the project. The tax benefit calculation includes the sum of the investor's cash investment plus loan proceeds from a leveraged lender into a NMTC investor fund entity. The investor fund entity is generally a new entity established to make a qualified equity investment (QEI) into one or more CDEs or sub-CDEs to support a qualified low-income community investment (QLICI) to a QALICB. The investor fund entity, through its investment, has ownership rights in the sub-CDE that will be making secured QLICI loans to the QALICB. The provisions of § 5001.127(g) notwithstanding, either a leveraged lender entity lending to an investor fund entity, or an investor fund entity such as an investor partnership or investor limited liability corporation, may be an eligible borrower for a specific NMTC project as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of this section only, the stated term “borrower” in paragraphs (b)(1) through (13) of this section applies to both a leveraged lender entity or an investor fund entity as the guaranteed loan borrower in the NMTC project. Paragraphs (b)(2) through (13) of this section identify modifications to this part that apply when the eligible borrower is a leveraged lender entity or investor fund entity in a NMTC project.

      (1) To be an eligible borrower using the leveraged equity structure of a NMTC project each condition identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section must be met.

      (i) The investor fund entity must be established for a single specific NMTC investment.

      (ii) The lender is not an affiliate of the borrower.

      (iii) When the borrower is a leveraged lender entity it must relend one hundred percent of the guaranteed loan funds to an investor fund entity. In all cases one hundred percent of the guaranteed loan funds are or will be invested by the investment fund entity in one or more sub-CDEs that will then be loaned directly to a QALICB, as defined by applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, through a direct tracing method, and such guaranteed loan funds are, or will be used by the QALICB in accordance with the eligibility requirements in subpart B of this part. The QALICB's project must be the ultimate use of one hundred percent of the guaranteed loan funds.

      (iv) The QALICB must meet the requirements of an eligible borrower as found in § 5001.126.

      (v) The sub-CDE operating agreement with the QALICB must include a provision that the guaranteed lender has approval rights with respect to any substantial loan servicing actions that may be taken by the sub-CDE regarding the collateral or repayment terms of their QLICI loans to the QALICB.

      (2) The guaranteed loan amount and percentage of guarantee provisions found in §§ 5001.406 and 5001.407 of this part, respectively, apply to the QALICB and not to the investor fund entity or leveraged lender entity, who would actually be the borrower as defined under this part.

      (3) For purposes of calculating borrower equity in compliance with § 5001.105(d)(1), the leveraged lender entity's note from the investor fund may be considered a tangible asset and when the lien associated with the sub-CDE's loan is subordinated, the principal balance of the sub-CDE's loan made to the QALICB from NMTC investor funds may be considered as equity.

      (4) The loan terms found in § 5001.402 of this part apply to both the borrower and the QALICB. The maturity and related payment schedule of the lender's guaranteed loan to the borrower must be no longer than the maturity and related payment schedule of the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB. An Agency approved unequal or escalating schedule of principal and interest payments can be used for a NMTC loan. The lender may require additional principal repayment by a co-borrower, such as an owner or principal participant of the QALICB. The provisions of § 5001.402(b)(3) notwithstanding, the Agency may consider the payment of interest-only payments by a borrower pursuant to an interest-only term not to exceed seven years on a loan made under an NMTC structure if the lender requires:

      (i) A debt repayment reserve fund or sinking fund in an amount at least equal to the guaranteed loan's principal amortization that would have otherwise applied to the loan if equally amortized payments were collected during the seven-year term; and

      (ii) Such reserve funds or sinking funds are applied to the guaranteed loan as an additional payment of principal at the end of such interest-only term. The debt repayment reserve fund or sinking fund may be accumulated during the loan terms, or the full amount may be funded at loan closing.

      (5) Except for the collateral provisions, § 5001.202(b)(4), § 5001.202(b) of this part applies to both the lender's guaranteed loan to the borrower and the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB. The collateral provisions found in § 5001.202(b)(4) of this part apply only to the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB.

      (6) The personal, partnership and corporate guarantee provisions of § 5001.204 of this part apply when the guaranteed loan borrower is a leveraged lender entity in a NMTC project. Guaranteed loans made directly to an investor fund entity as the borrower do not require a personal, partnership, or corporate guarantee from the investor fund entity's owner, who is the NMTC tax credit investor and considered a passive investor. The Agency shall obtain the personal, partnership or corporate guarantee from the QALICB ownership for a guaranteed loan to an investor fund entity in compliance with § 5001.204, subject to the eligibility requirements of the NMTC program. The Agency may require additional personal, partnership or corporate guarantees if warranted by an Agency evaluation of potential financial risk. The QALICB is the ultimate user of the guaranteed loan funds, and their owners should provide a guarantee of the guaranteed loan as stipulated in § 5001.204.

      (7) The insurance provisions of § 5001.205(d) of this part apply only to the QALICB and the sub-CDE's secured loan to the QALICB.

      (8) The financial report provisions of § 5001.504 of this part apply to both the borrower and the QALICB.

#### § §§ 5001.142-5001.200

    Subpart C—Orgination Provisions

      § 5001.201   General origination requirements.

#### § § 5001.201

      The lender is responsible for originating a guaranteed loan in accordance with the requirements of this part and in accordance with its internal origination policies and procedures to the extent they do not conflict with the requirements of this part. For each application, the lender must prepare a credit evaluation that is consistent with Agency standards found in this part. The Agency reserves the right to review the lender's credit evaluation and request additional information. Lender approval does not constitute Agency approval.

      § 5001.202   Lender's credit evaluation.

#### § § 5001.202

      For each application, the lender must prepare a credit evaluation that is consistent with Agency standards found in this part. Lenders are required to only submit complete loan applications that have been approved by their institution after completion of their internal credit evaluation. The components of a lender's credit evaluation will include a written review and comment on the “Five Cs” of credit that are outlined in § 5001.202(b)(1) through (5). The Agency should be able to obtain sufficient details on the project, the borrower, and the borrower's ability to repay the loan from the lender's credit evaluation.

      (a)  The lender must conduct a credit evaluation using credit documentation procedures and underwriting processes that are consistent with generally accepted prudent lending practices for commercial, public and project financing, and also consistent with the lender's own policies, procedures, and lending practices. The underwriting process must include a review of each loan for which a loan guarantee is being sought under this part. Applications involving affiliated entities must include a global credit evaluation and if applicable a global historical and projected debt service coverage analysis. The lender should evaluate the relationships between all associated parties to determine potential risks which may affect our borrower and its ability to repay the loan. Entities which may have an impact on the borrower or significantly contribute to the repayment ability of the loan should provide financials for global analysis. Applications involving guarantor(s) must also include a global debt service coverage analysis of the guarantor(s) including the cash flow of the guarantor(s). In addition, the lender must review all applicable contracts, management agreements, and leases to determine they will not adversely affect either the borrower's repayment ability or the value of the collateral securing the guaranteed loan. The lender's evaluation must address any financial or other credit weaknesses of the borrower and project and discuss risk mitigation requirements imposed by the lender.

      (b)  In performing its credit evaluation, the lender must analyze all credit factors associated with each proposed guaranteed loan and apply its professional judgment to determine that the credit factors and guaranteed loan terms and conditions, considered in combination, ensure guaranteed loan repayment. Credit factors to be analyzed include, but are not necessarily limited to, those areas identified and defined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.

      (1)  Those qualities that generally impel the borrower to meet its obligations as demonstrated by its credit history, including project and borrower debt structure and debt repayment ability. When applicable, an evaluation may include the character of persons with management control or a 20 percent or more ownership interest in the borrower. When the borrower's credit history or character is negative, the lender will provide satisfactory explanations to indicate that any problems are unlikely to recur. The ownership or membership structure of the project and borrower (including membership, sponsors, other equity investors), and the historical performance and experience of ownership and management specific to the project and industry. The historical performance and experience of any entities providing management or administrative services pursuant to contract should also be evaluated. For CF projects the commitment of the rural community or rural area to be served by the project should be evaluated. Borrower's management, and its for-profit, non-profit or governing board, as applicable, will be evaluated to ensure key management personnel are adequately trained and experienced.

      (2)  A borrower's ability to produce sufficient cash to repay the guaranteed loan as agreed, including the feasibility and likelihood of the project and borrower to produce sufficient revenues to service the project's debt obligations over the life of the guaranteed loan and, when applicable, result in sufficient returns to investors to ensure successful repayment of the guaranteed loan. The lender shall address any economic safeguards of the project, including capital expenditure budgeting or reserve funds and other contingency reserve funds such as maintenance reserve funds or debt service reserve funds, intended to protect and safeguard the Agency and lender in the event of default. The lender must make all efforts to:

      (i) Ensure that the borrower has adequate working capital, operating capital and reserves for capital expenditures, debt service, and maintenance as applicable; and

      (ii) Structure or restructure debt so the borrower has adequate debt coverage, documenting as applicable the necessity of any debt refinancing. The evaluation will be supported by a cash flow analysis.

      (3)  The borrower must have the resources to adequately capitalize the project and demonstrate the ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash flow for its operations. The extent to which project costs are funded by the borrower in relation to project costs funded by the guaranteed loan or other Federal and non-Federal governmental assistance such as grants, tax credits, or other loans must be analyzed.

      (4)  This criterion refers to the security pledged for the guaranteed loan. The lender is responsible for obtaining and maintaining proper and adequate collateral for the guaranteed loan. All collateral must secure the entire guaranteed loan. The lender is prohibited from taking separate collateral for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the guaranteed loan or requiring compensating balances or certificates of deposit as a means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the unguaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan. Collateral can include, but is not limited to: General obligation bonds; revenue bonds; pledges of taxes or assessments; assignments of facility revenue and byproduct revenue, as well as other assets such as land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, buildings, machinery, equipment, inventory; accounts receivable, other accounts, contracts, cash, assignments of leases and leasehold interests. Intangible assets may serve as collateral, provided they do not serve as primary collateral. For purposes of determining compliance with this requirement, leasehold improvements such as buildings and other structures on leased property are considered tangible assets and can serve as primary collateral. It is the lender's responsibility to obtain, document, file, record and take all actions necessary to properly perfect and maintain adequate collateral to protect the interests of the lender and the Agency.

      (i) The lender must determine the market value of collateral as established by an appraisal in accordance with § 5001.203.

      (ii) The lender should discount collateral consistent with sound loan-to-discounted value practices which must be adequate to secure the guaranteed loan in accordance with this section. To assess collateral adequacy and appropriate levels of discounting, the lender should give consideration to the type, quality, location, marketability, and alternative uses of the collateral and the basis for the valuation of the collateral,  collateral valued on a cost or replacement valuation or market or comparable sales valuation may require variance of discount factors. The lender must provide satisfactory justification of the discounts being used.

      (5)  This paragraph (b)(5) refers to the general business environment, including the regulatory environment affecting the business or industry, and status of the borrower's industry. Consideration will be given to items listed in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (ix) of this section and when applicable the lender should submit supporting documentation ( feasibility study, market study, preliminary architectural or engineering reports, etc.) in accordance with  through

      (i) Availability and depth of resource/feedstock market, strength and duration of purchase agreements and availability of substitutes;

      (ii) Analysis of current and future market potential and off-take agreements, competition, type of project (service, product, or commodity based);

      (iii) Energy infrastructure, availability and dependability, transportation and other infrastructure, and environmental considerations;

      (iv) Technical feasibility including demonstrated performance of the technology and integrated processing equipment and systems, developer system performance guarantees, or technology insurance;

      (v) Complexity of construction and completion, terms of construction contracts, experience and financial strength of the construction contractor or engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor;

      (vi) Contracts and intellectual property rights, licenses, permits, and state and local regulations;

      (vii) Creditworthiness of any counterparties, as applicable;

      (viii) Industry-related public policy issues; and

      (ix) Other criteria that the lender or Agency deems relevant to the project.

      (6)  The credit evaluation must be sufficiently detailed to describe the proposed loan, business and project scenario and document that the proposed loan is sound. The credit evaluation must include:

      (i) A written evaluation of each credit factor listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section and any additional factors as appropriate; and

      (ii) A written evaluation of the feasibility study, business plan, technical report, and engineering and architectural reports, as applicable; and

      (iii) Spreadsheets and analysis of the financial statements provided in accordance with § 5001.303, with appropriate ratios and comparisons with industry standards (such as Dun & Bradstreet or the Risk Management Association). The spreadsheets should enable a reviewer to easily scan the data, spot trends, and make comparisons. Steps taken or proposed to address any financial or industry weakness must be reasonable and adequately addressed.

      (iv) Financial projections deviating from historical financial performance must be substantiated and documented. The borrower's projections should be consistent with their past performance. Increases to revenues, profit margins or profitability should be reasonable and substantiated in the analysis.

      (v) Projected operational cash flow analysis on a quarterly basis for borrowers with seasonal cyclical cash flow.

      (vi) Operational cash flow analysis on a quarterly basis from the current financial statements through start-up or occupancy for projects involving construction when lenders are requesting the loan note guarantee prior to completion of construction The lender and borrower are required to provide a construction schedule with their application for a loan guarantee prior to construction completion. The projected cash flow needs should mirror the quarterly construction costs as the project is being completed. The cash flow analysis must indicate whether this cash flow is being provided by the guaranteed loan, borrower equity, or other sources.

      § 5001.203   Appraisals.

#### § § 5001.203

      Appraisals of collateral are required as set forth in this section. The lender is responsible for ensuring that appraisal values adequately reflect the actual value of the collateral based on an arm's length transaction. Completed appraisals should be submitted when the application is filed. If the appraisal has not been completed when the application is filed, the lender must submit an estimated appraised value. Prior to the issuance of the loan note guarantee, the estimated value must be supported with an appraisal acceptable to the approval official. If an appraisal is received containing any value attributed to business valuation or as a going concern, the business valuation or going concern value must be deducted from the reconciled market value prior to discounting. The Agency expects that, for appraisals of existing facilities, the appraiser will physically visit the property unless prior permission from the Agency is obtained. Appraisals are not typically required when security consists of either a revenue or general obligation bond or liens on real estate for WWD projects which rely on revenues of the facilities for loan repayment.

      (a)  A bill of sale may be submitted to support the value of newly-acquired chattel.

      (b)  The lender must obtain appraisal(s) for existing chattel collateral when its value exceeds $250,000 and will be used to meet loan to value requirements.

      (c)  The lender must obtain appraisals for real estate collateral when the value of the collateral exceeds $250,000 or the current limitation established under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) Public Law 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989). Real estate and chattels with a value below these thresholds must be evaluated in accordance with the lender's primary regulator's policies relating to appraisals and evaluations or, if the lender is not regulated, in accordance with normal banking practices and generally accepted methods of determining value. For construction projects, the lender must obtain the “As is” market value and the “prospective” market value as of the date of construction completion to determine the value of the real estate property.

      (d)  (1) Each real estate appraisal must be conducted by an independent qualified appraiser in accordance with the USPAP or similar Agency approved standard. The appraiser must have the specific qualification, experience, and competency to appraise the type of facility being financed. All real estate appraisals must meet the requirements contained in the FIRREA, and the appropriate guidelines contained in Standards 1 and 2 of the USPAP or similar Agency approved standard, and, unless approved by the Agency approval official, be performed by a State Certified General Appraiser licensed in the State in which the real estate is located.

      (2) Chattel appraisals must be conducted by an independent qualified appraiser and must be based on industry recognized standards and reflect the age, condition, and remaining useful life of the equipment.

      (e)  Notwithstanding any exemption that may exist for transactions guaranteed by a Federal Government agency, all appraisals obtained by the lender under this part must conform to the interagency appraisal and evaluations guidelines established by the lender's primary Federal or State regulator, if applicable.

      (f)  When the Agency will take a lien on real property, the real estate appraisals must include consideration of the potential effects from a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products or other environmental hazards on the market value of the collateral, as determined in accordance with the appropriate ASTM International Real Estate Assessment and Management environmental standards. Potential contamination that has been observed on the property or identified through research or interviews with individuals knowledgeable about the property should be immediately reported to the Agency.

      (g)  The lender must submit its complete technical review of the appraisal in an appraisal review report prepared in compliance with USPAP Standards 3 and 4 to the Agency before guaranteed loan closing.

      (1) Appraisals must not be more than one year old. However, the Agency may request a more recent appraisal in order to reflect more current market conditions.

      (2) The lender must provide documentation that, in addition to the other requirements of this section pertaining to appraisers, the appraiser has the necessary experience and competency to appraise collateral.

      (h)  Unless otherwise stated in this part, appraisal fees or any other associated costs will not be paid by the Agency. Appraisal fees are eligible loan purposes. The Agency does not pay for appraisals required at the time of loan application. Appraisals for servicing actions are handled in accordance with section 5001 subpart F.

      § 5001.204   Personal, partnership, and corporate guarantees.

#### § § 5001.204

      The provisions of this section do not apply to passive investors.

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, Agency-approved, unsecured personal, partnership, and corporate guarantees for the full term of the guaranteed loan and at least equal to the guarantor's percent interest or membership in the borrower times the guaranteed loan amount are required from any person or entity owning a 20-percent or greater interest or membership in the borrower. In the event a portion of the borrower's ownership interest stock is sold or transferred, the Agency reserves the right to require personal or corporate guarantees from the new owners of a 20-percent or more interest in the borrower.

      (b) When warranted by an Agency assessment of potential financial risk, the Agency may require the following:

      (1) Guarantees to be secured;

      (2) Guarantees from any person or entity owning less than a 20-percent interest or membership in the borrower; and

      (3) Guarantees from persons whose ownership interest in the borrower is held indirectly through intermediate or affiliated entities.

      (c) Exceptions to the requirement for personal, partnership or corporate guarantees may be requested by the lender. The lender must document, to the Agency's satisfaction, that collateral, equity, cash flow, and profitability indicate an above-average ability of the borrower to repay the loan. The Agency will evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis.

      (d) Each guarantor must execute an Agency-approved guarantee form in addition to any guarantee form required by the lender.

      (e) Any amounts paid by the Agency pursuant to a claim by a guaranteed program lender will constitute a Federal debt owed to the Agency by a guarantor of the loan, to the extent of the amount of the guarantor's guarantee.

      § 5001.205   General project monitoring requirements.

#### § § 5001.205

      In complying with the requirements of this section, the lender may rely on written materials and other reports provided by an independent engineer and other qualified consultants.

      (a)  The lender must ensure that all facilities constructed with guaranteed loan funds are:

      (1) Designed using accepted architectural, engineering, and design practices, taking into consideration any Agency comments when the facility is being designed;

      (2) Designed in conformance to applicable Federal, Tribal, State, and local codes and requirements;

      (3) Constructed to support operations at the level and quality contemplated by the borrower using accepted architectural and engineering practices; and

      (4) Compliant with applicable domestic procurement preference requirements including section 70914 of the Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA) within the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58).

      (b)  The lender is responsible for ensuring that the borrower has:

      (1) Obtained valid, continuous, and adequate rights-of-way and easements, in compliance with Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) if applicable, needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a project; and

      (2) Obtained and recorded such releases, consents, or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the project and to provide the required security.

      (c)  It is the lender's responsibility to ensure the borrower obtains all permits, agreements, and licenses that are applicable to the project.

      (d)  It is the lender's responsibility to ensure the borrower obtains and maintains borrower and project insurance in substance and amount similar to that ordinarily required by lenders in the industry.

      (e)  The lender, or its designated agent, will monitor the progress of construction of the project and undertake the reviews and inspections necessary to ensure that construction conforms to applicable Federal, Tribal, State, and local code requirements and that construction proceeds in accordance with the plans, specifications, and contract documents.

      (1)  The lender must notify the Agency of any scheduled field inspections during construction. The Agency may attend any field inspections the lender may conduct. Any Agency inspection, including those with the lender, are for the benefit of the Agency only (and not for the benefit of other parties in interest) and do not relieve any parties of interest of their responsibilities to conduct necessary inspections. On a case-by-case basis in the event that the Agency determines that there is additional risk to the government, the Agency may require the use of a qualified, independent inspector to inspect construction to ensure the project is being adequately built to meet the borrower's requirements of the borrower's approved project and comply with all applicable codes and legal requirements.

      (2)  Except for projects utilizing non-proven technologies, the lender may request that the loan note guarantee be issued prior to completion of a project's construction. The lender's request will be considered by the Agency, who may require credit risk mitigation. An additional fee for issuance of the loan note guarantee prior to completion of the project's construction will be assessed in accordance with § 5001.454(c) in subpart E. The lender must verify and include evidence of the following in its request:

      (i) The promissory note specifying the full term of the note and containing the terms and conditions of each draw period;

      (ii) The borrower and lender have entered into a contract with an independent disbursement and monitoring firm with a construction monitoring plan acceptable to and approved by the Agency or, the lender documents that they have the capacity and experience to disburse funds and provides a monitoring plan acceptable to the Agency;

      (iii) The borrower and lender have agreed to a detailed timetable for the project with a corresponding budget of costs setting forth the parties responsible for payment. The timetable and budget will be confirmed as adequate for the planned development by a qualified independent consultant ( the project architect or engineer) with demonstrated experience relating to the project's industry. The lender must provide evidence that there is sufficient cash flow to complete the project construction, including contingencies for cost overruns, plus working capital during the business start-up period;

      (iv) The borrower has entered into a firm, fixed-price construction contract with an independent general contractor with costs outlined in detail and terms specifying change order approvals, the agreed retainage percentage, and the disbursement schedule. In all cases, borrower equity must be injected prior to any guaranteed loan funds;

      (v) Evidence the lender has properly vetted the financial feasibility and past performance of the contractor to show they are able to complete the project or that the lender has mitigated risk in the event the project is never completed, such as requiring a 100-percent performance/payment bond on the borrower's contractor to be maintained until the contractor is released from its obligation. The bonding agent must be listed on Treasury Circular 570;

      (vi) Evidence, which the Agency at its sole discretion determines is satisfactory, that the lender has completed the due diligence necessary to confirm that the contractor is able to complete the project based on information including but not limited to the financial statements and past performance of the contractor;

      (vii) When applicable, the borrower has entered into a contract with an independent technology development firm guaranteeing completion of the project with the necessary technology to successfully run the project and system performance for projects that utilize integrated processing equipment and systems, such as biorefineries, RESs, and chemical manufacturing plants. The credit underwriting of the independent technology development firm must be satisfactory to and approved by the Agency. This is not limited only to renewable energy projects, but may include energy efficiency, renewable chemical, and biobased manufacturing projects. The intent of the provision is to ensure that all technology proposed for the project can be successfully integrated together to ensure successful installation and performance of the system. The respective technology providers usually guarantee their specific technology with quality parameters of input such that the end-product is what is proposed in both quality and yield. An engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) provider is responsible for the construction and assembly of the plant or facility. They adopt the quality limits and guarantee that the integrated facility that is built will perform according to specifications such that the input and operational bounds are met. The provision is likely applicable to the following types of projects:

      (A)  An anaerobic digester project which uses a biological process that requires specific conditions and environment to be able to produce the product of biogas that can be refined to renewable natural gas (RNG). In some simpler cases the gas will be used for heat or electricity, but in other more involved cases, it will be cleaned and refined to make RNG that is marketable, and quality assessed to enter an interconnect pipeline. These types of projects should be approved and verified by an independent technology firm, for integrated performance integrity and operability as well as yield integrity.

      (B)  Like anaerobic digesters projects, a landfill biogas project will have multiple steps and processes such as collection, clean-up, flaring and refinement to a fuel or the gas can be used to produce electricity. These types of projects should be approved and verified by an independent technology firm for integrated performance integrity and operability, as well as yield integrity.

      (C)  A biofuel, ethanol, biomass, or biodiesel system will have multiple steps in which it must operate in line with the design proposed that has been from demonstration campaigns. It is paramount that an independent technology firm verify and guarantee the operation and performance of these integrated systems as they will have multiple processes which need to work in concert for the project to be successful. These types of projects should be approved and verified by an independent technology firm for integrated performance integrity and yield.

      (D)  Solar thermal systems must have multiple processes in order to provide the end product of power, hot water, or heat. Due to their potential complexity, these systems should be approved and verified by an independent technology firm for performance integrity and operability.

      (E)  These types of projects should be approved and verified by an independent technology firm for integrated performance integrity.

      (F)  Depending on system complexity and if it has multiple processes, the project should be fortified with a guarantee that the system will operate definitively.

      (G)  A project utilizing a series of chemical processes and reactions to produce a polymer that can be sold to make biodegradable plastics. An example of a BBP project utilizing gasification technology to produce a biochar or soil amendment as an end-user product.

      (viii) Evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agency, that there is sufficient contingency funding in place to handle unforeseen cost overruns without seeking additional guaranteed assistance.

      (f)  Regardless of when the loan note guarantee is issued, all lenders must report any problems in project development to the Agency within 15 calendar days of identifying the problem. If the loan note guarantee has been issued prior to construction or completion of the project, the lender must provide monthly construction reports that contain:

      (1) Certifications for each draw request as follows:

      (i) Certification by the independent engineer or qualified consultant to the lender that the work referred to in the draw has been successfully completed; and;

      (ii) Certification by the borrower and independent engineer or qualified consultant that the guaranteed loan funds of the prior draw have been applied to eligible project costs in accordance with the draw request and that the contractors have delivered mechanics lien waivers in connection with such draw;

      (2) List of invoices;

      (3) Details regarding the borrower's equity, other funds, and guaranteed loan funds disbursed to date;

      (4) Status of construction; and

      (5) Inspection reports; and

      (6) Concerns, potential problems, cost overruns, etc.

      (g)  The lender must ensure that:

      (1) All borrower funds are utilized prior to guaranteed loan funds;

      (2) Guaranteed loan funds are only used for eligible project costs in accordance with the purposes approved by the Agency in the conditional commitment and in accordance with the plans, specifications, and contract documents; and

      (3) The project will be completed within the approved budget.

      (h)  Once construction of the project is completed, the lender must obtain and have on file all mechanics lien waivers or releases from all contractors and materialmen. The lender will provide to the Agency:

      (1) A copy of the notice of completion or similar document issued by the relevant jurisdiction;

      (2) Certification that all funds were used for authorized purposes; and

      (3) A written certification that the project will be used for its intended purpose and will meet the borrower's needs and guaranteed loan purposes in accordance with the application approved by the Agency.

      (4) RES or EEI projects and projects that utilize integrated processing systems and equipment, such as biorefineries, renewable energy systems, and chemical manufacturing facilities, unless utilizing the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, must be constructed, installed, and operated as described in the technical report or on the vendor certification prior to disbursement of guaranteed loan funds. For RES, the system must be operating at the steady state operating level described in the technical report or on the vendor certification for a period of not less than 30 calendar days, unless this requirement is modified by the Agency, prior to disbursement of funds.

      § 5001.304   Specific application requirements for CF projects.

#### § § 5001.304

      In addition to the requirements specified in § 5001.303 as applicable, a lender seeking a loan guarantee for a CF project must submit a financial feasibility report prepared by a qualified firm or individual acceptable to the Agency. All projects financed under this section must meet the financial feasibility requirements of this section and must be based on projected taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for project operation and maintenance, debt payments, and compliance with lender reserve requirements, when applicable. Other sources of revenue or existence of payment guarantors are particularly important in considering the feasibility of eligible recreation projects. The financial feasibility report must take into consideration any interest rate adjustment that may be instituted under the terms of the promissory note. Financial projections for projects that are assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or similar types of eligible residential facilities must be based on no more than 90 percent occupancy. Utility projects dependent on user fees for debt repayment shall base their income and expense forecast on user estimates supported by either a State statute or local ordinance requiring mandatory hookup or signed and enforceable user agreements. If the primary use of the essential community facility is by a business and the success or failure of the facility is dependent on that business, then the economic viability of that business must also be assessed. For projects that include the purchase and installation of RES that meet the eligibility requirements of § 5001.103(a)(8), a technical report on the RES as outlined in § 5001.307(e)(1) and (2), as applicable, will be included with the applicable financial feasibility report. The type of financial feasibility report required will depend upon the size of the guaranteed loan, the collateral securing the guaranteed loan, and the financial history of the borrower. The two types of financial feasibility report and when they are required are described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (a)  The financial feasibility analysis will be prepared by a qualified firm or individual who may be the lender. Financial feasibility analysis requirements are outlined in appendix B to subpart D of this part. The lender's credit evaluation may serve as the financial feasibility analysis provided it includes the items outlined in appendix B to subpart D of this part. A financial feasibility analysis will be required if any of the following circumstances exist:

      (1) Guaranteed loans of $25 million or less to existing community facilities;

      (2) Guaranteed loans secured by a general obligation bond, or other tax supported income sufficient to pay the debt service for the life of the loan; or

      (3) Borrowers with audited financial statements, if the last three years indicate the ability to pay all existing and new debt service.

      (4) The Agency may require a feasibility study when the lender's analysis, borrower's business plan, or project information is not sufficient to determine the technical feasibility, market feasibility, or economic viability of the project.

      (i) For guaranteed loans greater than $1,000,000.00 to a new entity or an entity conducting a new activity, a feasibility study prepared by an independent qualified consultant acceptable to the Agency is required. The scope of the feasibility study will be determined by the Agency and is dependent on the complexity of the project and the borrower.

      (ii) For loans of $1,000,000.00 or less to new and existing entities, the Agency may require a feasibility study when the lender's analysis or other borrower information is not sufficient to determine the technical feasibility or economic viability of the project, or if the project will significantly affect the operations of a borrower who is an existing entity and its historic cash flow.

      (b)  The report must be prepared in accordance with the standards of attestation of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the preparer must have the requisite professional liability insurance in place. A financial feasibility study with examination opinion will be required for all guaranteed loans that do not meet the requirements for a financial feasibility analysis outlined in paragraph (a) of this section. The financial feasibility study with examination opinion will typically include the items outlined in appendix B to subpart D of this part.

      (a)  (1) Engineering documentation must meet the level of detail the lender would typically require for a standard commercial loan, and include, at a minimum, a description of the proposed project, a cost estimate, the number of residential and non-residential connections, and the population served. The lender may request assistance to clarify the Agency's requirements and regulations; however, the Agency does not provide technical oversight or recommendations as to the technical feasibility of the project.

      (2) The lender must ensure that the project is designed utilizing accepted architectural and engineering practices and conforms to applicable Federal requirements ( the seismic requirements of Executive Order 12699 (55 FR 835, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 269), the debarment requirements of 2 CFR part 180 as supplemented by 2 CFR part 417, American Iron and Steel (Section 746 of Title VII of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017), and the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act (18 U.S.C. 874)); State, local and Tribal codes and requirements; and facility plans or plans and specifications reviewed and approved by the applicable State, local and/or Tribal regulatory agency. The lender must also ensure that the planned project will be completed within the available funds and once completed, will be suitable for the borrower's needs. Upon completion of the project, the lender must certify that all applicable Federal requirements were met.

      (b)  All projects financed under this part must be based on projected taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for project operation and maintenance, any reserves required by the lender, and debt payment. The lender's financial credit analysis must take into consideration any interest rate adjustment that may be instituted under the terms of the loan note guarantee.

      (c)  In addition to the requirements of § 5001.202, if the majority user of the system is a business and the financial success of the system is dependent on that business, then the economic viability of that business must be assessed.

      (d)  (1)  Guaranteed loans must comply with AIS requirements. Lenders and borrowers are responsible for meeting the AIS requirements of Section 746 of Title VII of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 and the continuing resolutions adopted thereafter.

      (2)  BABAA was enacted as part of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58) on November 15, 2021 and became effective on May 14, 2022. Under Section 70914(a) of BABAA, “none of the funds made available for a Federal financial assistance program for infrastructure may be obligated for a project unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States.” Additional information may be found on the Agency's Build America, Buy America website at

      (3)  Owners are ultimately responsible for compliance with the domestic procurement preference requirements and should consult with the Agency early in project development. Compliance must be certified to prior to the issuance of the loan note guarantee. The lender must include any domestic preference language, provided by the Agency, in the loan agreement and other appropriate loan documents.

      (2) A pro forma balance sheet projected for loan closing.

      (3) The Agency may require a feasibility study when the lender's analysis, borrower's business plan, or project information is not sufficient to determine the technical feasibility, market feasibility, or economic viability of the project.

      (i) For guaranteed loans greater than $1,000,000.00 to a new business, a feasibility study prepared by an independent qualified consultant acceptable to the Agency is required. The scope of the feasibility study will be determined by the Agency and is dependent on the complexity of the project and the borrower.

      (ii) For loans of $1,000,000.00 or less to new and existing businesses, the Agency may require a feasibility study when the lender's analysis or other borrower information is not sufficient to determine the technical feasibility or economic viability of the project, or if the project will significantly affect the operations of a borrower who is an existing business and its historic cash flow.

      (iii) A technical report is required for RES identified in § 5001.307(e) and for projects utilizing other integrated processing equipment and systems. The contents of the technical report must be consistent with the requirements of § 5001.307(e)(1) and must provide sufficient detail to enable the Agency to determine technical merit.

#### § §§ 5001.308-5001.314

      § 5001.315   Application evaluation and award provisions.

#### § § 5001.315

      (a)  The Agency will evaluate all applications according to the provisions of this part and may require the lender to obtain additional assistance in those areas where the lender does not have the necessary expertise to originate or service the guaranteed loan. For the purposes of this paragraph (a), “those areas” mean:

      (1) The type and complexity of the financing ( asset-based financing, cash flow financing, and bond financing); and

      (2) Loans to borrowers engaged in industries where the lender has little or no origination and/or servicing experience.

      (b)  The Agency will review each complete application to make a formal determination as to: the eligibility of the borrower, lender, project, and guaranteed loan purpose and proposed use of funds; if there is a reasonable assurance of repayment ability; if sufficient collateral and equity exists; if the proposed guaranteed loan complies with all applicable statutes and regulations; and if the environmental review is complete. The Agency will only guarantee loans that are sound and that have a reasonable assurance of repayment.

      (1) If the Agency's evaluation and determination in accordance with this paragraph (b) is favorable, the Agency will proceed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) If the Agency's evaluation and determination in accordance with this paragraph (b) is unfavorable, the Agency will notify the lender, in writing, as applicable, identifying the reason(s) for determining ineligibility and any applicable appeal or review rights. No further processing of the application will occur.

      (c)  The Agency will score each eligible application based on the point system for the respective program identified in §§ 5001.316 through 5001.319.

      (1) Lenders must provide necessary information related to determining the priority score, if requested by the Agency. To the extent possible, lenders should consider the established priorities of the Agency when submitting projects for a loan guarantee. Higher scoring applications will receive first consideration for funding.

      (2) The Agency may establish a minimum priority score for each guarantee program. The Agency will, if established, publish the minimum score in a document in the  Applications that do not meet the applicable minimum score will compete with all other guaranteed loan applications for each specific program in a competition on the first business day of September of the Federal fiscal year in which the application is ready for funding.

      (d)  Each program identified in § 5001.1 will consider applications for funding in the order they are received by the Agency. If the Agency approves the application and guaranteed funds are available, the Agency will issue a conditional commitment to the lender in accordance with § 5001.451 of subpart E. In the event total loan requests exceed the amount of funding available the applications will be ranked for priority by each program. As applications are funded, the remaining guaranteed loan funding authority may be insufficient to fund the next highest scoring application or applications (where two or more applications receive the same priority score). The Agency will use the procedures described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section as often as necessary to consider all applications as appropriate.

      (1) If the remaining funds are insufficient to fund the next highest scoring application completely, the Agency will notify the lender and offer the lender the opportunity to accept the remaining funds. If the lender does not accept the offer, the Agency will process the next highest scoring application.

      (2) If the remaining funds are insufficient to fund each application that receives the same priority score, the Agency will notify each lender and offer the lenders the opportunity to accept a prorated share of the remaining funds.

      (3) Any lender offered less than the full amount requested under either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section can either accept the funds available or request to compete in the next funding cycle. There is no assurance that the application(s) will be funded in a subsequent funding cycle.

      (4) If a lender agrees to the lower loan guarantee amount offered by the Agency under either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the lender must certify that the purpose(s) of the project can still be met at the lower funding level and must provide documentation that the borrower has obtained the remaining funds needed to complete the project as originally proposed.

      (e)  The Agency will withdraw from consideration ranked applications that have not received funding as follows:

      (1) If an unfunded application has a priority score equal to or greater than any applicable minimum score, the Agency will retain the application for consideration in subsequent funding cycles. If the unfunded application is not selected for funding after 12 months, including the first month in which the application was considered, the Agency will withdraw the application from further funding consideration.

      (2) If an unfunded application has a priority score less than any applicable minimum score and remains unfunded after the competition held on the first business day of September of the fiscal year in which the application is ready for funding, the Agency will notify the applicant in writing and withdraw the application from further funding consideration.

      (f)  The borrower assumes all risks if the borrower purchases real property or equipment or starts construction of the project to be financed by a guaranteed loan after the complete application has been received by the Agency, but prior to the Agency's issuance of the conditional commitment and the lender and borrower's acceptance of the conditional commitment.

      (g)  During the period between the submission of an application and prior to issuance of the conditional commitment, the lender must notify the Agency, in writing, if the project is no longer viable or the borrower no longer is requesting financial assistance for the project. When the lender notifies the Agency, the Agency will rescind the selection and withdraw the application, as applicable.

      § 5001.319   REAP project priority point system.

#### § § 5001.319

      This section applies to REAP projects seeking a loan guarantee. On a periodic basis, and subject to the availability of funds, the Agency will compete each complete and eligible RES, EEI, and EEE application that is ready to be funded and whose priority score, as determined in this section, meets, or exceeds the minimum priority score. Applications that do not meet the applicable minimum score will be considered as provided in § 5001.315(c)(2). A maximum score of 90 points is possible.

      (a)  The Agency will award up to 5 points under this criterion based on documentation or the applicant's indication in the application that the project will have a positive effect on resource conservation, public health, and the environment. If the project will have a positive impact on:

      (1) All three impact areas, 5 points will be awarded;

      (2) Any two of the three impact areas, 3 points will be awarded; or

      (3) Any one of the three impact areas, 1 point will be awarded.

      (b)  The Agency will award up to 25 points under this criterion. Each application is eligible for points under both paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

      (1)  The Agency will award up to 10 points under this sub-criterion. Points will be awarded for either the amount of renewable energy generation per dollar of loan amount requested, which includes those projects that are replacing energy usage with a renewable source; or the actual annual average energy savings over the most recent 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 consecutive months of operation per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested; or the percent efficiency of the EEE project. The Agency will not award points for more than one category.

      (i)  The quantity of energy generated or replaced per guaranteed loan dollar requested will be determined by dividing the projected total annual energy generated or replaced by the RES or RES retrofit (minus energy for residential use), which will be converted to BTUs, by the guaranteed loan dollars requested. Applications for retrofitting of a RES that are not projecting to increase the amount of renewable energy that the RES is generating, while still eligible for REAP, will not be awarded points under this criteria. Off-the-grid projects and direct-use projects which are not replacements, will be awarded points based on proposed energy generation. Points will be awarded under this sub-criterion based on the annual amount of energy generated or replaced (minus energy for residential use) per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested for the RES project. The Agency will award up to 10 points as determined under  and  of this section below. If the annual amount of energy generated per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested calculated under  of this section is:

      (A) 50,000 BTUs or higher average annual energy generated or replaced per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested or higher, 10 points will be awarded; or

      (B) Less than 50,000 BTUs annual energy generated or replaced per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested, points will be awarded according to the result of taking the energy generated or replaced per guaranteed loan dollar requested ÷ 50,000 × 10 points. The points awarded are rounded to the nearest hundredth of a point.

      (ii)  The Agency will award up to 10 points under this sub-criterion based on the average annual energy saved per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested for the EEI project. The Agency will award up to 10 points as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.

      (A) 50,000 BTUs or higher average annual energy saved per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested, 10 points will be awarded; or

      (B) Less than 50,000 BTUs average annual energy saved per dollar of guaranteed loan amount requested, points will be awarded according to the result of taking the energy generated per loan dollar requested ÷ 50,000 × 10 points. The points awarded are rounded to the nearest hundredth of a point.

      (iii)  If the increased energy efficiency of the proposed equipment and systems is—

      (A) 75 percent or greater, award 10 points;

      (B) Less than 75 percent but equal to or greater than 50 percent, award 5 points;

      (C) Less than 50 percent but equal to or greater than 25 percent, award 2.5 points; or

      (D) Less than 25 percent, award 0 points.

      (2)  The Agency will award up to 15 points under this sub-criterion. Points will be awarded based on whether the project is for energy replacement, energy generation, or energy savings, or percentage of energy efficiency; points will not be awarded for more than one category.

      (i)  The Agency will award points under this sub-criterion for an RES project based on the amount of energy replaced by the project compared to the amount of energy used by the applicable process(es) over a 12-month period. If the estimated energy produced is more than 150 percent of the energy used by the applicable process(es), the project will be scored as an energy generation project under  of this section. When calculating the percentage of energy being replaced and whether it is categorized as a replacement or generation, the entire amount of energy produced by the new system will be used in the calculation, regardless of whether the project is being prorated because it shares a meter with a residence or if it has ineligible project costs.

      (A)  For a RES project to qualify as energy replacement, the borrower must provide documentation in its application on prior energy use incurred by the borrower. Documentation must be shown that the borrower entity incurred the cost of the historical energy to be replaced, in order for the project to qualify as energy replacement. Replacement of existing direct use renewable energy can be considered in the replacement calculation as long as the borrower entity owns the existing RES system. For a project involving a recent acquisition, historical energy costs of the previous owner can be used to document prior energy use. Applicant entities cannot utilize historical energy costs of affiliate businesses to document prior energy use. Proposed energy use, such as that attributed to an expansion, is not considered in the replacement calculation. For a RES project involving new construction and being installed to serve the new facility, the project can be classified as energy replacement only if the borrower can document prior energy use from a facility that is within plus or minus 10 percent of the size of the facility it is replacing. The estimated quantities of energy must be converted to either BTUs, watts, or similar energy equivalents to facilitate scoring.

      (B)  Energy replacement is determined by dividing the quantity of renewable energy that the RES project is estimated would have been generated if it were in place over the most recent 12-month period by the quantity of energy actually consumed over the same period by the applicable energy process(es) that is(are) consuming energy.

      (C)  Using the results from paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, if the percentage of energy replacement is—

      () Greater than 50 percent, _1_5 points will be awarded;

      () Greater than _2_5 percent, but equal to or less than 50 percent, 10 points will be awarded; or

      () Equal to or less than 25 percent, 5 points will be awarded.

      (ii)  If the RES project is intended for production of energy or is a proposed retrofitting of an existing RES which increases the amount of energy generated, the Agency will award 10 points. Applications for retrofitting of an RES that are not projecting to increase the amount of renewable energy that the RES is generating, while still eligible for REAP, will not be awarded points under this criteria. If the borrower cannot document prior energy use, the project will be scored as an energy generation project, regardless of whether or not there is an agreement in place to sell the power.

      (iii)  The Agency will award up to 15 points under this sub-criterion for an EEI project based on the percentage of estimated energy saved by the installation of the project as determined by the projections in the applicable vendor certification, energy assessment or energy audit. If the estimated energy expected to be saved over the same period used in the energy assessment or energy audit, as applicable, will be—

      (A) 50 percent or greater, 15 points will be awarded;

      (B) 35 percent up to, but not including 50 percent, 10 points will be awarded;

      (C) 20 percent up to, but not including 35 percent, 5 points will be awarded; or

      (D) Less than 20 percent, no points will be awarded.

      (iv)  If the percentage of energy efficiency is—

      (A) Greater than 50 percent, 15 points will be awarded;

      (B) Greater than 25 percent, but equal to or less than 50 percent, 10 points will be awarded; or

      (C) Equal to or less than 25 percent, 5 points will be awarded.

      (c)  The Agency will award up to 15 points under this criterion based on the percentage of acceptable written commitment a borrower has from its other funding sources that are documented with a complete application.

      (1)  The percentage of written commitment is calculated as follows: Percentage of written commitment = total amount of funds for which written commitments have been submitted with the application ÷ Total amount of matching funds and other funds required.

      (2)  Using the result from paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Agency will award points as shown in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

      (i) If the percentage of written commitments is 100 percent of the matching funds, 15 points will be awarded.

      (ii) If the percentage of written commitments is less than 100 percent, but more than 50 percent, points will be awarded as follows: ((Percentage of written commitments − 50 percent) ÷ (50 percent)) × 15 points, where points awarded are rounded to the nearest hundredth of a point.

      (iii) If the percentage of written commitments is 50 percent or less, no points will be awarded.

      (d)  The Agency will award up to 15 points under this criterion based on whether the borrower has received and accepted a REAP grant award under 7 CFR part 4280 or a guaranteed loan commitment under either this part or 7 CFR part 4280. Received and accepted means REAP grant funds were disbursed and/or a REAP loan note guarantee was issued by the Agency. The determination is based on the fiscal year in which the obligation was made.

      (1) If the borrower has never received and accepted a grant award under 7 CFR part 4280 or a guaranteed loan commitment under either this part or 7 CFR part 4280, 15 points will be awarded.

      (2) If the borrower has not received and accepted a grant award under 7 CFR part 4280 or a guaranteed loan commitment under either this part or 7 CFR part 4280 within the previous two Federal fiscal years, 10 points will be awarded.

    Subpart E—Loan and Guarantee Provisions

      Loan Provisions

        § 5001.401   Interest rate provisions.

#### § § 5001.401

        Interest rates, interest rate caps, and incremental interest rate adjustment limitations on a guaranteed loan are negotiated between the lender and the borrower. The interest rate for a guaranteed loan can be either fixed or variable, or a combination thereof, as long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates cannot be more than those rates the lender customarily charges its borrowers for non-guaranteed loans in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business. The Agency encourages each lender to use the secondary market and pass interest-rate savings on to the borrower. If an interest rate swap is utilized, the guarantee will only cover principal and interest. The lender must provide the Agency with the overall effective interest rate charged to the borrower in the swap transaction. The Agency guarantee does not cover any fees related to the swap.

        (a)  guaranteed  It is permissible to have different interest rates on the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the _loan._

        (b)  A variable interest rate must be an interest rate that is tied to a published base rate, as published in a national or regional financial publication, and is agreed to by the Agency.

        (1) The variable interest base rate must be specified in the promissory note along with any interest factors ( National Prime plus 1.0 percent).

        (2) The lender may adjust the variable interest rate at different intervals during the term of the loan, but not more often than quarterly.

        (3) The lender must incorporate, within the variable rate promissory note, a provision for adjustment of payment installments to fully amortize the loan by its maturity date.

        (c)  When multi-rates are used, the lender must provide the Agency with the overall effective interest rate for the entire loan.

        (d)  Any change in the base rate or fixed interest rate between issuance of the conditional commitment and loan closing must be approved by the Agency. Approval of such a change must be shown as an amendment to the conditional commitment and must be reflected on the guaranteed loan closing report form.

        § 5001.402   Term length, loan schedule, and repayment.

#### § § 5001.402

        (a)  The lender, with Agency concurrence, will establish and justify the guaranteed loan term based on the use of guaranteed loan funds, the useful economic life of the assets being financed and those used as collateral, and the borrower's repayment ability. The maximum term allowable for final guaranteed loan maturity is limited to the justified useful life of the project or assets used as collateral but may not exceed 40 years or limitations in the applicable State statute, whichever is less.

        (b)  The lender must structure repayment in consideration of the borrower's cash flow and in accordance with the provisions of this section and the loan agreement. Scheduled guaranteed loan payments shall be made no less frequently than annually. In addition:

        (1) Both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan must be amortized over the same term.

        (2) Guaranteed loans must require a periodic payment schedule that will retire the debt over the term of the loan without a balloon payment. Balloon maturities are not allowed, unless required as a loan servicing action. Payments must be amortized to maximize successful loan repayment and may vary by type of business or cash flow.

        (3) If the promissory note provides for an interest-only period, interest must be paid at least annually starting on a date that is no more than one year from the date of the promissory note. Scheduling of the first payment of principal and interest will be subject to consideration of whether the facility is operational and generates adequate income. However, the scheduling of the first full principal and interest payment must commence not more than 3 years from the date of the promissory note and be paid at least annually thereafter.

        (4) There must be no “due-on-demand” clauses without cause. Regardless of any “due-on-demand” with cause provision in a lender's promissory note, the Agency must concur in any acceleration of the guaranteed loan unless the basis for acceleration is monetary default.

        § 5001.403   Lender fees.

#### § § 5001.403

        (a) The lender may charge the borrower reasonable, routine, and customary charges and fees for the guaranteed loan provided they are similar to those charges the lender assesses other borrowers for the same type of loan not subject to a loan guarantee. The lender must document such fees in the application. The lender may also charge routine and customary prepayment penalties and late payment fees for the guaranteed loan, which must be stated in the guaranteed loan documents.

        (b) Default charges, penalty interest, late payment fees, and additional interest expenses are not covered by the loan note guarantee and cannot be added to the principal or interest due under any loan note guarantee in the event of a loss claim as prescribed in § 5001.521 or a repurchase as prescribed in § 5001.511.

In addition to the borrower loan limit, there is a guarantor loan limit of $100 million.

        (d)  The amount of a guaranteed loan that will be made available to an eligible project and borrower under this part will be at least $5,000, not to exceed 75 percent of eligible project costs. Borrowers must demonstrate evidence of a financial contribution in the project of not less than 25 percent of total eligible project costs.

#### § § 5001.407

        The percent of loan guaranteed may vary from program to program. The maximum guarantee is 90 percent of eligible guaranteed loan loss The Agency will set annually a guarantee percentage by program that will apply to loans guaranteed within each program.

        (1)  The lender may obtain participation in the loan under its normal operating procedures; however, the lender must retain title to and possession of the promissory note(s) and retain the lender's interest in the collateral.

        (2)  Any assignment by the lender of the guaranteed portion of the loan must be accomplished in accordance with the conditions in the lender's agreement and the provisions of this section. The holders and the borrower have no rights or obligations to one another. The holders and the borrower have no rights or obligations to one another.

        (i) The lender must hold a minimum of 7.5 percent of the total loan amount.

        (ii) The lender must retain its security interest in the collateral and retain the servicing responsibilities for the guaranteed loan.

        (iii) The Agency can approve a reduction of the minimum retention requirement below the applicable percentage on a case-by-case basis when the lender establishes to the Agency's satisfaction that reduction of the minimum retention percentage is necessary to meet compliance with the lender's regulatory authority.

        (4)  The lender must not assign or participate any amount of the guaranteed or non-guaranteed portion of the loan to the borrower, borrower's officers, directors, stockholders, other owners, or to members of their immediate families, or to a parent company, an affiliate, or a subsidiary of the borrower.

        (5)  The lender must properly close their loan and fully disburse loan funds of a promissory note for the purposes intended prior to assignment of the guaranteed portion of the promissory note(s) on the secondary market. The lender can assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan only if the loan is not in default. Default includes a borrower default in payments or a lender default by unpaid periodic guarantee retention fees. A lender using the multi-note system may sell the guarantee on the secondary market for a specific note once that note is fully disbursed, even if other guaranteed notes for the project have not been fully disbursed.

        (b)  The assignment guarantee agreement must clearly state the guarantee portion of loan as a percentage and corresponding dollar amount of the guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan it represents and the lender's servicing fee.

The lender must complete and execute the assignment guarantee agreement and return it to the Agency for execution prior to holder execution.

        (2) The lender or holder may request a certificate of incumbency and signature from the Agency.

        (3) A holder, upon written notice to the lender and the Agency, may reassign the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan, in full, assigned under the assignment guarantee agreement. Holders can only reassign the complete block they have received and cannot subdivide or further split their interest in the guaranteed portion of a loan or retain an interest strip.

        (4) Upon notification and completion of the assignment through the use of the assignment guarantee agreement, the assignee succeeds to all rights and obligations of the holder thereunder. Subsequent assignments require notice to the lender and Agency using any format, including that used by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (formerly known as the Bond Market Association), together with the transfer of the original assignment guarantee agreement.

        (5) The Agency will not execute a new assignment guarantee agreement to affect a subsequent reassignment.

        (1) A guarantee and right to require purchase in accordance with § 5001.511 will be directly enforceable by a holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by the lender or any unenforceability of the loan guarantee by the lender, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became the holder or in which the holder participates or condones.

        (2) The lender must not represent a conditional commitment of guarantee as a loan guarantee.

        (3) The lender must reimburse the Agency for any payments the Agency makes to a holder on the lender's behalf under the loan note guarantee, given the lender would not be entitled to the payments had they retained the entire interest in the loan.

        (b)  A guaranteed loan under this part will be evidenced by a loan note guarantee issued by the Agency.

        (1) The entire loan must be secured by the same collateral with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion. A parity or junior lien position in the guaranteed loan collateral may be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the Agency during the loan approval process. Requirements for guaranteed loans to purchase cooperative stock are found in § 5001.140.

        (2) The lender must remain mortgagee and secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the guaranteed loan.

        (3) The lender will receive all payments of principal and interest on account of the entire guaranteed loan and must promptly remit to each holder and participant, if any, its pro rata share of any payment within 30 days of the lender's receipt thereof from the borrower. Holder or participant payments are determined according to their respective interest in the guaranteed loan, less only the lender's servicing fee.

        (4) Any claim against a loan note guarantee or assignment guarantee agreement that is attached to, or relating to, a promissory note that provides for payment of interest-on-interest, default charges, penalty interest, or late payment fees will be reduced to remove such interest, fees and charges.

        (5) The loan note guarantee is unenforceable by the lender to the extent that any loss is occasioned by:

        (i) The violation of usury laws;

        (ii) Use of guaranteed loan funds for unauthorized loan purposes in accordance with § 5001.122 or to the extent that those funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by the Agency in its conditional commitment or amendment thereof;

        (iii) Failure to obtain, perfect, document, and or maintain the required collateral or security position regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge thereof; and

        (iv) Negligent loan origination or negligent loan servicing as determined and documented by the Agency.

        (6) The Agency will guarantee payment as follows:

        (i) To any holder, 100 percent of any loss sustained by the holder on the guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan it owns and on interest due (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section) on such portion less any outstanding servicing fee.

        (ii) To the lender: Any loss sustained by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan, including principal and interest (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) evidenced by the promissory note(s) or assumption agreements entered into in connection with an Agency approved transfer and assumption, and secured advances for protection and preservation of collateral made with the Agency's authorization if applicable.

        (c)  If a loan has been guaranteed by the Agency prior to October 1, 2020, the Agency will guarantee the lender and any holders accrued interest in accordance with the applicable regulations in effect for the respective program at the time the loan was guaranteed. For all guaranteed loans closed on or after October 1, 2020, the Agency will guarantee accrued interest in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (2), as applicable, of this section.

        (1) If the lender owns all or a portion of the guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan or makes a protective advance, the Agency, in its sole discretion, may cover interest on the guaranteed portion for the 90 days from the most recent delinquency effective date. Per paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if applicable, the lender should issue an interest termination letter to any holder(s) and provide the Agency with a copy. The Agency will entertain the payment of interest up to 180 days past the most recent delinquency effective date only if:

        (i) The lender, and not the Agency, has repurchased all holder interests in the guaranteed loan in accordance with § 5001.511;

        (ii) The lender is actively engaged in a credit resolution with the borrower to bring the account current or fully liquidate the collateral under the terms of a liquidation plan approved by the Agency; and

        (iii) Concurrence for inclusion of the extended period of interest to the lender is received from the Agency. The lender must request an extension of accrued interest in writing and document their collection efforts and timeframe for full resolution, which must be within 180 days from the most recent delinquency. Approved collection efforts that will extend longer than 180 days from the most recent delinquency date will be limited to 90 days of accrued interest payment from the Agency.

        (2) If the guaranteed loan has one or more holders, the lender will issue an interest termination letter to each holder establishing the termination date for interest accrual and provide the Agency with a copy. The loan note guarantee will not cover interest to any holder accruing after 90 days from the date of the interest termination letter. The Agency at its sole discretion may notify each holder of the interest termination provisions if it is determined that lender correspondence to holders is inadequate.

      (a)  For RES projects, commencing the first full calendar year following the year in which project construction was completed and continuing for three full years, the borrower must provide an outcome project performance certification noting that either the system has or has not performed at the steady state operating level as described in the technical report filed with the REAP guaranteed loan application, and whether projected jobs created or saved have occurred. If it has not performed as intended, a report detailing the circumstances affecting performance must be provided to the Agency along with the actual energy production of the system (in BTUs, kilowatt-hours, or similar energy equivalents) and the actual number of jobs created or saved as a direct result of the RES project for which guaranteed loan funds were used.

      (b)  For EEI projects, commencing the first full calendar year following the year in which project construction was completed and continuing for two full years, the borrower must provide an outcome project performance certification noting that either the energy efficiency improvements have or have not been utilized at or above the projected operating levels as described in the technical report filed with the REAP guaranteed loan application, and whether projected jobs created or saved have occurred. If it has not performed as intended, a report detailing the circumstances affecting performance must be provided to the Agency along with the actual energy savings of the system and the actual number of jobs created or saved as a direct result of the EEI project for which guaranteed loan funds were used.

      § 5001.504   Financial reports.

#### § § 5001.504

      (a) The lender must obtain the borrower's and any guarantor's financial statements required by this part and the loan agreement. The Agency may require an annual audited financial statement based on a project's circumstances. States, local government, Indian tribes, institution of higher education, and nonprofit organization borrowers who meet the Federal awards expended threshold established in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, “Audit Requirements,” during their fiscal year must submit an audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      (b) The lender must submit financial statements obtained under this section to the Agency within 120 days of the end of the borrower's fiscal year. When the borrower's audit is conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, audits must be submitted no later than nine months after the end of the borrower's fiscal year or 30 days after the borrower's receipt of the auditor's report, whichever is earlier. If a lender makes reasonable documented attempts to obtain financial statements but is unable to obtain the borrower's (or guarantor's) cooperation, the failure to obtain financial statements does not impair the validity of the loan note guarantee.

      (c) Annual financial statements must be in accordance with accounting practices acceptable to the Agency as prescribed in § 5001.9 for all borrowers with a guaranteed loan balance in excess of $600,000. The lender may determine the type and frequency of financial statements for borrowers with a total guaranteed loan balance below $600,000 upon notification and justification to the Agency. This section does not supersede the borrower financial statement requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      (d) The lender must analyze the financial statements obtained under paragraph (a) of this section and provide the Agency with a financial analysis including a credit evaluation of trends, strength and weaknesses, ratio analysis, and conclusions, plus any extraordinary transactions; borrower violations of loan covenants and covenant waivers proposed by the lender, any routine servicing actions performed; and other indications of the financial condition of the borrower.

      (e) Following the Agency's review of the lender's financial analysis, the Agency will notify the lender in writing of any concerns. The lender must address each concern identified in the Agency's findings by the due date stated in the correspondence.

      (f) The lender should routinely confirm the outstanding principal balance of a guarantee held by a holder to avoid any discrepancy and delay in reconciliation in the event of a lender or Agency repurchase of the guaranteed loan from a holder in accordance with § 5001.511.

      § 5001.505   Collateral inspection and release.

#### § § 5001.505

      (a)  The lender must inspect the collateral as often as necessary to properly service the guaranteed loan.

      (b)  The lender must provide written justification for the release and obtain Agency approval before releasing any collateral. The lender is not required to provide justification for the release of collateral when the loan is not in default or liquidation and the collateral being released is a working asset, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and work-in-progress, that are routinely depleted or sold and proceeds used for the normal course of business operations.

      (1)  Lenders are not required to obtain Agency approval prior to releasing collateral when the collateral sale proceeds are used to pay down debt in order of lien priority, pay down the guaranteed loan principal, or to acquire replacement collateral.

      (2)  Current appraisals are required on all transactions pursuant to the requirements of § 5001.203 of this part.

      (3)  The sale or release of collateral must be based on an arm's length transaction, unless otherwise approved, in writing, by the Agency when the sale or release of collateral results in paying the guaranteed loan in full and termination of the loan note guarantee. There must be adequate consideration at market value for the release of collateral. Such consideration may include, but is not limited to:

      (i) Application of the net proceeds from the sale of collateral to the borrower's debts in order of their lien priority against the sold collateral;

      (ii) Use of the net proceeds from the sale of collateral to purchase other collateral of equal or greater value which the lender will obtain as security for the benefit of the guaranteed loan with a lien position equal or superior to the position previously held;

      (iii) Application of the net proceeds from the sale of collateral to the borrower's guaranteed loan or to its business operation in such a manner that a significant improvement to the borrower's debt service ability will be clearly demonstrated. The lender's written request must detail how the borrower's debt service ability will be improved; and

      (4)  Any release of collateral must not materially cause an adverse effect to the project's operation or financial condition and the remaining collateral must be sufficient to provide for adequate collateral coverage. Such assurance must be supported by written documentation from the lender and be acceptable to the Agency. If the Agency determines that the project may be adversely affected by a release of collateral, the Agency may, at its discretion, require an appraisal on the remaining collateral in accordance with § 5001.203 of this part.

      § 5001.506   Loan transfers and assumptions.

#### § § 5001.506

      (a)  A lender must obtain prior written Agency approval in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section before the lender conducts a transfer and assumption of a guaranteed loan. The transferee will assume a loan amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance or the present market value of the collateral, whichever is less. If the transferor is to receive a payment for their equity, the total debt must be assumed. The following conditions must be met:

      (1) All transfers and assumptions will have a fee as provided by § 5001.509(b).

      (2) For each transfer and assumption, the lender must concur in plans for the disposition of funds, if any, in the transferor's debt service, operations and maintenance, or other reserve accounts.

      (3) The lender must confirm that the transfer and assumption can be completed in accordance with applicable laws.

      (4) The lender must confirm that the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, and recorded as appropriate and legally permissible. The transfer and assumption must be made on the Lender's form of assumption agreement and contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee. The lender must provide the Agency with a copy of the assumption agreement.

      (5) The lender may request a transfer and assumption when the total indebtedness, or less than the total indebtedness, of the guaranteed loan is assumed by another borrower. If the assumption is for less than the total indebtedness, the transfer and assumption must be an arm's length transaction and the transfer must be of all loan collateral.

      (6) In the event of default of the guaranteed loan, a transfer and assumption of the borrower's operation and guaranteed loan can be accomplished before or after the loan goes into liquidation. However, if the collateral has been purchased through foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed title to the lender, no transfer and assumption is permitted.

      (7) No transfer and assumption is permitted when the Agency has repurchased any guaranteed portion of the guaranteed portion of the loan.

      (8) If the transfer is for less than the total indebtedness, the pro rata share of an eligible loss will be paid to the lender after execution of the transfer and assumption documents.

      (b)  The lender will provide to the Agency documentation to support the transferee's status as an eligible borrower, and such other documentation as the Agency may request to determine eligibility and credit evaluation.

      (1) The new borrower must sign an Agency-approved application form.

      (2) The Agency will require personal and/or corporate guarantee(s) in accordance with § 5001.204 of this part, as applicable. Any required new personal, partnership or corporate guarantors of the transferred guaranteed loan must sign an Agency approved guarantee form.

      (c)  The Agency will only approve a transfer and assumption if the transferee will continue the eligible purpose of the guaranteed loan and such transfer and assumption complies with the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.

      (1) Whenever the transferor and transferee are affiliates or related parties, the transfer and assumption must:

      (i) Be to an eligible borrower to continue the project for eligible purposes;

      (ii) Transfer all the loan collateral; and

      (iii) Be for the full amount of the guaranteed loan indebtedness.

      (2) A transfer and assumption may be approved when the present borrower is unable or unwilling to accomplish the objectives of the guaranteed loan, and the transfer will be in the best financial interest of the borrower and the Agency.

      (3) The Agency prefers to transfer to an eligible borrower subject to the policies and procedures governing the type of guaranteed loan being made, however the Agency will consider approving a transfer of a guaranteed loan to an ineligible borrower only if:

      (i) The sale price is greater than it would be if the transfer was to an eligible borrower;

      (ii) The transfer to an ineligible borrower is needed as a method for servicing a problem case; or

      (iii) When an eligible borrower is not available. All transfers to an ineligible borrower must meet the following requirements:

      (A) Transfer fees will be collected, and payments applied, in accordance with § 5001.509(b);

      (B) The ineligible borrower agrees to pay the loan balance within the remaining term of the original guaranteed loan in periodic installments that will not result in a balloon payment at the loan's maturity;

      (C) Interest rates are at the rate specified in the promissory note of the transferor or at rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business. The rates can be either fixed or variable, and are subject to Agency review and approval;

      (D) The ineligible borrower must have the legal authority to enter into the contract and have the ability to repay the loan, as determined by the lender and the Agency. The ineligible borrower must submit a current balance sheet to the lender. The lender must obtain and analyze the credit history of the ineligible borrower.

      (d)  The transferor, including any guarantor, can be released from liability only with prior Agency written approval when the transfer and assumption is for the full outstanding balance of the guaranteed loan. If the assumption is for less than the full amount of the loan and the Agency pays a loss to the lender, the transferor, including any guarantor, are specifically subject to the Debt Collection Improvement Act provisions unless other workout arrangements have been made.

      (e)  A new loan agreement or an assumption agreement, acceptable to the Agency must be executed to establish the terms and conditions of the loan being assumed.

      (f)  When a transfer or assumption is made to an eligible borrower continuing the project for eligible purposes, the loan terms may remain the same or may be changed whether the transfer is for the total indebtedness or less than the total indebtedness. If the loan terms are to be changed, the lender must submit a request in accordance with this paragraph (f). The changed loan terms must be concurred to by the Agency, all holders, and the transferee (including guarantors). If there are changes in loan terms, the lender's request will require the following:

      (1) An explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in the loan terms, and

      (2) Certification that the lien position securing the guaranteed loan will be maintained or improved, and proper insurances will continue to be in effect.

      (g)  The lender is responsible for noting each transfer and assumption on all originals of the loan note guarantee.

      (h)  Before the transfer and assumption is closed, the lender must credit any proceeds received from the sale of collateral to the transferor's guaranteed loan debt in order of lien priority.

      (i)  Guaranteed loans may be used to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption. The Agency will consider approving a guaranteed loan to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption pursuant to the lender's submission of a complete application in accordance with 7 CFR part 5001, subpart D.

      (j)  The lender must make a complete credit evaluation in accordance with § 5001.202 of this part to determine viability of the project (subject to the Agency review and approval) including any requirement for deposits in an escrow account as security to meet the applicable equity requirements for the project.

      (k)  If the proposed transfer and assumption is for less than the full amount of the guaranteed loan, an appraisal is required on all the collateral being transferred, and the amount of the assumption must not be less than this appraised value. The lender is responsible for obtaining the appraisal, which must conform to the requirements of § 5001.203 of this part. However, if the original appraisal is more than one year old, but less than two years old, the lender may provide an appraisal with a new effective date of evaluation in lieu of a completely new appraisal.

      (l)  Prior to Agency approval, the lender must provide the Agency a preliminary written legal opinion that the guaranteed loan can be properly and legally transferred and assurance that the conveyance instruments will be appropriately filed, registered, and recorded. Upon execution of the transfer and assumption, the lender must provide the Agency with a final legal opinion that the assumption is completed, valid, and enforceable, and the assumption is consistent with the conditions outlined in the Agency's conditions of approval for the transfer and complies with all Agency regulations.

      (m)  The lender must not issue any new promissory notes, release any mortgages and/or deeds of trust on the existing debt being transferred. An allonge may be attached to existing promissory notes as needed.

      (n)  (1) Any resulting loss must be processed in accordance with § 5001.521.

      (2) If a holder owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, such portion must be repurchased by the lender or the Agency in accordance with § 5001.511.

      (o)  The lender may allow the transferee to make cash down payments directly to the transferor provided:

      (1) The transfer and assumption are made for the total indebtedness to an eligible borrower to continue the project for eligible purposes;

      (2) The lender recommends that the cash be released, and the Agency concurs prior to the assumption being completed. The lender can require that an amount be retained for a defined period of time as a reserve against future defaults. Interest on such account may be paid periodically to the transferor or transferee as agreed; and

      (3) The lender determines that the transferee has the repayment ability to meet the obligations of the assumed guaranteed loan as well as any other indebtedness.

      (p)  The Agency will deem that a transfer and assumption has occurred whenever there is a significant change in the control of the borrower.

      § 5001.507   Lender transfer.

#### § § 5001.507

      (a) After the issuance of a loan note guarantee, a lender may sell or transfer the entire loan to a new lender with prior written approval of the Agency. The Agency may approve the sale or transfer to a new lender if the following conditions are met. The new lender:

      (1) Is an eligible lender in accordance with § 5001.130 of this part and is approved as such;

      (2) Is able to service the loan in accordance with the original loan documents;

      (3) Agrees in writing to acquire title to the unguaranteed portion of the loan held by the original lender and assumes all original loan requirements, including liabilities and servicing responsibilities; and

      (4) The transfer to the new lender is requested in writing by the borrower, the proposed new lender, and the original lender of record, if still in existence.

      (b) Upon Agency approval, the original lender must transfer to the new lender the:

      (1) Original promissory note and loan security documents;

      (2) Original loan note guarantee;

      (3) Original personal and corporate guarantee(s);

      (4) Loan payment history; and

      (v) The new lender must agree to accept the current loan terms, including the interest rate, secondary market holder (if any), collateral, loan agreement terms, and guarantors. The new lender can modify the loan terms after acquisition only by submitting a written request to the Agency and receiving Agency approval.

      (vi) The new lender must certify to the Agency that the loan transfer has been completed in accordance with applicable laws and all provisions of the original loan remain in full force and effect.

      (c) The Agency will not pay any loss or share in any costs ( legal fees, appraisal fees and environmental assessments) for a voluntary transfer of lender. This includes situations where a lender is merged with or acquired by another lender and situations where the lender has failed and been taken over by a Federal regulatory agency such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the loan is subsequently sold to another lender. However, in situations where the lender has failed and been taken over by a Federal regulator and the loan is liquidated rather than being sold to another lender, the Agency will pay losses and share in costs as if the Federal regulatory agency were an approved new lender.

      (d) In cases when there is a transfer to a new lender or when a lender has been merged with or acquired by another lender, the Agency and the new lender must execute a new lender's agreement, unless the new lender already has a valid lender's agreement with the Agency.

      (e) After Agency approval of a transfer of lender, all terms of the original loan note guarantee shall transfer to the benefit of the new lender.

      § 5001.508   Mergers.

#### § § 5001.508

      All borrower mergers or consolidations (herein referred to as “mergers”) require approval by the Agency and the lender. The Agency may approve a merger when—

      (a) The resulting organization will be eligible for a guaranteed loan and assumes all the liabilities and acquires all the assets of the merged borrower;

      (b) The merger is in the best interest of the government and the merging organization;

      (c) The resulting organization can meet all required conditions as contained in specific loan agreements; and

      (d) All property can be legally transferred to the resulting organization.

      § 5001.509   Servicing fees.

#### § § 5001.509

      The lender may pass the servicing fees on to the borrower but may not delay payment of the fee to the Agency while collecting the payment from the borrower.

      (a)  Where the lender is required to pay a periodic guarantee retention fee (see § 5001.455), the fee is due for the entire payment period even if the loan note guarantee is terminated or transferred before the next retention fee payment is due.

      (b) Borrower  The Agency will charge the following fees:

      (1) A one-time, $1,500 nonrefundable transfer fee at the time of transfer to an eligible borrower.

      (2) Payment of a one-time nonrefundable transfer fee of 1 percent of the guaranteed loan balance to ineligible borrowers.

      § 5001.510   Subordination of lien position.

#### § § 5001.510

      (a)  A lender seeking a subordination of its lien position in collateral must submit a written request to the Agency. The lender must include in the request a financial analysis of the servicing action. The financial analysis must be fully supported by current financial statements, less than 90 calendar days old, of the borrower and guarantors. The lender must receive written Agency approval prior to the subordination.

      (b)  Agency approval of the subordination request requires that:

      (1) The subordination of the lender's lien position enhances the borrower's business and is in the best financial interest of the Agency;

      (2) The lien to which the guaranteed loan is subordinated is for a fixed dollar amount or fixed credit limit and for a fixed term, after which the guaranteed loan lien priority will be restored;

      (3) Remaining collateral is sufficient to provide for adequate collateral coverage of the guaranteed loan after taking into account the lender's discount of collateral consistent with the lender's sound loan-to-discounted value practices and satisfactory justification of the discount used. The Agency may require a current independent appraisal in accordance with § 5001.203. However, if the original appraisal is more than one year old, but less than two years old, the lender may provide an appraisal with a new effective date of evaluation in lieu of a completely new appraisal;

      (4) Lien priorities remain for the portion of the loan collateral that was not subordinated;

      (5) The subordination of collateral to a line of credit does not extend beyond the term of the line of credit and in no event exceeds more than three years.

      (6) Subordination to a tax-exempt obligation is strictly prohibited in compliance with OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.”

      § 5001.511   Repurchases from holders.

#### § § 5001.511

      (a)  A holder can make written demand on either the lender or the Agency to repurchase the unpaid guarantee portion of the loan when the borrower is in monetary default or when the lender has failed to pay the holder its pro-rata share of any payment made by the borrower within 30 days of the lender's receipt thereof from the borrower. When making written demand on the lender, the holder must concurrently send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency.

      (1) The lender is encouraged to repurchase the guarantee, upon written demand of a holder, to facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve any loan problem, and resolve the monetary default, where and when reasonable. The benefit to the lender is that it may re-assign the guaranteed portion of the loan and then continue collection of its servicing fee, if any, when the monetary default is cured.

      (2) When a lender receives a written demand for repurchase from a holder, the lender must notify any other holder and the Agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written demand. The lender must inform all parties if the lender will repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the requesting holder.

      (3) Upon repurchase the holder will re-assign the assignment guarantee agreement to the lender without recourse.

      (b)  If the lender, borrower, and holder are unable to agree to restructuring of loan repayment, interest rate, or loan terms to resolve any loan problem or resolve any default and repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to adequately service the loan, the holder must reassign the guaranteed portion of the loan to the lender. The reassignment must be for an amount not less than the holder's unpaid principal and accrued interest, in accordance with § 5001.450(c) of this part, on such portion less the lender's servicing fee.

      (1) Upon repurchase the holder will re-assign the assignment guarantee agreement to the lender without recourse.

      (2) The lender must not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage or other purposes to further its own financial gain.

      (3) Any repurchase from a holder may only be made after the lender obtains the Agency's written approval.

      (c)  If the lender does not repurchase the guaranteed portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its option, purchase such guaranteed portion of the loan for loan servicing purposes. A holder can submit a written demand to the Agency for repurchase only if the lender declines to repurchase. If a prior written demand was not made upon the lender, the Agency will notify the lender and allow up to seven calendar days for the lender to exercise their option to repurchase as provided in this section.

      (1)  If the lender does not repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of a loan as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will, within 30 calendar days after written demand to the Agency from the holder, purchase from the holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of repurchase or the interest termination date, whichever is sooner, less the lender's servicing fee. The guarantee will pay accrued interest to the holder on the loan as determined under § 5001.450(c) of this part.

      (2)  The holder must include in its written demand to the Agency:

      (i) A copy of the written demand made upon the lender;

      (ii) A copy of the lender's denial to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan;

      (iii) Evidence of the right to require payment from the Agency as provided by the holder or duly authorized agent. Such evidence must consist of the original assignment guarantee agreement properly assigned to the Agency without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan;

      (iv) The amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand, and interest subsequently accruing from date of demand to proposed payment date; and

      (v) When the initial holder has assigned its interest, the original assignment guarantee agreement and an original of each Agency-approved reassignment document in the chain of ownership, with the latest reassignment being assigned to the Agency without recourse, including all rights, title, and interest in the guarantee.

      (3)  Unless otherwise agreed upon, payment will not be later than 30 calendar days from the date of demand.

      (i) Upon request by the Agency, the lender must promptly furnish (within 30 calendar days of such request) a current statement, certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the lender, of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by the borrower on the loan and the amount then owed to any holder, along with the information necessary for the Agency to determine the appropriate amount due the holder.

      (ii) Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved between the lender and the holder before payment will be approved. The Agency will notify both parties and such conflict will suspend the running of the 30-calendar-day payment requirement.

      (iii) If a repurchase of a guaranteed loan includes the capitalization of interest, interest accrued on the capitalized interest will not be paid to the holder.

      (4)  When the Agency purchases a loan from a holder it assumes all rights that were previously held by the holder.

      (5)  When the Agency purchases the guaranteed portion of the loan from a holder, the lender's servicing fee will stop on the date that interest was last paid by the borrower. The lender can neither charge a servicing fee to the Agency nor collect such fee from the Agency.

      (6)  If the Agency repurchases 100 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan and becomes the holder, interest accrual on the loan will cease until the lender resumes remittance of the pro rata payments to the Agency.

      (7)  When a guaranteed loan has been delinquent more than 60 calendar days and no holder comes forward or when the lender has accelerated the account, and subject to the expiration of any forbearance or workout agreement, the lender, or the Agency at its sole discretion, must issue a letter to the holder(s) establishing the interest termination date in accordance with § 5001.450(c)(2).

      (8)  Purchase by the Agency neither changes, alters, or modifies any of the lender's obligations to the Agency arising from the lender's agreement, guaranteed loan or loan note guarantee, nor does it waive any of the Agency's rights against the lender. The Agency will have the right to set-off against the lender all rights inuring to the Agency as the holder of the instrument against the Agency's obligation to the lender under the loan note guarantee.

      (9)  When the lender has accelerated the loan and the lender holds all or a portion of the guaranteed loan, an estimated loss claim must be filed by the lender with the Agency within 60 calendar days from the date the loan was accelerated. Accrued interest paid to the lender in accordance with § 5001.450(c)(1).

      (10)  When a borrower files a Chapter 7 liquidation plan, the lender shall immediately notify the Agency and submit a liquidation plan. The Agency will establish an interest termination date based on the date interest was last paid to the lender. When a borrower files either a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring plan, the Agency and lender shall meet to discuss the bankruptcy procedure, the ability of the borrower to meet their restructuring plan, the lender's treatment of accruing interest, and potentially establish an interest termination date for the guaranteed loan. If the restructuring bankruptcy Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 is converted to a liquidation bankruptcy Chapter 7 by court order, the interest termination date will be the date of such conversion.

      § 5001.512   Additional expenditures and loans.

#### § § 5001.512

      The lender shall not make additional expenditures on behalf of, or provide new loans to, the borrower without notification to the Agency even though such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed. The lender shall not approve additional expenditures or new loans where the expenditure or loan will violate, or cause a violation of, any of the loan covenants in the borrower's loan agreement.

      § 5001.513   Interest rate changes.

#### § § 5001.513

      (a)  The guaranteed loan interest rate will freeze at the earliest uncured default date and will remain unchanged until the cancellation of the loan note guarantee in compliance with § 5001.524.

      (b)  The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written agreement among these parties. After a permanent reduction, the loan note guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate.

      (1) When the Agency is a holder, the lender must obtain Agency approval before implementing the reduction. The lender must provide a copy of the modification agreement to the Agency for approval. The Agency will approve the reduction only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the government's financial interests are not adversely affected.

      (2) Factors that the Agency will consider in determining whether to approve the change are the Government's cost of borrowing money; the monetary recovery is greater than the liquidation recovery; and the project's continued viability as demonstrated by a financial feasibility analysis.

      (c)  Unless a temporary interest rate reduction occurred, increases in fixed interest rates and increases in variable interest rate structure are prohibited.

      (d)  Fixed rates can be changed to variable rates to reduce the borrower's interest rate only when the variable rate has a ceiling that is less than or equal to the original fixed rate.

      (e)  Variable rates can be changed to a fixed rate at the request of the borrower, agreement of the holder, if any, and Agency concurrence.

      (f)  The interest rates, after adjustments, must comply with the requirements for interest rates on new loans as established by paragraph § 5001.401.

      (g)  The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest rate changes by an endorsement or any other legally effective amendment to the promissory note; however, no new promissory notes can be issued. The lender must provide copies of all such documents to the Agency within 10 calendar days of the change.

      (3) In a final loss settlement when qualifying interest rate changes are made in compliance with this part, the lender must calculate interest based on the periods the given rates were in effect. The lender must maintain records that adequately document the accrued interest claimed, which must be determined in accordance with § 5001.450(c).

      § 5001.514   Lender failure.

#### § § 5001.514

      (a)  In the event a lender fails or ceases to service a guaranteed loan, the Agency will make the successor lending entity aware of the statutory and regulatory requirements and will provide instruction to the successor lending entity on a case-by-case basis. Such instructions may include the Agency's determination that the Agency will service the entire loan or the guaranteed portion of the loan.

      (1) Any successor lender must take such action that a reasonable lender would take if it did not have a loan note guarantee to protect the lender and Agency's mutual interest.

      (2) A successor entity approved by the Agency as a lender will be afforded the benefits of the loan note guarantee in the sharing of any loss and eligible expenses subject to the limits that are set forth in the regulations governing the loan guarantee.

      (b)  If the successor lending entity is a non-regulated lender, the lending entity is prohibited from making changes to the lender's agreement and related documents on the guaranteed loan. The successor lending entity must comply with the provisions of this part, including promptly applying to become a lender if not already an eligible lender. If the successor lending entity is not or fails to become a lender as set forth in § 5001.130 of this part within 60 calendar days, the loan note guarantee will not be enforceable.

      (c)  Where the failed lending entity is an FDIC regulated lender, the FDIC and the Agency will enter into an Inter-Agency Agreement regarding the FDIC's role as the successor lending entity, and all parties are to abide by this agreement or successor document(s). This agreement sets forth the duties and responsibilities of each Agency when a lender fails. When the FDIC is not the successor to a failed regulated lender, the regulatory agency serving as the successor lending entity and the Agency will abide by terms of the lender's agreement as executed by the originating lender. The Agency reserves the right to request a meeting with the successor lending entity to further define the duties and responsibilities of each agency when a lender fails.

      (d)  In the event no successor lending entity can be determined, the Agency reserves the right to enforce the provisions of the loan documents on behalf of the lender or to purchase the lender's interest in the loan.

      § 5001.515   Default by borrower.

#### § § 5001.515

      When there is a default by a borrower, the lender must act prudently and expeditiously in working with the borrower to bring the account current or cure the default through restructuring if a realistic plan can be developed, or to accelerate the account and conduct a liquidation in accordance with § 5001.517 and in a manner that will minimize any potential loss.

      (a)  The lender must notify the Agency within the timeframe as provided in § 5001.502(a)(3)(i).

      (1) The lender will provide this notification by submitting the guaranteed loan borrower default status report in the Agency's electronic reporting system. The lender must update the loan's status each month until such time as the loan is no longer in default.

      (2) If a monetary default exceeds 30 calendar days, the lender must meet with the borrower and, if necessary, the Agency within 45 calendar days of the date of the default to discuss the situation. The lender must provide the Agency with a written summary of the meeting, including any decisions and actions agreed upon within 10 calendar days of the meeting.

      (b)  In considering curative actions, providing a permanent cure without adversely affecting the risk to the Agency and the lender is the paramount objective. The lender may consider temporary curative actions ( payment deferments or collateral subordination) provided they strengthen the loan and are in the best financial interest of the lender and the Agency.

      (1) Curative actions (subject to the rights of any holder and Agency concurrence) include, but are not limited to, the following options:

      (i) Deferment of principal and/or interest payments;

      (ii) An additional unguaranteed temporary loan by the lender to bring the account current;

      (iii) Re-amortization of or rescheduling the payments on the loan excluding capitalization of accrued interest;

      (iv) Transfer and assumption of the loan in accordance with § 5001.506;

      (v) Reorganization;

      (vi) Liquidation;

      (vii) Changes in interest rates in accordance with § 5001.513. Any interest payments must be adjusted proportionately between the guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the loan; and

      (viii) Troubled debt restructure.

      (2) The term of any deferment, rescheduling, re-amortization, or moratorium cannot exceed the lesser of the remaining useful life of the collateral or remaining term of the loan as set forth in § 5001.402(b) of this part.

      (i) During a period of deferment or moratorium on the guaranteed loan, the lender's non-guaranteed loan(s) and any stockholder or affiliate loans must also be under deferment or moratorium.

      (ii) Balloon payments are permitted as a loan servicing option as long as there is a reasonable prospect for successful repayment of the guaranteed loan and the remaining life of the collateral supports the action.

      § 5001.516   Protective advances.

#### § § 5001.516

      Protective advances are allowed only when they are necessary to preserve the value of the collateral. Therefore, a lender must exercise sound judgment in determining that the protective advance preserves collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.

      (a) Protective advances must be reasonable with respect to the outstanding loan amount and the value of the collateral being preserved.

      (b) A lender cannot make protective advances in lieu of additional loans.

      (c) A lender must obtain written Agency approval for any protective advance that will cumulatively amount to more than $200,000, or 10 percent of the aggregate outstanding balance of principal and interest, whichever is less, to the same borrower. Payment of real estate taxes by the lender is considered a protective advance, subject to the requirements of this section, and does not require Agency advance approval.

      (d) Protective advances constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and must be secured by collateral to the same extent as the original guaranteed loan. It is the lender's responsibility to ensure that any protective advances are secured by the collateral of the guaranteed loan.

      (e) Notwithstanding § 5001.22(c) of this part, upon Agency approval, protective advances can be used to pay Federal tax liens or other Federal debt.

      (f) A Protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final payment as indicated in the report of loss. In the event of a final loss, protective advances may accrue interest at the promissory note rate from the date of such advance and will be guaranteed at the same percentage of loss as provided for in the loan note guarantee. The loan note guarantee will not cover interest on the protective advance accruing after the interest termination date.

      (g) The maximum loss to be paid by the Agency will never exceed the original loan amount plus accrued interest times the percentage of guarantee regardless of any protective advances made.

      (h) Holders do not have an interest in protective advances.

> [85 FR 42518, July 14, 2020, as amended at 89 FR 79728, Sept. 30, 2024; 89 FR 97477, Dec. 9, 2024]

      § 5001.517   Liquidation.

#### § § 5001.517

      In the event of one or more incidents of default or third-party actions that the borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time, the lender, with Agency consent, must provide for liquidation in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section. The lender is responsible for initiating actions immediately and as necessary to assure a prompt, orderly liquidation that will provide maximum recovery. The Agency reserves the right to unilaterally conclude that liquidation is necessary and require the lender to assign the collateral to the Agency and the Agency will then liquidate the loan per paragraph (o) of this section.

      (a)  A decision to liquidate a loan or proceed otherwise must be made when the lender determines that the default cannot be cured or when the Agency and the lender determine that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the lender to liquidate. The decision to liquidate or proceed otherwise with the borrower must be made as soon as possible when one or more of the following exist:

      (1) The loan is 90 calendar days behind on any scheduled payment and the lender and the borrower have not been able to cure the delinquency;

      (2) Delaying liquidation will jeopardize full or maximum recovery on the loan; or

      (3) The borrower or lender is uncooperative in resolving the problem or the Agency or lender has reason to believe the borrower is not acting in good faith, and immediate liquidation would minimize loss to the Agency.

      (b)  When the decision to liquidate a loan is made, if any portion of the loan has been sold or assigned under § 5001.408 of this part and has not already been repurchased, the lender must make provisions for repurchase in accordance with § 5001.511.

      (c)  Within 30 calendar days after the lender decides to liquidate a loan, the lender must submit a written, proposed plan of liquidation to the Agency for approval. The liquidation plan must be detailed and include at least the following information:

      (1) Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note and related security instruments. Such proof may include copies of executed notes; and copies of mortgages or deeds of trust recorded in the appropriate jurisdiction;

      (2) A copy of the payment ledger, if available, or other documentation that reflects the current outstanding loan balance, accrued interest to date, and the method of computing the accrued interest. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of changes in the agreed upon base rate and when the changes in the loan rate became effective.

      (3) A full and complete list of all collateral and a listing of all liens held and status of such liens, plus any personal and corporate guarantees;

      (4) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such methods, including recommended action for acquiring and disposing of all collateral and collecting from guarantors;

      (5) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral including any anticipated protective advances;

      (6) The market value and the potential liquidation value, or estimates thereof, of all the collateral securing the loan.

      (i) These values or estimates of the collateral must be obtained by the lender through an independent appraisal. If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is less than $250,000, the lender may, instead of an appraisal, obtain these values or estimates by using their primary regulator's policies relating to appraisals and evaluations or, if the lender is not regulated, normal banking practices and generally accepted methods of determining value. A copy of the appraisal or valuation will be provided to the Agency with the liquidation plan or as soon as it is available.

      (ii) The procedure used to obtain these values or estimates of the collateral must include an evaluation of the impact of any release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental hazards.

      (iii) Any independent appraiser's fee, including the cost of the environmental site assessment if necessary, will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender;

      (7) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at auction and a description to show how the amounts were determined.

      (i) A protective bid can be made by the lender, with prior Agency written approval, at a foreclosure sale to protect the lender's and the Agency's interest.

      (ii) The protective bid must not exceed the amount of the loan balance plus applicable foreclosure expenses and must be based on the liquidation value and estimated net recovery considering prior liens and outstanding taxes, expenses of foreclosure, and estimated expenses for holding and reselling the property. Foreclosure expenses include, but are not limited to, expenses for resale, interest accrual, length of time necessary for resale, maintenance, guard service, weatherization, and prior liens;

      (8) Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements;

      (9) Copies of each guarantor's latest available financial statements;

      (10) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to be incurred along with justification for each expense. These may include attorney, auctioneer, and other professional fees for services the lender will need to contract to maximize recovery on the loan. Cost could also include legal representation to protect Agency/lender joint interest in bankruptcy or receivership;

      (11) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification. Protective advances include, but are not limited to, advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard and flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral, and other expenses necessary to protect the collateral. Protective advances may include advances necessary to maintain services or address unique situations with proper justification. If the lender has advanced funds without agency approval during the life of the loan, such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed;

      (12) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to be credited to the guaranteed debt;

      (13) Legal opinions, if needed by the lender's legal counsel; and

      (14) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of liquidation, not to exceed every 60 days.

      (d)  If actions are necessary to immediately preserve and protect the collateral, the lender may submit a partial liquidation plan and, when approved by the Agency, submit a complete liquidation plan prepared by the lender in accordance with  of this section.

      (e)  The lender cannot implement its liquidation plan before obtaining written approval from the Agency. The Agency will approve or disapprove the plan within 30 calendar days of its receipt. In order to ensure prompt action, the lender may submit its liquidation plan with an estimate of collateral value, and the Agency may approve the liquidation plan subject to the results of the final liquidation appraisal.

      (1) If the Agency approves the lender's liquidation plan, the lender must:

      (i) Proceed expeditiously with liquidation. The lender must actively market the collateral for a reasonable period of time. If after this period of time the lender is unable to sell the collateral, then consideration should be given to submission of a final loss claim based on the fair market value of the collateral prior to its ultimate disposition;

      (ii) Take all legal action necessary to liquidate the loan in accordance with the approved liquidation plan; and

      (iii) Update or modify the liquidation plan when conditions warrant, including a change in value based on a liquidation appraisal.

      (iv) If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the lender must obtain the Agency's written approval prior to proceeding with the proposed changes if the revised liquidation costs exceed 10 percent of the amount proposed in the liquidation plan approved by the Agency.

      (2) If the Agency does not approve the lender's liquidation plan, the Agency will meet with the lender to resolve the concern(s). Until the concerns are resolved, the lender must take such actions that a reasonable lender would take without a guarantee and keep the Agency informed, in writing, of those actions. Once the revised liquidation plan is approved by the Agency, the lender must proceed in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

      (f)  The lender must proceed to accelerate the loan as expeditiously as possible when acceleration is necessary, including giving any notices and taking any other required legal actions. The guaranteed loan will be considered in liquidation once it has been accelerated and a demand for payment has been made upon the borrower.

      (1) If the sole basis for acceleration is a non-monetary default, the lender must obtain concurrence from the Agency prior to accelerating the loan. In the case of monetary default, the lender may accelerate the loan without prior approval by the Agency, although Agency concurrence must still be given no later than the time the Agency approves the liquidation plan.

      (2) The lender must provide the Agency a copy of the acceleration notice, or other acceleration document sent to the borrower.

      (g)  If the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any or all the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender must file an estimated loss claim once a decision has been made to liquidate if the liquidation will exceed 90 calendar days. The Agency will process the estimated loss claim and will make final loss payments in accordance with § 5001.521.

      (h)  (1) The guarantee will not cover liquidation expenses in excess of liquidation proceeds under any circumstances.

      (2) When a liquidation is performed by the lender, the Agency must approve, in advance and in writing, the lender's estimated liquidation expenses of collateral.

      (3) Liquidation expenses must be reasonable and customary and must provide a demonstrated economic benefit to the lender and the Agency. The lender and Agency will share liquidation expenses equally. To accomplish this, the lender must deduct 50 percent of the liquidation expenses from the collateral sale proceeds.

      (i)  The lender must account for funds during the period of liquidation and must provide the Agency with reports on the progress of liquidation including disposition of collateral and resulting costs. If in the course of implementing the approved liquidation plan the lender determines additional procedures are necessary for the successful completion of the liquidation or otherwise makes any other changes to or deviations from the approved liquidation plan, the lender must identify in the report such procedures, changes, and deviations.

      (j)  When the Agency is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan, the lender must transmit to the Agency within 14 calendar days the Agency's pro rata share of any payments received from the borrower, liquidation, or other proceeds using an Agency approved form.

      (k)  (1) Disposition of collateral acquired by the lender must be approved, in writing, by the Agency when—

      (i) The lender's cost to acquire the collateral of a borrower exceeds the potential recovery value of the security and the lender proposes abandoning the collateral in lieu of liquidation; or

      (ii) The acquired collateral is to be sold to the borrower, affiliates or members of the borrower or to borrower's stockholders or officers, or the lender or lender's stockholders or officers.

      (2) A recommendation by the lender for abandonment of collateral is considered a servicing action under 7 CFR 1970.8(e) and a separate NEPA review is not required.

      (l)  The lender must take action to maximize recovery from all personal and corporate guarantees, including seeking deficiency judgments when there is a reasonable chance of future collection.

      (m)  Compromise settlements must be approved by the lender and the Agency. The lender must provide complete current financial information on all parties obligated for the loan. At a minimum, the compromise settlement must be equivalent to the value and timeliness of that which would be received from attempting to collect on the guarantee. Any guarantor cannot be released from liability until the full amount of the compromise settlement has been received. In determining whether to approve a compromise settlement, the Agency will consider, among other things, whether the compromise is more financially advantageous than collecting on the guarantee.

      (n)  (1) If a lender has made a loan guaranteed under one of the programs identified in § 5001.1 of this part, the lender has the option to liquidate the loan under the provisions of this part or under the entire provisions of applicable regulation at the time the loan was guaranteed by the Agency.

      (2) The lender must notify the Agency in writing within 10 calendar days after its decision to liquidate as to which regulatory provisions it chooses to use. If the lender does not notify the Agency in writing within these 10 calendar days, it must use the liquidation provisions in this part.

      (o)  The Agency will liquidate a guaranteed loan at its option only when it is a holder and there is reason to believe the lender is not likely to undertake liquidation efforts that will result in maximum recovery. When it conducts a liquidation, the Agency will apply proceeds derived from the sale of the collateral first to reasonable liquidation expenses and second to the guaranteed portion of the loan.

      § 5001.518   [Reserved]

#### § § 5001.518

      § 5001.519   Bankruptcy.

#### § § 5001.519

      (a)  The lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan and the collateral securing it in bankruptcy and any related appellate proceedings. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (1) Taking actions that result in greater recoveries and avoiding actions that are likely not to be cost-effective;

      (2) Monitoring confirmed bankruptcy plans to determine borrower compliance, and, if the borrower fails to comply, pursuing appropriate relief, including seeking a dismissal of the bankruptcy plan;

      (3) Requesting modifications of any proposed bankruptcy plan whenever it appears that the lender could obtain additional recoveries via plan modification;

      (4) Filing a proof of claim, when necessary, and all the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case;

      (5) Attending and, when necessary, participating in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings;

      (6) Immediately seeking adequate protection of the collateral if it is subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy or the debtor in possession;

      (7) When appropriate, seeking involuntary conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a liquidation proceeding or seeking dismissal of the proceedings;

      (8) Submitting a default status report within 15 calendar days after the date when the borrower defaults and every 30 calendar days thereafter until the default is resolved or a final loss claim is paid by the Agency; and

      (9) Informing the Agency within 10 working days upon notification of the filing of a bankruptcy case and keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed, in writing, of all aspects of the proceedings, at a minimum, on a bi-monthly basis.

      (b)  In a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 reorganization, the lender must obtain an independent appraisal of the collateral if the Agency has determined that an independent appraisal is necessary. With written Agency consent, the lender and Agency will equally share the cost of any independent appraisal fee to protect the guaranteed loan in any bankruptcy proceedings.

      (c)  The Agency or the lender, with the approval of the Agency, can initiate the repurchase of the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder. If the lender is the holder, an estimated loss payment may be filed at the initiation of a Chapter 7 proceeding or after a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 proceeding becomes a liquidation proceeding. Any loss payment on loans in bankruptcy must be approved by the Agency.

      (d)  In bankruptcy proceedings, the lender must use the report of loss form for reporting all estimated and final loss determinations. Payment of loss claims will be made as provided in this section.

      (1)  (i) If a borrower has filed for bankruptcy and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender must request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. Only one estimated loss payment is allowed during the bankruptcy and any related appellate proceedings. The Agency will treat all subsequent claims of the lender during bankruptcy and any related appellate proceedings as revisions to the initial estimated loss. At its option, the Agency may process a revised estimated loss payment in accordance with any court-approved changes in the bankruptcy plan. Once the bankruptcy plan has been satisfactorily completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court-ordered interest rate reduction under the terms of the bankruptcy plan.

      (ii) The lender must use the report of loss to request an estimated loss payment and to revise any estimated loss payments during the bankruptcy plan. The estimated loss claim, as well as any revisions to this claim, must be accompanied by documentation to support the claim.

      (iii) Upon completion of a bankruptcy plan, the lender must—

      (A) Enter the data directly into the Agency's electronic system; and

      (B) Provide the Agency with the documentation necessary to determine whether the estimated loss paid equals the actual loss sustained. Where the actual loss sustained is different than the estimated loss paid, the difference will be handled in accordance with § 5001.521(h).

      (2)  (i) The lender must request a bankruptcy loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court for all bankruptcies when all or a portion of the debt has been discharged. Unless a final court decree approves a subsequent change to the bankruptcy plan that is adverse to the lender, only one bankruptcy loss payment is allowed during the bankruptcy. Once a final court decree has discharged all or part of the guaranteed loan and any appeal period has run, the lender must submit the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the bankruptcy loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest.

      (ii) The lender must use the report of loss to request a bankruptcy loss payment and to revise any bankruptcy loss payments during the course of the bankruptcy. The lender must include with the bankruptcy loss claim documentation to support the claim, as well as any revisions to this claim.

      (iii) Upon completion of a bankruptcy plan, restructure, or liquidation, the lender must enter the data directly into the Agency's electronic reporting system.

      (iv) If an estimated loss claim is paid during a bankruptcy and the borrower repays in full the remaining balance without an additional loss sustained by the lender, a final report of loss will be filed to terminate the loan.

      (3)  Interest losses as a result of bankruptcy reorganization will be paid as described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.

      (i) For guaranteed loans closed for which the Agency has not issued an interest termination letter—

      (A) The loss of interest income sustained during the period of the bankruptcy plan will be processed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

      (B) The loss of interest income sustained after the bankruptcy plan is confirmed will be processed annually when the lender sustains a loss as a result of a permanent interest rate reduction that extends beyond the period of the bankruptcy plan; and

      (C) If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the bankruptcy plan and the borrower repays in full the remaining balance without an additional loss sustained by the lender, a final report of loss will be filed to terminate the loan.

      (ii) For guaranteed loans closed for which the Agency has issued an interest termination letter, the Agency will not compensate the lender for any difference in the interest rate specified in the loan note guarantee and the rate of interest specified in the bankruptcy plan.

      (4)  The Agency will process final bankruptcy loss payments when the loan is fully liquidated.

      (5)  The lender must apply estimated loss payments first to the principal balance of the guaranteed portion of the debt and then to the interest of the guaranteed portion of the debt. In the event a court attempts to direct the payments to be applied in a different manner, the lender must immediately notify the Agency in writing.

      (6)  If approved protective advances, as authorized by § 5001.516, were incurred in connection with the initiation of liquidation action and were required to protect the collateral as result of delays in the case or failure of the borrower to maintain the security prior to the borrower having filed bankruptcy, the protective advances together with accrued interest, as determined under § 5001.450(c) of this part, are payable under the guarantee in the final loss claim.

      (e)  (1) The liquidation expenses will be in compliance with § 5001.517(h).

      (2) Reasonable and customary liquidation expenses in bankruptcy may be deducted from liquidation proceeds of collateral. In the case of Chapter 11 reorganizations or Chapters 11 or 7 liquidation, only expenses authorized by the court can be deducted from the collateral proceeds, unless the liquidation is by the lender.

      (3) When a bankruptcy proceeding results in a liquidation of the borrower by a bankruptcy trustee appointed under 11 U.S.C. 701, 702, 703, or 1104, expenses will be handled as directed by the court, and the lender cannot claim liquidation expenses for the sale of the assets.

      (4) If the property is abandoned by the bankruptcy trustee and any relief from the stay has been obtained, the lender will conduct the liquidation in accordance with § 5001.517.

      (5) Proceeds received from partial sale of collateral during bankruptcy can be used by the lender to pay reasonable costs ( freight, labor, and sales commissions) associated with the partial sale. Reasonable use of proceeds for this purpose must be documented with the final loss claim request.

      (6) Legal fees as a result of a bankruptcy are limited by the Agency to an amount not to exceed 3 percent of the current principal balance and are only recoverable from liquidation proceeds. Legal fees in excess of 3 percent of the current principal balance shall be borne by the lender and are not recoverable from liquidation proceeds or any loss claim by the lender.

      § 5001.520   Litigation.

#### § § 5001.520

      (a) In all litigation proceedings involving the borrower, the lender is responsible for protecting the rights of the lender and the Agency with respect to the loan and keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed, in writing, of all aspects of the proceedings. If the Agency determines that the lender is not adequately protecting the rights of the lender or the Agency with respect to the loan, the Agency reserves the right to take any legal action the Agency determines necessary to protect the rights of the lender and Agency, on behalf of the lender or the Agency. If the Agency exercises this right, the lender must cooperate with the Agency. The Agency will assess against the lender any cost the Agency incurs with such action.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Agency reserves the right to be represented by the U.S. Department of Justice in any litigation where the Agency is named as a party.

      § 5001.521   Loss calculations and payment.

#### § § 5001.521

      Unless the Agency anticipates a future recovery, the Agency will make a final settlement with the lender after the collateral is liquidated or after settlement and compromise of all parties has been completed. The Agency has the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party that may be liable.

      (a)  The lender must use the report of loss form for all estimated and final loss claim requests.

      (b)  The lender must submit to the Agency a completed report of loss form for all estimated loss claims. In calculating the estimated loss, the lender must use the estimated or current appraised liquidation value of the collateral.

      (c)  The Agency will approve estimated loss payments only after it has approved the lender's liquidation plan. For a loan which has been approved by the Agency for a debt write-down (or debt restructure), the maximum amount of loss payment will not exceed the percent of guarantee multiplied by the difference between the outstanding principal and interest balance of the loan before the write-down and the outstanding balance of the loan after the write-down.

      (1) The amount of an estimated loss payment must be credited first as a deduction from the principal balance of the loan with any remaining balance to accrued interest.

      (2) The estimated loss payment cannot be applied as a payment on the loan for purposes of reducing the unpaid balance owed by the borrower for status reporting or any debt collection actions against the borrower or any guarantors.

      (d)  (1) Negligent loan origination and negligent loan servicing will result in a reduction of loss claims payable under the guarantee to the lender if any losses have occurred as the result of such negligence. The Agency will assess against the lender any cost to the Agency associated with actions taken by the Agency necessary to protect the Agency's interests with respect to the loan where a lender is not in compliance with its origination and servicing responsibilities. The extent of the reduction, which could be a total reduction of the loss claims payable, will depend on the extent of the losses incurred as a result of the negligent loan origination or servicing.

      (2) Non-compliance with the requirements of  or  will result in a reduction of loss claims payable. The Agency's review of the non-compliance could result in a total reduction of the loss claim payable. The Agency's review of the non-compliance could result in a total reduction of the loss claim payable. The lender must ensure during loan making and project development that the project is designed utilizing accepted architectural and engineering practices and conforms to applicable Federal requirements including the seismic requirements of Executive Order 12699 (55 FR 835, January 5, 1990), State and local codes and requirements, and facility plans or plans and specifications reviewed and approved by the applicable State regulatory agency. The lender must also ensure that the planned project will be completed within the available funds and once completed, will be suitable for the borrower's needs.

      (3) Any delinquent fees, including any interest due thereon, will be deducted from any loss payment due the lender.

      (e)  Except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section, the lender must submit a final report of loss to the Agency within 30 calendar days after liquidation of all collateral is completed. The Agency will not guarantee interest beyond the interest termination date or this 30-day period, other than for the period of time it takes the Agency to process the loss claim. The lender must apply the total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency to the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. At the time of final loss settlement, the lender must notify the borrower that the loss payment has been so applied. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. Once the lender receives a final loss payment from the Agency, the Agency will collect any outstanding debts owed to the government in accordance with part 3 of this title.

      (1)  In the event of a loss, the loan note guarantee will not cover—

      (i) Interest to the lender accruing after the interest termination date;

      (ii) Any interest accrued as the result of the borrower's default on the guaranteed loan over and above that which would have accrued at the Agency-approved promissory note rate on the guaranteed loan ( default interest rate); or

      (iii) Any late fees, penalties, bond fees, interest rate swap charges, liquidation expenses, and other costs unless authorized under paragraph (e)(7) of this section.

      (2)  Before the Agency will approve a final report of loss, the lender must account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. The lender must document and show that all the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated, and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly on the loan.

      (3)  Upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, the Agency may audit all applicable documentation to determine the final loss. The lender must make its records available to and otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation or audit of the report of loss. The documentation accompanying the report of loss must support the amounts reported. The Agency must be satisfied that the lender has maximized the collections in conducting the liquidation.

      (4)  The lender must determine the collectability of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees required in accordance with § 5001.204 of this part. The lender must promptly collect or otherwise dispose of such guarantees prior to completion of the final loss report. However, if collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the lender must file the report of loss when all other collateral has been liquidated. Unsecured personal or corporate guarantees outstanding at the time of the submission of the final report of loss will be treated as a future recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a pro rata basis by the lender and the Agency.

      (5)  Any amounts paid by the Agency on account of liabilities of a borrower constitute a Federal debt owed to the Agency by the borrower. In such case, the Agency can use all remedies available to it to collect the debt from the borrower, including offset in accordance with part 3 of this title.

      (i) Any amounts paid by the Agency pursuant to a claim by a lender constitute a Federal debt owed to the Agency by a third-party guarantor of the guaranteed loan, to the extent of the amount of the third-party guarantee. In such case, the Agency can use all remedies available to it to collect the debt from the third-party guarantor including offset in accordance with part 3 of this title.

      (ii) The Agency may consider a compromise settlement of a debt owed to the Agency after it has processed a final report of loss and issued a 60-day due process letter. Any funds collected by the Agency will not be shared with the lender.

      (6)  In those instances where the lender made authorized protective advances, the lender can claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as well as interest resulting from such protective advances. These claims must be included in the final report of loss. The lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of protective advances as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.

      (7)  As provided in § 5001.517(e), certain reasonable liquidation expenses are allowed during the liquidation process. The lender cannot claim any liquidation expenses in excess of liquidation proceeds.

      (i) Liquidation expenses are recoverable only from liquidation proceeds. The Agency will deduct liquidation expenses from the liquidation proceeds of the collateral unless the costs have been previously determined by the lender (with Agency concurrence) to be protective advances. The lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.

      (ii) The Agency may approve legal fees as liquidation expenses provided that the fees are reasonable, require the assistance of attorneys, and cover legal issues pertaining to the liquidation that could not be properly handled by the lender, its employees or in-house counsel. Approved legal expenses are limited by the Agency to an amount not to exceed 3 percent of the current principal balance and will be shared by the lender and Agency equally. This includes those instances where the lender has incurred such expenses from a trustee conducting the liquidation of assets. Legal fees in excess of 3 percent of the current principal balance shall be borne by the lender and are not recoverable from liquidation proceeds or any loss claim by the lender.

      (iii) The lender cannot claim the guarantee fee or the other Agency fees as authorized liquidation expenses, and In-house expenses of the lender are not allowed.

      (8)  If the lender holds all or a portion of the guaranteed loan, the Agency will guarantee accrued interest in accordance with § 5001.450(c) of this part.

      (i) Accrued interest eligible for payment under the guarantee on a defaulted loan will be discontinued when the estimated loss is paid. Interest will not be paid beyond the interest termination date.

      (ii) The lender must support accrued interest by documenting how the amount was accrued, including attaching a copy of both the promissory note and ledger. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of changes in both the selected base rate and the loan rate.

      (iii) If a restructuring of a guaranteed loan includes the capitalization of interest, the guarantee will not cover the interest accrued on the capitalized interest.

      (9)  If a lender acquires title to property, any loss will be based on the collateral value at the time the lender obtains title. Alternatively, the lender can calculate the final loss settlement using the net proceeds received at the time of the ultimate disposition of the property if—

      (i) The lender has submitted to the Agency a written request to use this option within 15 calendar days of acquiring title; and

      (ii) The Agency approves the request prior to the lender submitting any request for estimated loss payment.

      (f)  The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits contained in the loan note guarantee. If the lender conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the interest termination date, provided the lender proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by the Agency. If the Agency conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered by the guarantee only to the date the Agency accepts this responsibility.

      (g)  The lender must apply any net rental or other income that it receives from the collateral to the guaranteed loan debt.

      (h)  The Agency will make loss payments after it has reviewed the complete final report of loss, all collateral has been properly liquidated and accounted for, and the Agency has determined that liquidation expenses are reasonable and within approved limits.

      (1) Any estimated loss payments made to the lender will be credited against the final loss payment on the guaranteed loan.

      (2) Once the Agency approves the report of loss and supporting documents submitted by the lender—

      (i) If the actual loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, the Agency will pay the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender.

      (ii) If the actual loss is less than the estimated loss payment, the lender must reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the promissory note rate from the date of payment of the estimated loss.

      (iii) If the Agency conducted the liquidation, it will provide an accounting to the lender and will pay the lender in accordance with the loan note guarantee.

      § 5001.522   Future recovery.

#### § § 5001.522

      After a final loss claim has been paid, the lender must use reasonable efforts to collect from any party still liable for future recovery unless the Agency notifies the lender otherwise. Any net proceeds from future recovery will be split pro rata between the lender and the Agency based on the percent of the loan guarantee even if the loan note guarantee has been terminated. Once the Agency determines a debt is Federal debt and provides notice to the lender, that Federal debt is excluded from future recovery. The lender must cease all collection efforts against the borrower and any individual or corporate guarantors upon referral of the debts by the Agency for collection in accordance with part 3 of this title. The Agency will not share with the lender any collection of Federal debt made by the Federal Government from any liable party to the guaranteed loan.

      § 5001.523   Property acquired by the lender.

#### § § 5001.523

      (a)  When a lender acquires title to the collateral and the final loss claim is not paid until final disposition, the lender must proceed as quickly as possible to develop a plan to fully protect the collateral from deterioration (weather, vandalism, etc.). Hazard insurance in an amount necessary to cover the market value of the collateral must be maintained.

      (b)  (1) Upon acquiring the collateral, the lender must prepare and submit without delay to the Agency a plan on the best method for the sale of the collateral, keeping in mind any prospective purchasers. The Agency must approve the plan in writing. If an existing approved liquidation plan addresses the disposition of acquired property, no further review is required unless modification of the plan is needed.

      (2) Whenever the conversion of collateral to cash can reasonably be expected to result in a negative net recovery amount, the lender should consider abandonment of the collateral. If the lender seeks to abandon the collateral, the lender must obtain written Agency approval before abandoning the collateral.

      (c)  Any collateral accepted by the lender must not be titled in the Agency's name in whole or in part.

      § 5001.524   Termination of loan note guarantee.

#### § § 5001.524

      Each loan note guarantee issued under this part or under one of the guaranteed loan programs identified in § 5001.1 of this part will terminate automatically when one of the events described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section occur. The lender will maintain its guaranteed loan files for at least three years after termination of the loan note guarantee.

      (a) The guaranteed loan is paid in full;

      (b) Full payment by the Agency of any loss claim or compromised settlement except for future recovery provisions; or

      (c) Written request from the lender to the Agency to terminate the guarantee, which will be effective the date the Agency receives the request provided that the lender holds all the guaranteed portion of the loan.
