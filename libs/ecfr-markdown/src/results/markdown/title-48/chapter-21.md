It is appropriate to pay such a charge when substantial risk is borne by the contractor; that is, when the balance in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund is no larger than five times annual claims.

        (2) The risk charge is determined by agreement between the contractor and OPM. The amount of risk charge shall be specified in the contract.

        (b)  (1) When the Fund balance is greater than five times annual claims, OPM and the contractor may agree that the contractor will relinquish the risk charge in favor of a profit opportunity in the form of a service charge for the contractor. The service charge so determined shall be the total service charge that may be negotiated for the contract and shall encompass any service charge (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, contribution to surpluses, etc.) that may have been negotiated by the prime contractor with any subcontractor. At no time may both a risk charge and a service charge be paid for the same portion of a policy year.

        (2) Once agreement to relinquish the risk charge is made, the agreement may not be cancelled unless OPM and the Contractor mutually agree to reinstitute payment of a risk charge; or unless the Fund balance falls below the level defined in 2115.404-70(a) and 30 days' notice of cancellation is provided; or unless the Contractor or OPM provides notice of cancellation for any reason 1 year prior to the date cancellation is sought.

        (c) Any profit prenegotiation objective (service charge) will be determined on the basis of a weighted guidelines structured approach.

        2115.404-71   Profit analysis factors.

#### § 2115.404-71

        (a) The OPM Contracting Officer will apply a weighted guidelines method when developing the prenegotiation objective (service charge) for the FEGLI Program contract. In accordance with the factors defined in FAR 15.404-4(d), OPM will apply the appropriate weights derived from the ranges specified in paragraph (b) of this section and will determine the prenegotiation objective based on the total dollar amount of the Contractor's Basic and Option C (family optional insurance) claims paid in the previous contract year.

        (1)  OPM will consider such elements as the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, effectiveness of internal controls systems in place, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress as measures of economical and efficient contract performance. This factor will be judged apart from the Contractor's  responsibility for contract compliance and will be a measure of the extent and nature of the Contractor's contribution to the FEGLI Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and conditions a zero weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEGLI Program will generally receive a plus weight; documented inattention or indifference to effective operations, a zero weight.

        (2)  OPM will evaluate the Contractor's risk annually in relation to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund and will evaluate this factor accordingly.

        (3)  OPM will consider documented evidence of successful Contractor-initiated efforts to support such Federal socioeconomic programs as drug and substance abuse deterrents and other concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.404-4(d)(1)(iii) as a factor in negotiating profit. This factor will be related to the quality of the Contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of exceptional effort or achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective support of Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a plus weight; indifference to Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a zero weight; and only deliberate failure to provide opportunities to persons and organizations that would benefit from these programs will result in a negative weight.

        (4)  This factor is generally not applicable to FEGLI Program contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be an allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor will be given a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or investment costs of direct benefit to the FEGLI Program that are not recoverable as allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be taken into account in assigning a plus weight.

        (5)  This factor is based on the Contractor's previously demonstrated ability to perform effectively and economically. In addition, consideration will be given to measures taken by the Contractor that result in productivity improvements and other cost containment accomplishments that will be of future benefit to the FEGLI Program. Examples are containment of costs associated with processing claims; success at preventing waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation of FEGLI Program assets; and success at limiting and recovering erroneous benefit payments.

        (6)  Consideration will be given to independent Contractor-initiated efforts, such as the development of a unique and enhanced customer support system, that are of demonstrated value to the FEGLI Program and for which developmental costs have not been recovered directly or indirectly through allowable or allocable administrative expenses. This factor will be used to provide additional profit opportunities based upon an assessment of the Contractor's investment and risk in developing techniques, methods, practices, etc., having viability to the Program at large. Improvements and innovations recognized and rewarded under any other profit factor cannot be considered.

        (7)  This factor is based on the Contractor's performance of transitional activities during a continuity of services period as described in the clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. These are any activities apart from the normal servicing of the contract during an active contract term. Other than for a transitional period, the weight applied to this factor for any active contract term is zero.

        (b) The weight ranges for each factor to be used in the weighted guidelines approach are set forth in the following table:

        2116.270   FEGLI Program contracts.

#### § 2116.270

        FEGLI Program contracts are fixed price with limited cost redetermination plus fixed fee. The premium paid to the Contractor is mutually agreed upon by OPM and the Contractor and is based on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs, plus the fixed service or risk charge, and is determined annually. Claims costs, including benefits and administrative expenses, in excess of premiums are paid up to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Payment for costs exceeding the amount in the Fund are the responsibility of the Contractor and reinsurers. The fee is fixed at the inception of each contract year. The fee does not vary with the actual costs but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. The fee is in the form of either a risk charge or a service charge.

        (a)  The risk charge will be determined as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 8711(d) and section 2115.404-70 of this chapter. It will consist of a negotiated amount which will reflect the risk assumed by the Contractor and the reinsurers and may be adjusted as a result of increased or decreased risk under the contract. When the applicable fee is a risk charge, no service charge will be paid for the same period of time.

        (b)  The amount of the service charge will be determined using a weighted guidelines structured approach in accordance with section 2115.404-71 of this chapter and negotiated with the Contractor at the beginning of the contract term. When the applicable fee is a service charge, no risk charge will be paid for the same period of time.

        (a) OPM shall consider taxes as a FEGLI Program cost under 2131.205-41.

        (b) For purposes of the limited cost redetermination of a FEGLI Program contract, taxes are not limited to those in effect as of the contract date, but shall include any taxes enacted, modified, or repealed, by legislative, judicial, or administrative means, during the contract year.

        (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not be construed to exempt the contractor from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by it from business conducted under the FEGLI Program if the tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.

        2129.305   State and local tax exemptions.

#### § 2129.305

        (a) FAR 29.305 is modified for the FEGLI Program by substituting paragraph (b) of this section in the place of paragraph (b) of FAR 29.305.

        (a) Costs of media messages are allowable if approved by the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) The primary objective of the message is to disseminate information on general health and fitness or encouraging healthful lifestyles;

        (2) The costs of the contractor's messages are allocated to all underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and

        (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the contractor's messages to be charged to the FEGLI Program in advance of the policy year.

        (b) Costs of media messages that inform enrollees about the FEGLI Program are allowable if approved by the contracting officer.

        (c) In those instances where contracting officer approval of the total dollar amount is not solicited in advance, it is incumbent upon the contractor to show the contracting officer, for subsequent approval, that the costs are reasonable and do not unduly burden the administrative cost to the contract.

        (d) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the contractor or subcontractor for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling its product or services are not allowable.

#### § 2131.205-3

        If the contractor or OPM determines that a FEGLI Program benefit has been paid in error for any reason, the contractor shall make a diligent effort to recover such erroneous payment from the recipient. The contracting officer shall allow an unrecovered erroneous payment to be charged to the contract provided the contractor demonstrates that the recovery of the erroneous payment was attempted in accordance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) and that either a diligent effort was made to recover the erroneous overpayment or it would not be cost effective to recover the erroneous overpayment. The contractor's compliance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) will be deemed to be a diligent effort to recover the erroneous overpayment.

        2131.205-6   Compensation for personal services.

        2131.205-41   Taxes.

#### § 2131.205-41

        (a) FAR 31.205-41, as modified in paragraphs (b) through (e), is applicable to contracts in the FEGLI Program.

        (b) As long as 5 U.S.C. 8714(c) or other Federal law prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or other monetary payments on FEGLI Program premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any other political subdivision or governmental authority of those entities, payment of such preempted tax is an unallowable expense under FAR 31.205-41(b)(3).

        (c) Paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 31.205-41 is not applicable to the FEGLI Program.

        (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, the portion of the contractor's income or excess profits taxes allocated to the FEGLI Program, except those allocated to the risk charge or the service charge, are allowable costs under the FEGLI Program, including any income or excess profit taxes that arise from the operation of this paragraph. Income or excess profits taxes allocated to the risk charge or the service charge are not allowable costs.

        (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, an amount equal to the “DAC Tax” is an allowable tax expense under FAR 31.205-41. “DAC Tax” means an amount equal to: (1) the amount of the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the FEGLI Program, less (2) the amount of the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the FEGLI Program computed without regard to the operation of 26 U.S.C. 848, which requires that certain policy acquisition expenses be capitalized over a 60- or 120-month period, plus (3) the amount of the increase, if any, in the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax that results from the operation of this section 2131.205-41(e).

        2131.205-43   Trade, business, technical and professional activity costs.

#### § 2131.205-43

        (a) FEGLI Program contractors shall seek the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional activities when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEGLI Program will exceed $2,500 annually and the contractor allocates more than 50 percent of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEGLI Program.

        (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is required, the contractor must demonstrate conclusively that membership in such an organization and participation in its activities extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable relationship to providing services to FEGLI Program insureds, and that the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.

        2131.205-70   Major subcontractor service charge.

#### § 2131.205-70

        In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, administration of claims and payment of benefits and any other subcontract for which prior approval is necessary, when costs are determined on the basis of actual costs incurred, any amount that exceeds the allowable cost of a major subcontract (whether entitled service charge, incentive fee, profit, fee, surplus, or any other title) is not allowable under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the risk charge or service charge negotiated between OPM and the contractor.

        2131.205-71   Reinsurer administrative expense costs.

#### § 2131.205-71

        A charge of $500 per policy year per reinsurer of the FEGLI Program as set forth in the contract is an allowable cost when documented through an internal accounting entry of the contractor and actually paid. This amount is deemed to be sufficient to reimburse reinsurers for the minor administrative expenses incurred in reinsuring the FEGLI Program.

        2132.170   Recurring premium payments to Contractors.

#### § 2132.170

        (a) OPM will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. OPM and the Contractor will concur on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs plus the fixed service or risk charge for the forthcoming contract year, as specified in the contract. The annual premium to the Contractor, based on this estimate, will be credited to the Contractor's LOC account in 12 equal monthly installments due on the first business day of each month and available for drawdown. OPM will credit the Contractor's LOC account for the December payment no later than the last business day of each calendar year. Following the close of the contract year, a reconciliation of premiums, benefits, and other costs will be performed as a limited cost redetermination. In addition, interest distribution payments will be made available for Contractor drawdown from the LOC account. The Contractor will use the LOC account in accordance with guidelines issued by OPM.

        (b) Withdrawals from the LOC account for benefit costs of $5,000 or more will be made on a claims-paid basis. Withdrawals from the LOC account for benefit costs of less than $5,000 and other FEGLI Program disbursements will be made on a checks-presented basis. Under a checks-presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is delayed until the checks issued for FEGLI Program disbursements are presented to the Contractor's bank for payment.

        (c) Nothing in this chapter will affect the ability of the Contractor to hold the special contingency reserve established and maintained in accordance with the terms of 5 U.S.C. 8712.

The statutory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 8707 and 8708 authorize joint enrollee and Government contributions to the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Because the Fund is comprised of contributions by enrollees as well as the Government, contractors may not offset debts to the Fund by a tax credit that is solely a Government obligation.

#### § 2137.102

        (a) The services under this contract are of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without interruption in the event the contract is terminated, unless the termination occurs as a result of OPM's failure to pay premiums on a timely basis.

        (b) The Contractor will be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in and phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed-upon period after contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out operations). The Contractor also will receive a risk or service charge for the full period after contract termination during which services are continued, not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service charge for the final contract year. In addition, OPM will pay the Contractor an incentive amount, not to exceed the pro rata risk or service charge for the continuity of services period (LIFAR 2152.237-70), based on exceptional performance during the transition period to a new Contractor. The Contracting Officer will use the weighted guidelines method described in 2115.404-71 of this chapter in determining the incentive amount. The amount of the risk or service charge will be based upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of customer service complaints, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, insured individuals, beneficiaries, and Congress.

        (a) This part prescribes policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under the FEGLI Program contract conform to the contract's quality requirements.

        (b) OPM will make an initial evaluation of the Contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by 2146.270 of this chapter and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart. After the initial review, subsequent periodic reviews may be limited to changes in the Contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does not diminish the Contractor's obligation to apply the full internal control system.

        2146.270   FEGLI Program quality assurance requirements.

#### § 2146.270

        (a) The contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance program specifying procedures for assuring contract quality, as directed by the contracting officer. At a minimum, the program should include procedures to address:

        (1) Accuracy of payments and recovery of overpayments;

        (2) Timeliness of payments to beneficiaries;

        (3) Quality of services and responsiveness to beneficiaries;

        (4) Quality of service and responsiveness to OPM; and

        (5) Detection and recovery of fraudulent claims.

        (b) The Contractor must prepare overpayment recovery guidelines to include a system of internal controls.

        (c) The contracting officer may order the correction of a deficiency or a modification in the contractor's services and/or quality assurance program. The contractor shall take the necessary action promptly to implement the contracting officer's order. If the contracting officer orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year. However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken into consideration.

      2149.002   Applicability.

#### § 2149.002

      (a)  (1) Termination of FEGLI Program contracts is controlled by 5 U.S.C. 8709(c) and this chapter. The procedures for termination of FEGLI Program contracts are contained in FAR part 49. For the purpose of this part, terminate means to discontinue as used in 5 U.S.C. 8709(c).

      (2) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated by OPM at any time for default by the Contractor in accordance with the provisions of FAR part 49 and FAR 52.249-8. A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated by the Contractor at the end of the grace period, after default for nonpayment by OPM. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Contractor will allow OPM an additional 5 days after the end of the grace period to make payment if the failure to make payment was inadvertent and/or due to circumstances beyond the Government's control.

      (3) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated for convenience of the Government 60 days after the Contractor's receipt of OPM's written notice to terminate.

      (4) The Contractor may terminate its contract with OPM at the end of any contract year when notice of intent to terminate is given to OPM in writing at least 60 days prior to the end of the contract year (i.e., no later than July 31).

      (b)  The services under this contract are of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without interruption in the event the contract is terminated for the Contractor's default or OPM's convenience. Consequently, the contract termination procedures contained in this paragraph must be used in conjunction with section 2137.102 of this chapter, section 2137.110 of this chapter, and the provisions of the “Continuity of Services” clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. The Contractor is not required to continue performance subsequent to OPM's default for failure to pay premiums in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 2152.249-70(b) of this chapter.

      (c)  The procedures for settlement of contracts after they are terminated are those contained in FAR part 49.
