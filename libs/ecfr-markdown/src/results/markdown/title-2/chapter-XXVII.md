    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 2700.765   How may I appeal my suspension?

#### § § 2700.765

      (a) If the SBA suspending official issues a decision under § 180.755 to continue your suspension after you present information in opposition to that suspension under § 180.720, you may ask for review of the suspending official's decision in two ways:

      (1) You may ask the suspending official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or

      (2) You may request that the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) review the suspending official's decision to continue your suspension within 30 days of your receipt of the suspending official's decision under § 180.755 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, OHA may reverse the suspending official's decision only where OHA finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where OHA finds that the suspending official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the suspending official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the suspending official on reconsideration. The procedures governing OHA appeals are set forth in 13 CFR part 134.

      (b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

      (c) OHA, in its discretion, may stay the suspension pending review of the suspending official's decision.

      (d) The SBA suspending official and OHA must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.

    Subpart H—Debarment

      § 2700.890   How may I appeal my debarment?

#### § § 2700.890

      (a) If the SBA debarring official issues a decision under § 180.870 to debar you after you present information in opposition to a proposed debarment under § 180.815, you may ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:

      (1) You may ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or

      (2) You may request that the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) review the debarring official's decision to debar you within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, OHA may reverse the debarring official's decision only where OHA finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where OHA finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration. The procedures governing OHA appeals are set forth in 13 CFR part 134.

      (b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

      (c) OHA, in its discretion, may stay the debarment pending review of the debarring official's decision.

      (d) The SBA debarring official and OHA must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.

    Subpart J [Reserved]

    § 2700.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 2700.10

    This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the SBA policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for SBA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-355 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note).

    § 2700.20   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 2700.20

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970);

    (b) Respondent in an SBA suspension or debarment action;

    (c) SBA debarment or suspension official; or

    (d) SBA grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

    § 2700.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 2700.30

    The SBA policies and procedures you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 of this part (i.e., § 2700.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, SBA policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

    (2) The amount of funding that must be devoted to conducting program activities in order for a project to result in meaningful outcomes; and

    (3) The amount of project funds that will remain available for conducting program activities after a negotiated rate is applied.

    (b) After conducting the analysis required in paragraph (a) above, the head of each SBA grant program office will determine in writing whether there is sufficient justification to deviate from a negotiated indirect cost rate.
