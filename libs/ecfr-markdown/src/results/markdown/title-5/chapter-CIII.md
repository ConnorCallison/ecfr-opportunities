#### § § 10300.101

    (a)  In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), other than special government employees as defined in 5 CFR 2635.102(l), and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR part 2635 (Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Standards).

    (b)  In addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, FMCS employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by the FMCS in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). FMCS employees are also subject to the regulations concerning executive branch financial disclosures contained in 5 CFR part 2634, the regulations concerning executive branch financial interests contained in 5 CFR part 2640, regulations concerning post-employment restrictions contained in 5 CFR part 2641, and the regulations concerning executive branch employee responsibilities and conduct contained in 5 CFR part 735. Employees should contact an FMCS ethics official if they have questions about any provision of this regulation or other ethics-related matters.

    § 10300.102   Definitions.

#### § § 10300.102

    For purposes of this part:

    means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship, compensated or uncompensated, involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to:

    (1) Personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, professor, speaker, or writer.

    (2) Active participation, including voluntary participation as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1)(v), with a prohibited source.

    (3) It does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such activities are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses; such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice; or the organization's activities are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E).

    § 10300.103   Prior approval for outside employment and outside activities.

#### § § 10300.103

    (a)  Before engaging in any outside employment or outside activity, as it is defined in § 10300.102, an employee of the FMCS, other than a special government employee, must obtain written approval.

    (b)  The employee must first obtain written approval from the employee's immediate supervisor and then the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO). If the employee does not obtain written approval from the employee's immediate supervisor, the employee may request review by the DAEO. Decisions by the DAEO are final and non-appealable.

    (c)  Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or outside activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.

    (d)  Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or outside activity or in the employee's official position with the FMCS, the employee must, within 7 calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval. If there are no significant changes in the nature or scope of the outside employment or outside activity or in the employee's official position with the FMCS, the employee does not need to reapply after the FMCS' initial approval.

    (e)  The DAEO may issue instructions or manual issuances governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment or outside activities. The instructions or manual issuances may exempt categories of employment and activities from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment or activity within those categories of employment or activities would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The DAEO may include in these instructions or issuances examples of outside employment and activities that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.
