Other laws, executive orders, and regulations provide related direction. NEPA establishes and AFRH adopts as policy that as a Federal agency, AFRH will: Use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of national policy, to improve and coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to the end that the Nation may:\n",
              "(1) Fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;\n",
              "(2) Assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;\n",
              "(3) Attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences;\n",

              "(5) Achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities; and\n",
              "(6) Enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.\n",
              "(b) As an important means of carrying out this policy, AFRH will analyze and consider the impacts of its proposed actions (activities, programs, projects, legislation) and any reasonable alternatives on the environment, and on the relationship of people with the environment. This analysis is to be undertaken early in planning any such action, as an aid to deciding whether the action will go forward, and if so how. Consideration must be given to reasonable alternative means of achieving the purpose and need for the proposed action, and to the alternative of not taking the proposed action. The analysis is to be completed, and used to inform the decision maker and make the public aware of the action's potential impacts, before the decision is made about whether and how to proceed with the action. Relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses regarding the proposal will accompany the proposal and be presented to the AFRH decision maker for their consideration.\n",
