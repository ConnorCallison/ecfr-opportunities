      Subpart 3001.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance

        3001.101   Purpose.

#### § 3001.101

        The Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures, which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

        3001.102   Statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System.

#### § 3001.102

        (d) The FAR and this supplement are to be interpreted permissively, if consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, policy, and sound professional judgment.

        3001.103   Authority.

#### § 3001.103

        The HSAR is issued by DHS's Chief Procurement Officer, who is the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), see 41 U.S.C. 1702 and DHS Delegation Number 0702, under authority of 5 U.S.C. 301-302, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, Pub. L. No. 93-400, 88 Stat. 796 (1974), including sections 22 and 25, 41 U.S.C. 1707, 1302 and 1303, and (FAR) 48 CFR part 1, subpart 1.3.

> [77 FR 50632, Aug. 22, 2012]

        3001.104   Applicability.

#### § 3001.104

        (a) The following order of precedence applies to resolve any acquisition regulation or procedural inconsistency found within HSAR or the Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM):

        (1) Statute;

        (2) FAR or other applicable regulation or Executive Order;

        (3) HSAR;

        (4) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directives; and

        (5) HSAM.

        (b) The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exception to this regulation is authorized by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA) (section 101(a) of Public Law 107-71, as implemented at section 114(o) of title 49) for contracts awarded by TSA pursuant to this ATSA authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, Public Law 110-161, Division E, Title V, section 568 eliminates ATSA section 114(o) effective June 23, 2008. Accordingly, TSA acquisitions initiated after June 22, 2008 are subject to 48 CFR Chapters 1 and 30.

        (c) Contracts involving Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) must contain suitable dispute provisions and may provide for appellate dispute jurisdiction in the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA). However, the contract must not attempt to confer court jurisdiction that does not otherwise exist.

        (d) The FAR and HSAR may be followed, where feasible, for:

        (1) No-cost contracts;

        (2) Concession contracts; and

        (3) Contracts on behalf of NAFIs entered into by appropriated fund contracting officers.

        3001.301   Policy.

#### § 3001.301

        (a)(1) The HSAR is issued for Departmental guidance according to the policy cited in (FAR) 48 CFR 1.301. The HSAR establishes uniform Department of Homeland Security policies and procedures for all acquisition activities within the Department of Homeland Security. Component supplemental acquisition regulations to be inserted in the HSAR as a HSAR supplement regulation must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) before the CPO authorizes and submits the proposed content for publication in the  under (FAR) 48 CFR part 1, subparts 1.3 and 1.5.

        (2)(i) The CPO is authorized to issue internal agency guidance at any organizational level. Department-wide procedures are contained in the HSAM. The HCA may implement internal procedures or supplement the FAR, HSAR, or HSAM as provided in HSAM 3001.3. The HCA may issue procedures or delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. Component procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by the HSAM, unless otherwise specified.

        (ii) Individuals granted authority in the HSAR may delegate that authority, unless the FAR or HSAR specifically state that the authority is not delegable.

        (b) The Under Secretary of Management established procedures through Management Directive (MD) 0490.1, entitled  to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are published for comment in the  in conformance with FAR procedures at (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 1.5.

        (1)  Succinctly state the problem(s) created by current HSAR requirements or processes and describe the factual or legal reasons for requesting a regulatory change.

        (2)  Identify the recommended change by using the current language and lining through the words to be deleted and inserting proposed language in brackets. If the change is extensive, deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines connecting the corners.

        (3)  Explain why the change is necessary and how the change will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative impact on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any other helpful information and documents such as statutes, legal decisions, regulations, reports, etc.

        (4)  Provide a point of contact for answering questions regarding the recommendation, along with a telephone number, e-mail or other method of reaching the contact.

        (b) The HSAR is maintained by the CPO through the HSAR/HSAM change process (i.e., input from various Components including representatives specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies and procedures).

        (1) Homeland Security Acquisition Circular (HSAC). HSAC (see (HSAR) 48 Chapter 3001.301-72) will be used to amend (HSAR) 48 Chapter 30.

        (2) HSAR Notices will be issued (with a specified expiration date) when interim guidance is necessary under any of the following circumstances:

        (i) To promulgate, as rapidly as possible, selected material in a general or narrative manner, in advance of a HSAC issuance;

        (ii) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or

        (iii) To issue guidance that is expected to be effective for a period of 1 year or less.

> [68 FR 67871, Dec. 4, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 25767, May 2, 2006; 71 FR 48800, Aug. 22, 2006; 77 FR 50632, Aug. 22, 2012]

#### § 3001.301-71

        Unless otherwise stated:

        (a) HSAR changes apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the change;

        (b) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, amend solicitations issued before the effective date to include HSAR changes, provided award of the resulting contract(s) will occur on or after the effective date of the change; and

        (c) When required by law, contracting officers must modify existing contracts to include HSAR changes. Otherwise, and where feasible, contracting officers should consider using the Changes clause or other suitable authority, to modify existing contracts to include HSAR changes.

> [71 FR 25767, May 2, 2006, as amended at 77 FR 50632, Aug. 22, 2012]

        3001.301-72   HSAC or HSAR Notice numbering.

#### § 3001.301-72

        HSACs and HSAR Notices will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis beginning with number “01” prefixed by the last two digits of the fiscal year (e.g., HSAR Notices 03-01 and 03-02 indicate the first two HSAR Notices issued in fiscal year 2003).

        3001.303   Publication and codification.

#### § 3001.303

        (a) The HSAR is issued as chapter 30 of Title 48 of the CFR.

        (1) The FAR numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2 apply to the HSAR.

        (2) Coverage within HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30 is identified by the prefix “30” followed by the complete FAR cite which may extend downward to the subparagraph level (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.101).

        (3) Coverage in HSAR chapter 30 that supplements the FAR will use part, subpart, section, and subsection numbers ending in “70” through “89”. A series of numbers beginning with “70” is used for provisions and clauses (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.301-70).

        (4) Coverage in HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30, other than that identified with a “70” or higher number, which implements the FAR uses the identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being implemented which may extend downward to the subparagraph level. Subparagraph numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be shown by the specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3003.301 contains subparagraphs (a) and (b) because only these subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being supplemented by (HSAR) 48 CFR chapter 30).

        (5)  Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR or HSAR shall be identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of “90” and up (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard's acronym is “USCG”; an USCG-unique clause pertaining to “Inspection and/or Acceptance” would be designated “USCG 3052.246-90”).

        (6) References and citations. Cross references to the FAR in the HSAR will be cited by “FAR” followed by the FAR numbered cite, and cross reference to the HSAM in the HSAR will be cited by “HSAM” followed by the HSAM numbered cite.

        (7) Department/agency and Component supplements must parallel the FAR and HSAR numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

        3001.304   Agency control and compliance procedures.

#### § 3001.304

        (a) The HSAR is under the direct oversight and control of the DHS, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), which is responsible for evaluation, review, and issuance of all Department-wide acquisition regulations and guidance in accordance with DHS regulatory clearance procedures, as applicable. Each HCA may supplement the HSAR with internal Component issued guidance that does not go beyond internal operating procedures and does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. Supplementation should be kept to a minimum. Any Component that seeks a component-specific regulation or that intends to use a solicitation provision or a contract clause on a repetitive basis must prepare and coordinate a draft rule with Component legal counsel and obtain HCA approval, which is non delegable. The HCA must forward the draft rule to the CPO for concurrence prior to further action in accordance with DHS regulatory clearance procedures. If approved, the CPO or designee, will sign the Component-specific regulation and it will be integrated into the HSAR.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) The CPO is responsible for evaluating all proposed regulatory coverage in the HSAR to determine if the substance could apply to other agencies and to make recommendation for inclusion in the FAR.

        (2) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (title XXII, subtitle B of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 as amended through Pub. L. 116-283), PCII's implementing regulations (6 CFR part 29), the PCII Program Procedures Manual, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security, the PCII Program Manager, or a PCII Program Manager Designee;

        (3) Sensitive Security Information (SSI) as defined in 49 CFR part 1520, “Protection of Sensitive Security Information,” as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or designee), including Department of Homeland Security MD 11056.1, “Sensitive Security Information (SSI)” and, within the Transportation Security Administration, TSA MD 2810.1, “SSI Program”;

        (4) Homeland Security Agreement Information means information the Department of Homeland Security receives pursuant to an agreement with State, local, Tribal, territorial, or private sector partners that is required to be protected by that agreement. The Department receives this information in furtherance of the missions of the Department, including, but not limited to, support of the Fusion Center Initiative and activities for cyber information sharing consistent with the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015;

        (5) Homeland Security Enforcement Information means unclassified information of a sensitive nature lawfully created, possessed, or transmitted by the Department of Homeland Security in furtherance of its immigration, customs, and other civil and criminal enforcement missions, the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact the mission of the Department;

        (7) Information Systems Vulnerability Information (ISVI) means:

        (i) Department of Homeland Security information technology (IT) systems data revealing infrastructure used for servers, desktops, and networks; applications name, version, and release; switching, router, and gateway information; interconnections and access methods; and mission or business use/need. Examples of ISVI are systems inventories and enterprise architecture models. Information pertaining to national security systems and eligible for classification under Executive Order 13526 will be classified as appropriate; and/or

        (ii) Information regarding developing or current technology, the release of which could hinder the objectives of the Department, compromise a technological advantage or countermeasure, cause a denial of service, or provide an adversary with sufficient information to clone, counterfeit, or circumvent a process or system;

        (10) Physical Security Information means reviews or reports illustrating or disclosing facility infrastructure or security vulnerabilities related to the protection of Federal buildings, grounds, or property. For example, threat assessments, system security plans, contingency plans, risk management plans, business impact analysis studies, and certification and accreditation documentation;

        (11) Privacy Information includes both Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.

        (i) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.

        (ii) Multiple pieces of information may present an increased risk of harm to the individual when combined, posing an increased risk of harm to the individual. SPII may also consist of any grouping of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:

        (A) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits);

        (B) Date of birth (month, day, and year);

        (C) Citizenship or immigration status;

        (D) Ethnic or religious affiliation;

        (E) Sexual orientation;

        (F) Criminal history;

        (G) Medical information; and

        (2) Constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

        3004.470-3   Policy.

#### § 3004.470-3

        (a) DHS requires that CUI be safeguarded when it resides on DHS-owned and operated information systems, DHS-owned and contractor-operated information systems, contractor-owned and/or operated information systems operating on behalf of the Department, and any situation where contractor and/or subcontractor employees may have access to CUI because of their relationship with DHS. There are several Department policies and procedures (accessible at ) that also address the safeguarding of CUI. Compliance with these policies and procedures, as amended, is required.

        (b) DHS requires contractor employees that require recurring access to government facilities or access to CUI to complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine fitness. Department policies and procedures that address contractor employee fitness are contained in Instruction Handbook Number 121-01-007,  Compliance with these policies and procedures, as amended, is required.

For acquisitions in which contractor and/or subcontractor employees will not have access to government information resources, but the department has determined contractor and/or subcontractor employee access to CUI or government facilities must be limited to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its Alternate II. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates shall be used unless contractor and/or subcontractor employees will require recurring access to government facilities or access to CUI. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates should ordinarily be used in contracts with educational institutions.

        (b)(1) Contracting officers shall insert the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.204-72,  in solicitations and contracts where:

        3009.171-4   Determination of ownership, control, or operation.

#### § 3009.171-4

        (a) Whether an individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern is determined on the specific facts of the case, with reference to the factors identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. Prior to contract award, such individual must provide any additional documentation to the contracting officer upon the contracting officer's request for the agency's use in determining ownership, control, or operation. The refusal to provide or to timely provide such documentation may serve as grounds for the contracting officer to refuse making contract award to the business concern.

        (b) Any financial, voting, operational, or employment interest in the business concern of a spouse, child, or other family member of, or person sharing a household with, the individual will be imputed to the individual in determining whether and the extent to which the individual owns, controls, or operates the business concern.

        (c) An individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern by fulfilling or holding the following types of roles or interests with respect to the business concern:

        (1) Director or officer, including incumbents of boards and offices that perform duties ordinarily performed by a chairman or member of a board of directors, a secretary, treasurer, president, a vice president, or other chief official of a business concern, including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief contracting official.

        (2) Officials of comparable function and status to those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection as exist in partnerships of all kind and other business organizations, including sole proprietorships.

        (3) A general partner in a general or limited partnership.

        (4) An individual with a limited partnership interest of 25% or more.

        (5) An individual that has the:

        (i) Power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25% or more interest in any class of voting stock of the business concern;

        (ii) Ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of the business concern's directors or trustees; or

        (iii) Ability to exercise a controlling influence over the business concern's management, policies, or decision making.

        (d) Generally, the existence of one or more of the roles or interests set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection, including roles or interests attributed to the individual, will be sufficient to determine that the individual owns, controls or operates the business concern. However, specific facts of the case may warrant a different determination by the contracting officer, where, for example, an indicator in paragraph (c) of this subsection, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, suggests that the individual lacks sufficient authority or autonomy to exert authority customarily associated with ownership or control or the assertion of operational prerogatives (e.g. the individual is one of twenty on a board of directors, plays no other role, and holds no other interest). Conversely, ownership, control, or the ability to operate the business concern, if it exists in fact, can be reflected by other roles or interests.

        (2) Bribery, graft, or a conflict of interest;

        (3) Threatened or actual harm to a government official or family member;

        (4) Threatened or actual harm to government property;

        (5) A crime of violence;

#### § 3009.171-6

        (a) In accordance with FAR Subpart 9.4 (48 CFR subpart 9.4), a contracting officer may not award a contract for FPS guard services to any business concern that is suspended, debarred or proposed for debarment unless the agency head determines that there is a compelling reason for such action.

        (c) The contracting officer shall not award an FPS guard services contract to any business concern that is owned, controlled or operated by an individual convicted of a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5 except as provided in under (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-7.

        (d) In considering an award request under (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-7, the contracting officer may not review the fact of the conviction itself, but may consider any information provided by the individual or business concern, and any information known to the contracting officer. Factors that the contracting officer may consider include, but are not limited to:

        (1) The age of the conviction.

        3009.171-7   Contract award approval procedures for contractors with felony convictions.

#### § 3009.171-7

        (a) The HCA has sole discretion to approve a request to permit award of a contract for FPS guard services to a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an individual convicted of a felony, for any reason permitted by this regulation. This authority is not delegable.

        (b) A business concern owned, operated or controlled by an individual convicted of any felony (including a serious felony) may submit an award request to the contracting officer. The basis for such request shall be that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation; that such individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer poses the contract risk the Act and this regulation were designed to guard against. The business concern shall bear the burden of proof for award requests.

        (c) A copy of the award approval request with supporting documentation or a previously approved award request shall be attached with the bid or proposal.

        (d) An award approval request shall contain the basis for the request, including, at a minimum, the following information:

        (1) Name and date of birth of individual convicted of a felony;

        (2) A full description of which roles or interests indicate that the individual owns, controls, or operates, or may own control or operate the business concern;

        (3) Date sentenced;

        (4) Statute/Charge;

        (5) Docket/Case Number;

        (9) Whether the individual has made full restitution for the felony; and

        (10) Whether the individual has accepted responsibility for past misconduct resulting in the felony conviction.

        (e) If the contracting officer is unable to affirmatively determine that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5; that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and would be consistent with the mission of FPS, then the contracting officer shall deny the award approval request and not forward such request to the HCA.

        (f) For a felony that meets any of the following conditions, the contracting officer shall refer the award request, with a copy of the contracting officer's determination, to the HCA with a recommendation for approval:

        (1) The subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation;

        (2) The convicted individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or

        (3) The commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of the FPS.

        (g) The HCA shall make a final written decision on the award approval request following referral and after any necessary additional inquiry.

        (b) Unless inappropriate, the clauses in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-90 through (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-93 and (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-95 through (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-99 should be included and (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-94 may be included in negotiated solicitations and contracts to be performed outside the United States. The contracting officer may, in whole or in part (such as after incidents), increase the dollar amounts in the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-95(b)(6) and (c)(1) consistent with contract size, inflation, and other circumstances.

        (c) The clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-100, Guarantee, shall be used where general guarantee provisions are deemed desirable by the contracting officer.

        (1) When inspection and acceptance tests will afford full protection to the Government in ascertaining conformance to specifications and the absence of defects and deficiencies, no guarantee clause for that purpose shall be included in the contract.

        (2) The customary guarantee period, to be inserted in the first sentence of the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-100, Guarantee, is 60 days. However, in certain instances, the contracting officer may desire to include a clause in a contract for a guarantee period of more than 60 days. In such instances:

        (i) Where, after full inquiry, it has been determined that such longer guarantee period will not involve increased costs, a longer guarantee period may be substituted by the contracting officer for the usual 60 days; or

        (ii) Where the full inquiry discloses that such longer guarantee period will involve, or is reasonably expected to involve, increased costs, such facts and the reasons for the need for such longer period shall be set forth in letter form to the COCO, requesting approval for use of guarantee period in excess of 60 days. Upon approval, the longer period may be inserted by the contracting officer in the first sentence of the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.217-100, Guarantee.

It is the policy of DHS to admit non-employee labor union representatives of contractor employees to DHS installations to visit work sites and transact labor union business with contractors, their employees, and union stewards pursuant to existing union collective bargaining agreements.

However, if there have been incidents of vandalism, illegal work stoppages, or interference with work, the non-employee labor union representatives may be subject to access limitations. Non-employee labor union representatives will not be permitted to conduct meetings, collect union dues, or make speeches concerning union matters while visiting a work site during working hours.

        (b) Whenever a non-employee labor union representative is denied entry to a work site, the person denying entry shall make a written report to the DHS labor advisor and Component labor advisor, if any, within two working days after the request for entry is denied. The report shall include the reason(s) for the denial, the name of the representative denied entry, the union affiliation and number, and the name and title of the person that denied the entry.

#### § 3025.7002-2

        Acquisitions in the following categories are not subject to the restrictions in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1:

        (a) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (b) Acquisition of items not directly related to national security interests of the United States.

        (c) Acquisitions of any of the items otherwise covered by (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1, if the Chief Procurement Officer determines that the item grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States cannot be acquired as and when needed in a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity at United States market prices. When this exception is used—

        (1) Only the DHS Chief Procurement Officer is authorized to make the domestic nonavailability determination.

        (2) The DHS Component, not later than 7 days after the award of the contract, must post a notification that the exception has been applied on the Government-wide point of entry, which may be combined with any synopsis of award.

        (3) The supporting documentation for the CPO determination prepared by the DHS Component(s) shall include—

        (i) An analysis of alternatives that would not require a domestic nonavailability determination; and

        (ii) A written justification by the requiring activity, with specificity, why such alternatives are unacceptable.

        (f) Acquisitions by vessels in foreign waters.

        3025.7002-3   Specific application of trade agreements.

#### § 3025.7002-3

        (a) For covered items entitled to non-discriminatory treatment under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO GPA), or any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) listed in (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 25.4, this subpart is applied as follows—

        (1) For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by any component other than Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in which any covered items will be procured with a value that is both above the simplified acquisition threshold, and below the applicable trade agreement threshold in (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402, apply (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1. Section 3025.7002-2(h) will exclude eligible products of designated countries with FTA thresholds beneath the simplified acquisition threshold from coverage of section 604.

        (2) For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by any component other than Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in which any covered items will be procured with a value exceeding $194,000 (or the superseding threshold upon updating of (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402), (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1 does not apply if the items are eligible products per FAR 48 CFR subpart 25.4; follow (FAR) 48 CFR part 25 instead.

        (3) For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by TSA in which any covered items will be procured with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002 applies to all covered items except those from Mexico, Canada or Chile because TSA is listed as a covered governmental entity in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement but TSA is excluded from all other trade agreements.

        (b) For covered items from a country that is not entitled to non-discriminatory treatment under the WTO GPA, or any FTA listed in (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 25.4, apply the restrictions of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002 to all solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold in place of the Buy America Act policies at (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 25.1.

        3025.7003   Contract clauses.

#### § 3025.7003

        Unless an exception under (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-2(a), (b), (e) or (f) applies, insert the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.225-70, Requirement for Use of Certain Domestic Commodities, in solicitations, exercising of an option, contract modifications that add new items (or which make a cardinal change) and contracts with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold when procuring any item covered under (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1(a) or (b).

#### § 3028.306

        3028.306-90   Contracts for lease of aircraft (USCG).

#### § 3028.306-90

        (a) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert the clauses at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-91 through 3052.228-93, unless otherwise indicated by the specific instructions for their use, in any contract for the lease of aircraft (including aircraft used in out-service flight training).

        (b) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-91, Loss of or Damage to Leased Aircraft, in any contract for the lease of aircraft, except in the following circumstances:

        (1) When the hourly rental rate does not exceed $250 and the total rental cost for any single transaction is not in excess of $2,500:

        (2) When the cost of hull insurance does not exceed 10 percent of the contract rate; or

        (3) When the lessor's insurer does not grant a credit for uninsured hours, thereby preventing the lessor from granting the same to the Government.

        (c) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-92, Fair Market Value of Aircraft, when fair market value of the aircraft can be determined.

        (d) 49 U.S.C. 44112, as amended, provides that no lessor of an aircraft under a  lease of 30 days or more shall be liable by reason of his interest as lessor or title-holder of the aircraft for any injury to or death of persons, or damage to or loss of property, unless such aircraft is in the actual possession or control of such person at the time of such injury, death, damage or loss. On short-term or intermittent-use leases, however, the owner may be liable for damage caused by operation of the aircraft. It is usual for the aircraft owner to retain insurance covering this liability during the term of such lease. Such insurance can, often for little or no increase in premium, be made to cover the Government's exposure to liability as well. In order to take advantage of this coverage, the Risks and Indemnities clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-93 prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be used.

        (1) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-93, Risk and Indemnities, in any contract for out-service flight training or for the lease of aircraft when the Government will have exclusive use of the aircraft for a period of less than thirty days.

        (2) For the U.S. Coast Guard, any contract for out-service flight training shall include a clause in the contract schedule stating substantially that the contractor's personnel shall at all times during the course of the training be in command of the aircraft and that at no time shall other personnel be permitted to take command of the aircraft.

        (i) Coordinate benefits, taxes and maintenance of records with the appropriate office(s).

        (a) As the objectives and circumstances vary considerably among major systems acquisition programs, contracting officers shall appropriately tailor the warranty on a case-by-case basis, including remedies, exclusions, limitations and durations, provided the tailoring is consistent with the specific requirements of this subpart and (FAR) 48 CFR 46.706.

        (b) Contracting officers of major systems acquisitions may exclude from the terms of the warranty certain defects for specified supplies (exclusions) and may limit the contractor's liability under the terms of the warranty (limitations), as appropriate, if necessary to derive a cost-effective warranty in light of the technical risk, contractor financial risk, or other program uncertainties.

        (c) Contracting officers are encouraged to structure a broader and more comprehensive warranty where such is advantageous. Likewise, the contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate (e.g., where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the system).

        (d) Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage, or injury to third parties.

        3046.791-3   Warranties on Government-furnished property (USCG).

#### § 3046.791-3

        A contractor for a major systems acquisition shall not be required to provide the warranties specified in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.790-1 on any property furnished to that contractor by the Government except for:

        (a) Defects in installation; and

        (b) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates a warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property.

        3046.792   Cost benefit analysis (USCG).

#### § 3046.792

        If a specific warranty is considered not to be cost beneficial by the contracting officer, a waiver request shall be initiated in accordance with guidance at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.793.

        3046.793   Waiver and notification procedures (USCG).

#### § 3046.793

        (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, without delegation, may waive the requirement for a warranty for USCG major system acquisitions when the waiver is in the interest of national defense or if the warranty obtained would not be cost beneficial. A waiver may be granted provided that the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives are notified, in writing, of the Secretary's intention to waive the warranty requirements and the reasons supporting such a determination prior to granting the waiver. The request for Secretarial waiver shall include, as a minimum:

        (1) A brief description of the major system and its stage of production (e.g., the number of units delivered and anticipated to be delivered during the life of the program);

        (2) The specific waiver requested, the duration of the waiver if it is to involve more than one contract, and the rationale for the waiver; and

        (3) All documentation supporting the request for waiver, such as a cost-benefit analysis.

        (b) The waiver request shall be forwarded to the Secretary, via the CPO. The USCG shall maintain a written record of each waiver granted and the Congressional notification and report made, together with supporting documentation.
