The Department was created in recognition of the paramount interest in safeguarding the American people, without compromising statutorily protected employee rights. For this reason Congress stressed that personnel systems established by the Department and OPM must be flexible and contemporary, enabling the Department to rapidly respond to threats to our Nation. The labor-management relations regulations in this subpart are designed to meet these compelling concerns and must be interpreted with the Department's mission foremost in mind. The regulations also recognize the rights of DHS employees to organize and bargain collectively, subject to any exclusion from coverage or limitation on negotiability established by law, including these regulations, applicable Executive orders, and any other legal authority. \n\n\n"

An employee will be deemed to have exercised his or her option under this section when the employee timely files an appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or a grievance in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever occurs first.\n",

Once an employee raises a performance rating issue in an appeal under subpart G of this part, any pending grievance or arbitration will be dismissed with prejudice.\n",
                  "(2) An arbitrator may cancel a performance rating upon a finding that management applied the employee's established performance expectations in violation of applicable law, Department rule or regulation, or provision of collective bargaining agreement in a manner prejudicial to the grievant. An arbitrator who has properly canceled an employee's appraisal may order management to change the grievant's rating only when the arbitrator is able to determine the rating that management would have given but for the violation. When an arbitrator is unable to determine what the employee's rating would have been but for the violation, the arbitrator must remand the case to management for re-evaluation. Except as otherwise provided by law, an arbitrator may not conduct an independent evaluation of the employee's performance or otherwise substitute his or her judgment for that of the supervisor.\n",

A determination as to whether a particular procedure for seeking a remedy has been elected must be made as set forth under paragraph (h)(4) of this section.\n",

                  "(i) An appeal under subpart G of this part;\n",
                  "(ii) A negotiated grievance under this section; and\n",
