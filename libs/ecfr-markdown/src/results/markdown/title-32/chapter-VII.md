**Source:** Source: 67 FR 13718, Mar. 26, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Installation Entry Policy

        § 809a.1   Random installation entry point checks.

#### § § 809a.1

        The installation commander determines when, where, and how to implement random checks of vehicles or pedestrians. The commander conducts random checks to protect the security of the command or to protect government property.

        § 809a.2   Military responsibility and authority.

#### § § 809a.2

        (a) Air Force installation commanders are responsible for protecting personnel and property under their jurisdiction and for maintaining order on installations, to ensure the uninterrupted and successful accomplishment of the Air Force mission.

        (b) Each commander is authorized to grant or deny access to their installations, and to exclude or remove persons whose presence is unauthorized. In excluding or removing persons from the installation, the installation commander must not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Their action must be reasonable in relation to their responsibility to protect and to preserve order on the installation and to safeguard persons and property thereon. As far as practicable, they should prescribe by regulation the rules and conditions governing access to their installation.

        § 809a.3   Unauthorized entry.

#### § § 809a.3

        Under Section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797), any directive issued by the commander of a military installation or facility, which includes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from a military installation, is legally enforceable against all persons whether or not those persons are subject to the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Military personnel who reenter an installation after having been properly ordered not to do so may be apprehended. Civilian violators may be detained and either escorted off the installation or turned over to proper civilian authorities. Civilian violators may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 1382.

        § 809a.4   Use of Government facilities.

#### § § 809a.4

        Commanders are prohibited from authorizing demonstrations for partisan political purposes. Demonstrations on any Air Force installation for other than political purposes may only occur with the prior approval of the installation commander. Demonstrations that could result in interference with, or prevention of, the orderly accomplishment of the mission of an installation or that present a clear danger to loyalty, discipline or morale of members of the Armed Forces will not be approved.

        § 809a.5   Barment procedures.

#### § § 809a.5

        Under the authority of 50 U.S.C. 797, installation commanders may deny access to the installation through the use of a barment order. Barment orders should be in writing but may also be oral. Security forces maintain a list of personnel barred from the installation.

      Subpart B [Reserved]

      § 809a.0   Purpose.

#### § § 809a.0

      This part prescribes the commanders' authority for enforcing order within or near Air Force installations under their jurisdiction and controlling entry to those installations. It provides guidance for use of military personnel in controlling civil disturbances and in supporting disaster relief operations. This part applies to installations in the United States, its territories and possessions, and will be used to the maximum extent possible in the overseas commands. Instructions issued by the appropriate overseas commander, status of forces agreements, and other international agreements provide more definitive guidance for the overseas commands. Nothing in this part should be construed as authorizing or requiring security forces units to collect and maintain information concerning persons or organizations having no affiliation with the Air Force other than a list of persons barred from the installation.

        (b)  Where a joint ownership or interest in real property exists, all joint owners must sign the claim form. This includes a husband and wife signing a claim if the claim is for property damage. However, only the military member or civilian employee signs the claim form for a claim under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.

        (c)  (1) A corporate officer signing the form must show title or capacity and affix the corporate seal (if any) to the claim form.

A joint claim must be asserted in the names of and signed by the real parties in interest. Make payment by sending a joint check to the subrogee, made payable to the subroger and subrogee. If separate claims are filed, make payment by check issued to each claimant to the extent of each undisputed interest.

        § 842.8   Insured claimants.

        § 842.19   Partial payments.

#### § § 842.19

        Upon request of a claimant, a settlement authority may make a partial payment in advance of final settlement when a claimant experiences personal hardship due to extensive property damage or loss. Partial payments are made if a claim for only part of the loss is submitted and is readily provable, up to the amount of the settlement authority. (The claimant may later amend the claim for the remainder of the loss.) If the total payable amount of the claim exceeds the payment limits of the settlement authority, send it with recommendations to the proper settlement authority.

        (a) If a claim for only part of the loss is submitted and is readily provable, pay it up to the amount of the settlement authority. (The claimant may later amend the claim for the remainder of the loss.) If the total payable amount of the claim exceeds the payment limits of the settlement authority, send it with recommendations through claims channels to the proper settlement authority.

        (b) When the total claim is submitted and the amount payable exceeds the settlement authority, pay a partial payment within the limits of settlement authority and send the claim, with recommendations, through claims channels to the proper settlement authority.

        § 842.20   Statute of limitations.

#### § § 842.20

        (a) The claimant must file the claim in writing within 2 years after it accrues. It accrues when the claimant discovered or reasonably should have discovered the full extent of the property damage or loss. For transportation losses, the claim usually accrues on the date of delivery.

        (b) To compute the statutory period, the incident date is excluded and the day the claim was filed is included.

        (c) Consider a claim filed after the statute has run if both of the following are present:

        (1) The United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues, or the United States enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues. Congress or the President establishes the beginning and end of war or armed conflict. A claimant may not file a claim more than 2 years after the war or armed conflict ends.

        (2) Good cause is shown. A claimant may not file a claim more than 2 years after the good cause ceases to exist.

        § 842.25   Claims payable.

#### § § 842.25

        Claims may be payable for loss of or damage to tangible personal property when the damage occurs incident to service. For loss of or damage to property to be incident to service, it must occur at a place and time that is connected to the service of an active duty military member or employment of a civilian employee.

        (a)  Claims are only payable when the claimed property is located in an authorized location. There must be some connection between the claimant's service and the location of the claimed property. Duty locations where personal property is used, stored or held because of official duties are authorized places. Other authorized places may include:

        (1) Any location on a military installation not otherwise excluded.

        (2) Any office, building, recreation area, or real estate the Air Force or any other DoD element uses or controls.

        (3) Any place a military member is required or ordered to be pursuant to their duties and while performing those duties.

        (4) Assigned Government housing or quarters in the United States or provided in kind. The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act specifically prohibits payment for loss of or damage to property in quarters within the U.S. unless the housing or quarters are assigned or otherwise provided in kind. Base housing that has not been privatized is generally considered assigned or provided in kind wherever it is located.

        (i) Privatized housing or quarters within the United States subject to the Military Housing Privatization Initiative located within the fence line of a military installation or on federal land in which the DoD has an interest is considered assigned or otherwise provided in kind for the purposes of the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (5) Housing or quarters outside the United States. Outside the US, authorized off-base quarters, as well as assigned quarters, including quarters in U.S. territories and possessions, are authorized places. The residence of a civilian employee is not an authorized location if the employee is a local inhabitant.

        (6) Temporary duty (TDY) quarters and locations en route to the TDY destination. Significant deviations from the direct travel route are not authorized locations.

        (7) Permanent change of station (PCS) temporary quarters and locations enroute to the PCS destination. Significant deviations from the direct travel route are not authorized locations.

        (8) Entitlement and benefit locations. For these locations to be authorized, the claimant must be using them for the intended purpose and the property must be reasonably linked to that purpose.

        (9) Locations where personal property shipped or stored at government expense are found. Government facilities where property is stored at the claimant's expense or for their convenience without an entitlement are not authorized places.

        (b)  Because the Personnel Claims Act (PCA) is not a substitute for private insurance, loss or damage at quarters or other authorized locations may only be paid if caused by:

        (1) An unusual occurrence;

        (2) Theft, vandalism or other malfeasance;

        (3) Hostile action;

        (4) A carrier, contractor, warehouseman or other transportation service provider storing or moving goods or privately owned vehicles at government expense;

        (5) An agent of the US; or

        (6) A permanent seizure of a witness' property by the Air Force.

        (c)  Pay for damage to or loss of POVs caused by government negligence under subpart F or K. Pay under this subpart for damage or loss incident to:

        (1) Theft of POVs or their contents, or vandalism to parked POVs:

        (i) Anywhere on a military installation.

        (ii) At offbase quarters overseas.

        (iii) At other authorized places.

        (2) Government shipment:

        (i) To or from oversea areas incident to PCS.

        (ii) On a space available reimbursable basis.

        (iii) As a replacement vehicle under the provisions of the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR).

        (3) Authorized use for government duty other than PCS moves. The owner must have specific advance permission of the appropriate supervisor or official. Adequate proof of the permission and of nonavailability of official transportation must be provided prior to paying such claims. Claims arising while the claimant is deviating from the principal route or purpose of the trip should not be paid, but claims occurring after the claimant returns to the route or purpose should be paid. Travel between quarters and place of duty, including parking, is not authorized use for government duty.

        (4) Paint spray, smokestack emission, and other similar operations by the Air Force on a military installation caused by a contractor's negligence. (Process the claim under subpart F or K, if government negligence causes such losses.) If a contractor's operation caused the damage:

        (i) Refer the claim first to the contractor for settlement.

        (ii) Settle the claim under this subpart if the contractor does not pay it or excessively delays payment, and assert a claim against the contractor.

        (d)  Pay such claims if there is no evidence of structural or mechanical failure for which the manufacturer is responsible.

        (e)  Pay for loss or damage to property claimants borrow for their use. Either the borrower or lender, if proper claimants, may file a claim. Do not pay for property borrowed to accommodate the lender, i.e., such as to avoid weight or baggage restrictions in travel.

        (f)  Pay claims of crewmembers and passengers who are in duty or leave status at the time of the incident. Payable items include jettisoned baggage, clothing worn at the time of an incident, and reasonable amounts of money, jewelry, and other personal items.

        (g)  Pay for personal property losses, whether or not the United States was involved, due to:

        (1) Enemy action.

        (2) Action to prevent capture and confiscation.

        (3) Combat activities.

        (h)  Pay for losses resulting from a claimant's acts to:

        (1) Quell a civil disturbance.

        (2) Assist during a public disaster.

        (3) Save human life.

        (4) Save government property.

        (i)  Pay for losses when:

        (1) A foreign government unjustly confiscates property.

        (2) An unjust change or application of foreign law forces surrender or abandonmnet of property.

        (j)  Pay claims for damage to eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dentures the government did not supply, when the damage results from actions beyond the normal risks associated with daily living and working. Claimants assume the risk of normal wear and tear, and their negligence bars payment of the claim.

        (k)  Pay claims for loss of money when the losses are due to theft from quarters, other authorized places, or from the person, if the claimant was required to be in the area and could not avoid the theft by due care. As a general rule, $200.00 is reasonable to have in quarters, and $100.00 is reasonable to have on the person unless:

        (1) The money was in a bona fide coin collection.

        (2) The claimant can justify possession of the money for a PCS move, extended TDY, vacation, extensive shopping trip, or similar circumstances. The claimant must show a good reason why the money had not been deposited in a bank or converted into travelers checks or a money order.

        (3) Local commercial facilities are not available or because U.S. personnel do not generally use such facilities.

Upon receipt of a claim that properly belongs with another military department, the claim is promptly transferred to that department.

        (b) The statutory time period excludes the day of the incident and includes the day the claim was filed.

        (c) A claim filed after the statute of limitations has run is considered if the U.S. is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues or if the U.S. enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues, and if good causes shows how the war or armed conflict prevented the claimant from diligently filing the claim within the statute of limitations. But in no case will a claim be considered if filed more than two years after the war or armed conflict ends.

        (1) MCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the MCA for noncombat activities. All FTCA claims are based on elements of traditional tort liability ( duty, breach, causation, and damages); that is, they are fault based. Noncombat activity claims under the MCA are based solely on causation and damages. Because MCA claims for noncombat activities are not fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA.

        (2) Claims for incident-to-service damage to vehicles caused by the negligence of a member or employee of the armed forces acting in the scope of employment are paid under the MCA, instead of the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.

        (d) Arises out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process. Exception: Unless such actions were committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer of the U.S. who is empowered by law to conduct searches, seize evidence, or make arrests for violations of federal law.

        (p) Is for the personal injury or death of military or civilian personnel of a foreign government incident to their service.

        (q) Is based on an act or omission of an employee of the government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid. Do not deny claims solely on this exception without the prior approval of USAF/JACC. Claims under the noncombat activities provision of this subpart may be paid even if this paragraph (q) applies. Is based on the exercise or performance of, or the failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or a Federal Government employee, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.

        § 842.41   Applicable law.

#### § § 842.41

        This section provides the existing law governing liability, measurement of liability and the effects of settlement upon awards.

        (a)  Many of the exclusions in this subpart are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680 or other federal statutes or court decisions interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. Federal case law interpreting the same exclusions under the Federal Tort Claims Act is applied to the Military Claims Act. Where state law differs with federal law, federal law prevails.

        (b)  Where the claim arises is important in determining the extent of liability.

        (1)  When a claim arises in the United States, its territories or possessions, the same law as if the claim was cognizable under the FTCA will be applied.

        (2)  In claims arising in a foreign country, where the claim is for personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property caused by an act or omission alleged to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel or civilian officers or employees of the United States acting within the scope of their employment, liability or the United States is determined according to federal case law interpreting the FTCA. Where the FTCA requires application of the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, settlement authorities will use the rules set forth in the currently adopted edition of the  Law, published by the American Law Institute, to evaluate the liability of the Air Force, subject to the following rules:

        (i) Foreign rules and regulations governing the operation of motor vehicles (rules of the road) are applied to the extent those rules are not specifically superseded or preempted by United States military traffic regulations.

        (ii) Absolute or strict liability will not apply for claims not arising from noncombat activities.

        (iii) Hedonic damages are not payable.

        (iv) The collateral source doctrine does not apply.

        (v) Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment will be made only upon the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the Armed Forces of the United States.

        (vi) Future economic loss will be discounted to present value after deducting for federal income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption.

        (c)  Do not approve payment for:

        (i) Punitive damages.

        (ii) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at the expense of the United States.

        (iii) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States.

        (d)  When settlement is made by an insurer or joint tortfeasor and an additional award is warranted, an award may be made if both of the following are present:

        (1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by the claimant.

        (2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.

        § 842.42   Appeal of final denials.

#### § § 842.42

        (a) A claimant may appeal the final denial of the claim. The claimant sends the request, in writing, to the settlement authority that issued the denial letter within 60 days of the date the denial letter was mailed. The settlement authority may waive the 60 day time limit for good cause.

        (b) Upon receipt of the appeal, the original settlement authority reviews the appeal.

        (c) Where the settlement authority does not reach a final agreement on an appealed claim, he or she sends the entire claim file to the next higher settlement authority, who is the appellate authority for that claim. Any higher settlement authority may act upon an appeal.

        (d) The decision of the appellate authority is the final administrative action on the claim.

For the purposes of this paragraph, an award is deemed to be the cost to the United States of any trust or structured settlement, and not its future value.

        § 842.54   Payment criteria.

#### § § 842.54

        The following criteria is considered before determining liability.

        (a) The incident causing the damage or injury must arise in a foreign country and be caused by noncombatant activities of the U.S. Armed Forces or by the negligent or wrongful acts of civilian employees or military members of the Armed Forces.

        (1) It is a prerequisite to U.S. responsibility if the employee causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war, or an interned enemy alien. These persons are “employees” within the meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does not constitute a departure from the scope of employment. The purpose of the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a U.S. Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or other equipment in the circumstances involved.

        (2) It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or omissions of any U.S. Armed Forces member or employee not listed in § 842.64(c)(1). The Act imposes responsibility on the United States when it places a U.S. citizen or non-US citizen employee in a position to cause the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and consider disciplinary action against the offender.

        (b) Scope of employment is considered in the following situations.

        (1) It is a prerequisite to U.S. responsibility if the employee causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war, or an interned enemy alien. These persons are “employees” within the meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does not constitute a departure from the scope of employment. The purpose of the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a U.S. Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or other equipment in the circumstances involved.

        (2) It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or omissions of any U.S. Armed Forces member or employee not listed in § 842.64(c)(1) of this part. The Act imposes responsibility on the United States when it places a U.S. citizen or non-US citizen employee in a position to cause the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and consider disciplinary action against the offender.

        § 842.55   Claims not payable.

#### § § 842.55

        A claim is not payable when it:

        (a) Is waived under an applicable international agreement, or pursuant to an applicable international agreement, a receiving state should adjudicate and pay the claim. However, if a foreign government subject to such an international agreement disputes its legal responsibilities under the agreement, and the claimant has no other means of compensation, USAF/JACC may authorize payment.

        § 842.56   Applicable law.

#### § § 842.56

        This section provides guidance to determine the applicable law for assessment of liability.

        (a) In adjudicating FCA claims, settlement authorities will follow the law, customs, and standards of the country where the claim arose, except:

        (1) Causation is determined based upon general principles of U.S. tort law found in federal case law and standard legal publications.

        (2) Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment is based solely on the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the U.S. Armed Forces.

        (3) If lost income or lost profits is recoverable under the law where the claim arose, they shall be limited to net lost income or net lost profits, taking into account appropriate deductions for taxes, regular business expenditures, and in the case of wrongful death, personal consumption during the loss period.

        (b) Settlement authorities will not deduct compensation from collateral sources except for:

        (1) Direct payments by a member or civilian employee of the U.S. Armed Forces for damages (not solatia).

        (2) Any payments recovered or recoverable from an insurance policy when premiums were paid, directly or indirectly, by the United States, or a member or civilian employee of the U.S. Armed Forces; or when the member or employee has the benefit of the insurance (such as when a U.S. member or employee borrows a vehicle of a local national, and the vehicle carries insurance for the benefit of any driver with permission to drive the vehicle).

#### § § 842.57

        This section provides the procedures used to reconsider a final denial.

        (a) An FCC has the inherent authority to reconsider a final decision. The mere fact that a request for reconsideration is received does not obligate the settlement authority to reopen the claim.

        (b) The FCC does not mention a reconsideration right in the original denial letter.

        (c) A settlement authority must reconsider the final action when there is:

        (1) New and material evidence concerning the claim; or

        (2) Obvious errors in the original decision.

        (d) The FCC must document in the claim file the reason for reconsideration.

        (e) A FCC above the original settlement authority may direct a claim be forwarded to a higher FCC for reconsideration.

#### § § 842.60

        The following are general definitions. See the relevant international agreement for the specific meaning of a term to use with a specific claim.

        (a)  Civilian personnel accompanying and employed by an international agreement contracting force. Local employees, contractor employees, or members of the American Red Cross are not a part of the civilian component unless specifically included in the agreement.

        (b)  A nation signing the governing agreement.

        (c)  Personnel belonging to the land, sea, or air armed services of one contracting party when in the territory of another contracting party in connection with their official duties.

        (d)  A term of art providing for settlement of claims under cost sharing international agreements in accordance with the law of the receiving state. Often, employees who are local inhabitants, not part of the civilian component of the force, could cause the sending state to be legally responsible under a respondeat superior theory.

        (e)  The country where the force or civilian component of another contracting party is temporarily located. It is often thought of as the “host nation.”

        (f)  The country sending the force or civilian component to the receiving State. In cases where U.S. personnel are stationed in a foreign country, the U.S. is the sending state.

        (g)  A term of art used in International Agreements. Parties other than members of the force and civilian component of the sending or receiving States. Dependents, tourists, and other noninhabitants of a foreign country are third parties (and therefore can generally make a claim under a SOFA) unless the international agreement, or an understanding between the countries involved, specifically excludes them.

Consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2734a and the international agreement, they may reimburse or pay the pro rata share of a claim as agreed, or if inconsistent with the IACA or the international agreement, they may object to a bill presented,

        (b)  The Secretary of the Air Force, The Judge Advocate General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General, The Director of Civil Law and Chief of the Claims and Tort Litigation Division may also exercise settlement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2734a.

        (b)  The claimant files tort claims arising from the act or omission of military or civilian personnel of another contracting party at any U.S. military installation. The Staff Judge Advocate for the installation where such military or civilian personnel is assigned or attached will promptly notify the Foreign Claims Branch of USAF/JACC as well as the Commander, U.S. Army Claims Service. If the claimant files said claim at an installation other than the location where said military or civilian personnel is assigned, the Staff Judge Advocate for that installation will promptly forward the claim to the appropriate installation Staff Judge Advocate.

        (a) Compromise of a claim is allowable when:

        (1) The tort-feasor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable time. (A sworn statement showing the debtor's assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and insurance coverage should be obtained and included in the claim file).

        (2) The Government is unable to collect a claim in full within a reasonable time even though the enforced collection proceedings are used for collection.

        (4) The government may have difficulty proving its case in court for the full amount claimed.

        (b) Compromise is not allowable when there may be fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of antitrust laws. The Department of Justice must authorize compromise of such claims.

        (1) The government is unable to collect the debt after exhausting all collection methods.

        (2) The government is unable to locate the tort-feasor.

        (3) The cost to collect will exceed recovery.

        (4) The claim is legally without merit.

        (5) The evidence does not substantiate the claim.

        (d) Suspension of collection is allowable when:

        (1) The government is unable to locate tort-feasor.

        (2) The tort-feasor is presently unable to pay but:

        (i) The statute of limitations is tolled or is running anew.

        (ii) Future collection may be possible.

#### § § 842.97

        Claims arising from noncombat activities of the United States when caused by ANG members performing duty under 32 U.S.C. and acting within the scope of their employment, whether or not such injuries or damages arose out of their negligent or wrongful acts or omissions.

> [81 FR 83697, Nov. 22, 2016]

        § 842.98   Claims not payable.

#### § § 842.98

        The following are not payable:

        (a) Claims covered by the FTCA, FCA, IACA, 10 U.S.C. 2734a and 2734b, Air Force Admiralty Claims Act (AFACA), 10 U.S.C. 9801-9804, 9806, MCA, 10 U.S.C. 2733, or covered under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act (MPCECA), 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3721.

        (b) NGCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the NGCA for noncombat activities. All FTCA claims are based on elements of traditional tort liability ( duty, breach, causation, and damages); that is, they are fault based. Noncombat activity claims under the NGCA are based solely on causation and damages. Because NGCA claims for noncombat activities are not fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA.

        (c) See subpart E of this part for other claims not payable.

        (d) Claims for damage to or loss of bailed property when the bailor specifically assumed such risk.

        (e) Claims for personal injury or death of a person covered by:

        § 842.99   Applicable law.

#### § § 842.99

        (a)  Many of the exclusions in this subpart are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680 or other federal statutes or court decisions interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. Federal case law interpreting the same exclusions under the Federal Tort Claims Act is applied to the National Guard Claims Act. Where state law differs with federal law, federal law prevails.

        (b)  Where the claim arises is important in determining the extent of liability.

        (1)  When a claim arises in the United States, its territories or possessions, the same law as if the claim was cognizable under the FTCA will be applied.

        (2)  In claims arising in a foreign country, where the claim is for personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property caused by an act or omission alleged to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel or civilian officers or employees of the United States acting within the scope of their employment, liability or the United States is determined according to federal case law interpreting the FTCA. Where the FTCA requires application of the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, settlement authorities will use the rules set forth in the currently adopted edition of the  published by the American Law Institute, to evaluate the liability of the Air Force, subject to the following rules:

        (i) Absolute or strict liability will not apply for claims not arising from noncombat activities.

        (ii) Hedonic damages are not payable.

        (iii) The collateral source doctrine will not apply.

        (iv) Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment will be made only upon the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the Armed Forces of the United States.

        (v) Future economic loss will be discounted to present value after deducting for federal income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption.

        (c)  Do not approve payment for:

        (1) Punitive damages.

        (2) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at U.S. expense.

        (3) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States.

        (d)  When settlement is made by an insurer or joint tortfeasor and an additional award is warranted, an award may be made if both of the following are present:

        (1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by the claimant.

        (2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.

#### § § 842.100

        This section explains the steps to take when a denial is appealed.

        (a) A claimant may appeal the final denial of the claim. The claimant sends the request, in writing, to the settlement authority that issued the denial letter within 60 days of the date the denial letter was mailed. The settlement authority may waive the 60 day time limit for good cause.

        (b) Upon receipt of the appeal, the original settlement authority reviews the appeal.

        (c) Where the settlement authority does not reach a final agreement on an appealed claim, he or she sends the entire claim file to the next higher settlement authority, who is the appellate authority for that claim. Any higher settlement authority may act upon an appeal.

        (d) The decision of the appellate authority is the final administrative action on the claim.

        (2) SJAs of numbered Air Forces, when given MCR claims jurisdiction, are granted authority to waive, compromise, or settle claims in amounts of $40,000 or less. This authority may be re-delegated in writing with authority to re-delegate to subordinates.

        (3) SJAs of single base GCMs, the SJAs of GCMs in PACAF and USAFE, and the SJAs of each Air Force base, station, or fixed installation have delegated authority to compromise or waive claims for $15,000 or less and to accept full payment on any claim.

        (c)  Each settlement authority has authority to assert a claim in any amount for the reasonable value of medical care.

        § 842.106   Assertable claims.

#### § § 842.106

        A claim should be asserted when the Air Force has furnished or will furnish medical care in military health care facilities or when the Air Force is responsible for reimbursement to a private care provider and either of the following conditions are met:

        (a) Third party liability in tort exists for causing an injury or disease.

        (b) Local or foreign law permits the United States to recover or the United States is a third party beneficiary under uninsured motorist coverage, medical pay insurance coverage, worker's compensation, no-fault statutes, or other statutes.

        A claim should only be asserted if the base SJA determines it merits assertion. Claims for $150 or less need not be asserted; they should be asserted only if the base SJA or designee determines the collection will not exceed the cost to collect, the third party offers payment and demands a release from the United States before paying damages to the injured party, or the United States asserts a property damage claim under subpart L arising out of the same incident.

        § 842.107   Nonassertable claims.

#### § § 842.107

        The following are considered nonassertable claims and should not be asserted:

        (a)  “Agency or instrumentality” includes any self-insured nonappropriated fund activity whether revenue producing, welfare, or sundry. The term does not include private associations.

        (b)  However, claims may be asserted for the reasonable value of medical care an Air Force member receives prior to his or her discharge and transfer to the VA facility or when the Air Force has reimbursed the VA facility for the care.

        (c)  A claim against the seaman's employer should not be filed.

        (d)  In claims in which the United States must reimburse the contractor for a claim according to the terms of the contract, settlement authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine if assertion is appropriate. If the U.S. is not required to reimburse the contractor, the MCR authority may assert a claim against the contractor.

        (e)  Settlement authorities investigate any claims that might be made against foreign governments, their political subdivisions, armed forces members or civilian employees.

        (f)  Claims are not asserted against members of the uniformed services; employees of the US, its agencies or instrumentalities; or an individual who is a dependent of a service member or employee at the time of assertion unless they have insurance to pay the claim, they were required by law or regulation to have insurance which would have covered the Air Force, or their actions, which necessitated the medical treatment provided at government expense, constituted willful misconduct or gross negligence.

> [81 FR 83699, Nov. 22, 2016]

        § 842.108   Asserting the claim.

#### § § 842.108

        When asserting the claim, the base SJA will:

        (a) MCR personnel assert a claim against a tortfeasor or other third party using a formal letter on Air Force stationery. The assertion is made against all potential payers, including insurers. The demand letter should state the legal basis for recovery and sufficiently describe the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to medical care. Applicable bases of recovery include U.S. status as a third-party beneficiary under various types of insurance policies, workers' compensation laws, no-fault laws, or other Federal statutes, including Coordination of Benefits (COB) or FMCRA.

        (b) The MCR authority must promptly notify the injured parties or their legal representatives, in writing, that the United States will attempt to recover from the third parties the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished and that they:

        (1) Should seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian counsel.

        (2) Must cooperate in the prosecution of all actions of the United States against third parties.

        (3) Must furnish a complete statement regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident which caused the injury.

        (4) Must not execute a release or settle any claim which exists as a result of the injury without prior notice to the MCR authority.

        (c) Mail all copies of the SF 96, or claim notice on Air Force letterhead:

        (1) By certified mail with return receipt requested in all claims in which the amount claimed is $5,000.00 or more or in which there is a substantial likelihood that the final amount claimed will be $5,000.00 or more.

        (2) By regular or certified mail with return receipt requested at the SJA's discretion in cases in which the final amount claimed is less than $5,000.00, unless there is no response to the initial notice of claim within a reasonable period of time and a second notice of claim is required to be mailed. All second notices of claim and copies will be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested.

        (d) Notify the injured parties promptly in writing that the United States will attempt to recover from the third parties the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished and that they:

        (1) Should seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian counsel and furnish the civilian counsel's name to the claims officer.

        (2) Must cooperate in the prosecution of all actions of the United States against third parties.

        (3) Must furnish a complete statement regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident which caused the injury.

#### § § 842.112

        Waivers and compromises of government claims can be made. This section lists the basic guidance for each action. (See this subpart for claims involving waiver and compromise of amounts in excess of settlement authorities' delegated amounts.)

        (a)  When compromising or waiving a claim for convenience of the Government, settlement authorities should consider the following factors:

        (1) Risks of litigation.

        (2) Questionable liability of the third party.

        (3) Costs of litigation.

        (4) Insurance (Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist and Medical Payment Coverage) or other assets of the tortfeasor available to satisfy a judgment for the entire claim.

        (5) Potential counterclaim against the U.S.

        (6) Jury verdict expectancy amount.

        (7) Amount of settlement with proposed distribution.

        (8) Cost of any future care.

        (9) Tortfeasor cannot be located.

        (10) Tortfeasor is judgment proof.

        (11) Tortfeasor has refused to pay and the case is too weak for litigation.

        (b)  When compromising or waiving a claim to avoid undue hardship on the injured party, settlement authorities should consider the following factors:

        (1) Permanent disability or disfigurement of the injured party.

        (2) Decreased earning power of the injured party.

        (3) Out of pocket losses to the injured party.

        (4) Financial status of the injured party.

        (5) Pension rights of the injured party.

        (6) Other government benefits available to the injured party.

        (7) An offer of settlement from a third party which includes virtually all of the thirty party's assets, although the amount is considerably less than the calculation of the injured party's damages.

        (8) Whether the injured party received excessive treatment.

        (9) Amount of settlement with proposed distribution, including reductions in fees or damages by other parties, medical providers, or attorneys in order to reduce the hardship on the injured party.

        (c)  A compromise or waiver can be made upon written request from the injured party or the injured party's legal representative.

        § 842.113   Reconsideration of a waiver for undue hardship.

#### § § 842.113

        A settlement authority may reconsider its previous action on a request for waiver or compromise whether requested or not. Reconsideration is normally on the basis of new evidence or discovery of errors in the waiver submission or settlement, but can be based upon a re-evaluation of the claim by the settlement authority.

#### § § 842.119

        (a)  A federally chartered, non-profit corporation which was designated by Congress in 1948 as a volunteer civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.

        (b)  Although not defined in any statute, an Air Force noncombat mission is any mission for which the Air Force is tasked, by statute, regulation, or higher authority, which does not involve actual combat, combat operations or combat training. The Air Force, in lieu of using Air Force resources, can use the services of the Civil Air Patrol to fulfill these type missions. When performing an Air Force noncombat mission, the Civil Air Patrol is deemed to be an instrumentality of the United States. In order for a mission to be a noncombat mission of the Air Force under this part, it must either:

        (1) Have a special Air Force mission order assigned, and, the Air Force must exercise operational control over the mission.

        (2) Involve a peacetime mission the Air Force is tasked to perform by higher authority which requires the expenditure of Air Force resources to accomplish, and the Air Force specifically approves the mission as a noncombat mission, and assigns the mission to the Civil Air Patrol to perform.

        (c)  CAP members are private citizens who volunteer their time, services, and resources to accomplish CAP objectives and purposes. The two primary categories of members are:

        (1)  Youths, 13 years (or having satisfactorily completed the sixth grade) through 17 years of age, who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish from time to time. Cadet status may be retained until age 21.

        (2)  Adults, 18 years of age or older (there is no maximum age), who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish from time to time, and who have not retained cadet status.

        (d)  Active duty Air Force officers assigned to liaison duty at the national, regional, and wing (state) levels of CAP.

        (b) Is for personal services or expenses incurred by CAP or its members while engaged in an Air Force noncombat mission, or other specified Air Force authorized mission.

        (c) Arises out of a CAP incident based solely on government ownership of property on loan to CAP.

        (d) Arises from a CAP activity not performed as a noncombat mission of the Air Force or as a specified Air Force authorized mission. These claims are sent to HQ CAP-USAF/JA for referral to CAP's private insurer, with a copy of the transmittal letter to AFLOA/JACC.

#### § § 845.1

      This part establishes criteria and assigns responsibility for the provision of counsel, for the provision of bail, and for the payment of court costs and other necessary and reasonable expenses incident to representation in civil and criminal proceedings, including appellate proceedings, before foreign courts and foreign administrative agencies, which involve members of the Armed Forces, civilian personnel and dependents. Payment of fines is not authorized hereunder.

      § 845.2   Statutory authority.

#### § § 845.2

      10 U.S.C. 1037 provides authority for employment of counsel, and payment of counsel fees, court costs, bail, and other expenses incident to representation of persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice before foreign tribunals. For personnel not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, funds for similar expenses may be made available in cases of exceptional interest to the service concerned, upon prior application through the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned, to the appropriate service secretary.

      § 845.3   Responsibility.

#### § § 845.3

      (a) Requests for provision of counsel, provision of bail, or payment of expenses will ordinarily be made by the defendant or accused through appropriate channels to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over him. This officer shall determine whether the request meets the criteria prescribed herein and, based upon such determination, shall take final action approving or disapproving the request. Within their geographical areas of responsibility, major commands in the interest of obtaining prompt and effective legal service may appoint as approval authority, instead of the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, any subordinate officer having responsibility in a particular country for personnel subject to foreign criminal jurisdiction.

      (b) Notwithstanding the criteria prescribed below, an officer exercising approved authority may, in his discretion, deny a request for the provision of counsel, provision of bail or payment of expenses, where the otherwise eligible requestor is in an absent without leave or deserter status at the time of the request, or otherwise is not then subject to United States military control, and there is no reasonable basis for the belief that the requestor will return to United States military control at the conclusion of the proceedings of service of an adjudged sentence, if any.

      § 845.4   Criteria for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in criminal cases.

#### § § 845.4

      Requests for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in criminal cases may be approved in pretrial, trial, appellate and posttrial proceedings in any one of the following criminal cases:

      (a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of official duty; or

      (b) Where the sentence which is normally imposed includes confinement, whether or not such sentence is suspended; or

      (c) Where capital punishment might be imposed; or

      (d) Where an appeal is made from any proceeding in which there appears to have been a denial of the substantial rights of the accused; or

      (e) Where conviction of the offense alleged could later form the basis for administrative discharge proceedings for misconduct as a result of civil court disposition; or

      (f) Where the case, although not within the criteria established in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, is considered to have significant impact upon the relations of US forces with the host country or is considered to involve any other particular US interest.

      § 845.5   Provision of bail in criminal cases.

#### § § 845.5

      Funds for the posting of bail or bond to secure the release of personnel from confinement by foreign authorities before, during, or after trial may be furnished in all criminal cases. Safeguards should be imposed to assure that at the conclusion of the proceedings or on the appearance of the defendant in court, the bail or bond will be refunded to the military authorities. Bail will be provided only to guarantee the presence of the defendant and will not be provided to guarantee the payment of fines or civil damages. Local US military authorities are expected to provide bail, in any case, only after other reasonable efforts have been made to secure release of pretrial custody to the US.

      § 845.6   Criteria for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in civil cases.

#### § § 845.6

      Requests for provision of counsel and payment of expenses in civil cases may be granted in trial and appellate proceedings in either of the following civil cases:

      (a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of official duty; or

      (b) Where the case is considered to have a significant impact upon the relations of US forces with the host country or is considered to involve any other particular US interest. No funds shall be provided under this part in cases where the United States of America is in legal effect the defendant, without prior authorization of the Judge Advocate General.

      § 845.7   Procedures for hiring counsel and obligating funds.

#### § § 845.7

      (a) The selection of individual trial or appellate counsel will be made by the defendant. Such counsel shall represent the individual defendant and not the US Government. Selection shall be made from approved lists of attorneys who are qualified, competent and experienced in trial practice, and admitted for full practice, on their own account, before the courts of the foreign country involved. Normally, these lists will be coordinated with the local court or bar association, if any, and the appropriate US Diplomatic or Consular Mission and should include only those attorneys who are known or reputed, to comply with local attorney fee schedules or guides approved or suggested by local bar associations and should not exceed amounts paid under similar circumstances by nationals of the country where the trial is held. No fee may include any amount in payment for services other than those incident to representation before judicial and administrative agencies of the foreign country in the particular case for which the contract is made, and in no event may any contract include fees for representation in habeas corpus or related proceedings before tribunals of the United States. When appropriate and reasonable in the case, the payment of expenses, in addition to counsel fees, may include court costs, bail costs, charges for obtaining copies of records, printing and filing fees, interpreter fees, witness fees, and other necessary and reasonable expenses. Expenses will not include the payment of fines or civil damages, directly or indirectly.

      (b) Whenever possible, the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee), acting on behalf of the United States of America, shall enter into a written contract with the selected counsel. The contract will cover counsel fees, and, when appropriate, may cover other costs arising in defense of the case only in the court of first instance and will not include fees for representation on appeal. If the case is appealed to higher tribunals, supplemental agreements shall be executed for each appeal. A copy of the contractual agreement shall serve as the obligating document.

      (c) If, for example, because of unusual circumstances or local customs, it is not practicable to enter into a written contract as in paragraph (b) of this section, action will be taken to record the agreement reached between the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee) and the selected counsel. This requirement may be met by a letter of commission or letter of understanding, executed between the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee) and the selected counsel, or by a written request for legal services expressly or impliedly accepted by the selected counsel. Any such document shall contain, if possible, an agreed estimate of counsel fees and reasonable expenses and a statement that both fees and expenses will conform to those paid by local nationals under similar circumstances and will not exceed local fee schedules, if any. If this document does not include an agreed estimate of counsel fees and other reasonable expenses, an estimate will be provided by the contracting officer. A copy of the document, together with the estimate, will be furnished the accounting component and will serve as the commitment document for the reservation of funds.

      (d) The provision of counsel and payment of expenses under this part is not subject to the provisions of the Defense Acquisition Regulation (subchapter A, chapter I of this title). However, the contract clauses set forth in part 5, section VII, Defense Acquisition Regulation, may be used as a guide in contracting.

      (e) Because of the desirability of timely procedural action, it is suggested that there be designated, from among the judge advocates on the staffs of officers responsible under § 845.3, contracting officers with contracting authority limited to agreements described in this section. The effect of this designation would be to combine within one office the duties of contracting officer and judge advocate.

      (f) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting the selection of qualified local counsel employed by the United States Government, if the serviceman freely selects such counsel.

      § 845.8   Payment of counsel fees and other expenses.

#### § § 845.8

      Payment of bills submitted by the selected counsel and other costs shall be made in accordance with the general provision of AFM 177-102 (Commercial Transactions at Base Level), relating to payment of contractual obligations and pertinent disbursing regulations. All payments under these procedures will be in local currency. Acceptance of services procured under these procedures shall be certified to by the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee). Payments of bail may be made when authorized by such officers. Such authorization shall be in the form of a directing letter or message citing 10 U.S.C. 1037.

      § 845.9   Appropriated funds chargeable.

#### § § 845.9

      Authorized expenses incurred incident to implementation of the policies set forth in this part, including transportation and per diem expenses of trial observers, interpreters, and local counsel employees, shall be paid from appropriated funds of the service to which the defendant belongs. Payments shall be made from the appropriation current at time of payment, unless obligations for authorized costs have previously been established. Refunds shall be processed as appropriation refund. Such funds are chargeable to the base for operation and maintenance purposes (O&M or R&D, as applicable).

      § 845.10   Reimbursement.

#### § § 845.10

      No reimbursement will ordinarily be required from individuals with respect to payments made in their behalf under this part. However, prior to the posting of bail on behalf of a defendant, a signed agreement shall be secured from him wherein he agrees to remit the amount of such bail or permit the application of so much of his pay as may be necessary to reimburse the Government in the event that he willfully causes forfeiture of bail. In the event of such forfeiture, bail provided under this part shall be recovered from the defendant in accordance with that agreement. The agreement should include a statement that it does not prejudice the defendant's right to appeal to the Comptroller General of the United States and the courts after such payment or deduction has been made, if he considers the amount erroneous.

      § 845.11   Correspondence.

#### § § 845.11

      Judge advocates who advise officers responsible under § 845.3 are authorized to correspond directly with each other and with the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned for advice with regard to payment of counsel fees and other expenses.

    PART 855—CIVIL AIRCRAFT USE OF UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIRFIELDS

### Part 855

**Authority:** Authority: 49 U.S.C. 44502 and 47103.

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 37349, July 20, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 855.1   Policy.

#### § § 855.1

        The Air Force establishes and uses its airfields to support the scope and level of operations necessary to carry out missions worldwide. The Congress funds airfields in response to Air Force requirements, but also specifies that civil aviation access is a national priority to be accommodated when it does not jeopardize an installation's military utility. The Air Force engages in dialogue with the civil aviation community and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure mutual understanding of long-term needs for the national air transportation system and programmed military force structure requirements. To implement the national policy and to respond to requests for access, the Air Force must have policies that balance such requests with military needs. Civil aircraft access to Air Force airfields on foreign territory requires host nation approval.

        (a) The Air Force will manage two programs that are generally used to grant civil aircraft access to its airfields: civil aircraft landing permits and joint-use agreements. Other arrangements for access will be negotiated as required for specific purposes.

        (1) Normally, landing permits will be issued only for civil aircraft operating in support of official Government business. Other types of use may be authorized if justified by exceptional circumstances. Access will be granted on an equitable basis.

        (2) The Air Force will consider only proposals for joint use that do not compromise operations, security, readiness, safety, environment, and quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized local Government representatives eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint-use agreement.

        (3) Any aircraft operator with an inflight emergency may land at any Air Force airfield without prior authorization. An inflight emergency is defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.

        (b) Air Force requirements will take precedence on Air Force airfields over all civil aircraft operations, whether they were previously authorized or not.

        (c) Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in the United States will be subject to Federal laws and regulations. Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in foreign countries will be subject to US Federal laws and regulations that have extraterritorial effect and to applicable international agreements with the country in which the Air Force installation is located.

        § 855.2   Responsibilities.

#### § § 855.2

        (a) As the program manager for joint use, the Civil Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/XOOBC), ensures that all impacts have been considered and addressed before forwarding a joint-use proposal or agreement to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Installations (SAF/MII), who holds decision authority. All decisions are subject to the environmental impact analysis process as directed by the Environmental Planning Division, Directorate of Environment (HQ USAF/CEVP), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (SAF/MIQ). The Air Force Real Estate Agency (AFREA/MI) handles the leases for Air Force-owned land or facilities that may be included in an agreement for joint use.

        (b) HQ USAF/XOOBC determines the level of decision authority for landing permits. It delegates decision authority for certain types of use to major commands and installation commanders.

        (c) HQ USAF/XOOBC makes the decisions on all requests for exceptions or waivers to this part and related Air Force instructions. The decision process includes consultation with other affected functional area managers when required. Potential impacts on current and future Air Force policies and operations strongly influence such decisions.

        (d) Major commands, direct reporting units, and field operating agencies may issue supplements to establish command-unique procedures permitted by and consistent with this part.

        § 855.3   Applicability.

#### § § 855.3

        This part applies to all regular United States Air Force (USAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) installations with airfields. This part also applies to civil aircraft use of Air Force ramps at civil airports hosting USAF, ANG, and USAFR units.

      Subpart B—Civil Aircraft Landing Permits

        § 855.4   Scope.

#### § § 855.4

        Air Force airfields are available for use by civil aircraft so far as such use does not interfere with military operations or jeopardize the military utility of the installation. Access will be granted on an equitable basis. Air Force requirements take precedence over authorized civil aircraft use. This part carries the force of US law, and exceptions are not authorized without prior approval from the Civil Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations, (HQ USAF/XOOBC), 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480. Proposed exceptions or waivers are evaluated as to current and future impact on Air Force policy and operations.

        § 855.5   Responsibilities and authorities.

#### § § 855.5

        (a) The Air Force:

        (1) Determines whether civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields is compatible with current and planned military activities.

        (2) Normally authorizes civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields only in support of official Government business. If exceptional circumstances warrant, use for other purposes may be authorized.

        (3) Acts as clearing authority for civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields, subject to the laws and regulations of the US, or to applicable international agreements (e.g., status of forces agreements) with the country in which the Air Force installation is located.

        (4) Reserves the right to suspend any operation that is inconsistent with national defense interests or deemed not in the best interests of the Air Force.

        (5) Will terminate authority to use an Air Force airfield if the:

        (i) User's liability insurance is canceled.

        (ii) User lands for other than the approved purpose of use or is otherwise in violation of this part or clearances and directives hereunder.

        (6) Will not authorize use of Air Force airfields:

        (i) In competition with civil airports by providing services or facilities that are already available in the private sector.

        (ii) Solely for the convenience of passengers or aircraft operator.

        (iii) Solely for transient aircraft servicing.

        (iv) By civil aircraft that do not meet US Department of Transportation operating and airworthiness standards.

        (v) That selectively promotes, benefits, or favors a specific commercial venture unless equitable consideration is available to all potential users in like circumstances.

        (vi) For unsolicited proposals in procuring Government business or contracts.

        (vii) Solely for customs-handling purposes.

        (viii) When the air traffic control tower and base operations are closed or when a runway is restricted from use by all aircraft.

        (7) Will not authorize civil aircraft use of Air Force ramps located on civil airfields.

        (b) Civil aircraft operators must:

        (1) Have an approved DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing Permit, before operating at Air Force airfields, except for emergency use and as indicated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, and , and § 855.13(b)(1)(ii).

        (2) Ensure that pavement load-bearing capacity will support the aircraft to be operated at the Air Force airfield.

        (3) Ensure that aircraft to be operated at Air Force airfields are equipped with an operating two-way radio capable of communicating with the air traffic control tower.

        (4) Obtain final approval for landing from the installation commander or a designated representative (normally base operations) at least 24 hours prior to arrival.

        (5) Not assume that the landing clearance granted by an air traffic control tower facility is a substitute for either the approved civil aircraft landing permit or approval from the installation commander or a designated representative (normally base operations).

        (6) Obtain required diplomatic or overflight clearance before operating in foreign airspace.

        (7) Pay applicable costs and fees.

        (8) File a flight plan before departing the Air Force airfield.

        (c) The installation commander or a designated representative:

        (1) Exercises administrative and security control over both the aircraft and passengers while on the installation.

        (2) May require civil users to delay, reschedule, or reroute aircraft arrivals or departures to preclude interference with military activities.

        (3) Cooperates with customs, immigration, health, and other public authorities in connection with civil aircraft arrival and departure.

        (d) Decision Authority: The authority to grant civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields is vested in:

        (1) Directorate of Operations, Bases and Units Division, Civil Aviation Branch (HQ USAF/XOOBC). HQ USAF/XOOBC may act on any request for civil aircraft use of an Air Force airfield. Decision authority for the following will not be delegated below HQ USAF:

        (i) Use of multiple Air Force airfields except as designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (ii) Those designated as 2 under Approval Authority in Table 1 to this part.

        (iii) Any unusual or unique purpose of use not specifically addressed in this part.

        (2) Major Command, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, or Installation Commander. With the exception of those uses specifically delegated to another decision authority, major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOAs), direct reporting units (DRUs) and installation commanders or designated representatives have the authority to approve or disapprove civil aircraft landing permit applications (DD Forms 2400, Civil Aircraft Certificate of Insurance; 2401; Civil Aircraft Landing Permit, and 2402, Civil Aircraft Hold Harmless Agreement) at airfields for which they hold oversight responsibilities. Additionally, for expeditious handling of short notice requests, they may grant requests for one-time, official Government business flights that are in the best interest of the US Government and do not violate other provisions of this part. As a minimum, for one-time flights authorized under this section, the aircraft owner or operator must provide the decision authority with insurance verification and a completed DD Form 2402 before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield. Air Force authority to approve civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields on foreign soil may be limited. Commanders outside the US must be familiar with base rights agreements or other international agreements that may render inapplicable, in part or in whole, provisions of this part. Decision authority is delegated for specific purposes of use and or locations as follows:

        (i) Commander, 611th Air Operations Group (AOG). The Commander, 611th AOG or a designated representative may approve commercial charters, on a case-by-case basis, at all Air Force airfields in Alaska, except Eielson and Elmendorf AFBs, if the purpose of the charter is to transport goods and or materials, such as an electric generator or construction materials for a community center, for the benefit of remote communities that do not have adequate civil airports.

        (ii) Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Commander, AMC or a designated representative may approve permits that grant landing rights at Air Force airfields worldwide in support of AMC contracts.

        (iii) US Defense Attache Office (USDAO). The USDAO, acting on behalf of HQ USAF/XOOBC, may grant a request for one-time landing rights at an Air Force airfield provided:

        (A) The request is for official Government business of either the US or the country to which the USDAO is accredited.

        (B) The Air Force airfield is located within the country to which the USDAO is accredited.

        (C) Approval will not violate any agreement with the host country.

        (D) The installation commander concurs.

        (E) The USDAO has a properly completed DD Form 2402 on file and has verified that the insurance coverage meets the requirements of Table 2 to this part, before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield.

        § 855.6   Aircraft exempt from the requirement for a civil aircraft landing permit.

#### § § 855.6

        (a) Any aircraft owned by:

        (1) Any other US Government agency.

        (2) US Air Force aero clubs established as prescribed in AFI 34-117, Air Force Aero Club Program, and AFMAN 3-132, Air Force Aero Club Operations  .

        (3) Aero clubs of other US military services.

        (4) A US State, County, Municipality, or other political subdivision, when operating to support official business at any level of Government.

        (b) Any civil aircraft under:

        (1) Lease or contractual agreement for exclusive US Government use on a long-term basis and operated on official business by or for a US Government agency; for example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of the Interior, or Department of Energy.

        (2) Lease or contractual agreement to the Air Force for Air Force Civil Air Patrol (CAP) liaison purposes and operated by an Air Force CAP liaison officer on official Air Force business.

        (3) CAP control for a specific mission directed by the Air Force.

        (4) Coast Guard control for a specific mission directed by the Coast Guard.

        (5) Contractual agreement to any US, State, or local Government agency in support of operations involving safety of life or property as a result of a disaster.

        (6) Government furnished property or bailment contract for use by a contractor, provided the Federal, State, or local Government has retained liability responsibilities.

        (7) Civil aircraft transporting critically ill or injured individuals or transplant organs to or from an Air Force installation.

        (8) Historic aircraft being delivered for Air Force museum exhibits under the provisions of AFI 84-103, Museum System.

        § 855.7   Conditions for use of Air Force airfields.

#### § § 855.7

        The Air Force authorizes use of its airfields for a specific purpose by a named individual or company. The authorization cannot be transferred to a second or third party and does not extend to use for other purposes. An approved landing permit does not obligate the Air Force to provide supplies, equipment, or facilities other than the landing, taxiing, and parking areas. The aircraft crew and passengers are only authorized activities at the installation directly related to the purpose for which use is granted. All users are expected to submit their application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) at least 30 days before intended use and, except for use as a weather alternate, CRAF alternate, or emergency landing site, must contact the appropriate installation commander or a designated representative for final landing approval at least 24 hours before arrival. Failure to comply with either time limit may result in denied landing rights.

        § 855.8   Application procedures.

#### § § 855.8

        To allow time for processing, the application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) and a self-addressed, stamped envelope should be submitted at least 30 days before the date of the first intended landing. The verification required for each purpose of use must be included with the application. The name of the user must be the same on all forms. Original, hand scribed signatures, not facsimile elements, are required on all forms. Landing Permit Application Instructions are at attachment 3 to this part. The user is responsible for reviewing this part and accurately completing the forms before submitting them to the approving authority.

        § 855.9   Permit renewal.

#### § § 855.9

        When a landing permit expires, DD Forms 2401 and 2400 must be resubmitted for continued use of Air Force airfields.

        § 855.10   Purpose of use.

#### § § 855.10

        The purposes of use normally associated with civil aircraft operations at Air Force airfields are listed in Table 1. Requests for use for purposes other than those listed will be considered and may be approved if warranted by unique circumstances. A separate DD Form 2401 is required for each purpose of use. (Users can have multiple DD Forms 2401 that are covered by a single DD Form 2400 and DD Form 2402.)

        § 855.11   Insurance requirements.

#### § § 855.11

        Applicants must provide proof of third-party liability insurance on a DD Form 2400, with the amounts stated in US dollars. The policy number, effective date, and expiration date are required. The statement “until canceled” may be used in lieu of a specific expiration date. The geographic coverage must include the area where the Air Force airfield of proposed use is located. If several aircraft or aircraft types are included under the same policy, a statement such as “all aircraft owned,” “all aircraft owned and or operated,” “all non-owned aircraft,” or “all aircraft operated,” may be used in lieu of aircraft registration numbers. To meet the insurance requirements, either split limit coverage for bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers, or a single limit coverage is required. The coverage will be at the expense of the user with an insurance company acceptable to the Air Force. Coverage must be current during the period the Air Force airfield will be used. The liability required is computed on the basis of aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) and passenger or cargo configuration. Minimum coverage will not be less than the amount indicated in Table 2 to this part.

        (a) Any insurance presented as a single limit of liability or a combination of primary and excess coverage will be an amount equal to or greater than the each accident minimums indicated in Table 2 to this part for bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers.

        (b) The policy will specifically provide that:

        (1) The insurer waives any right of subrogation it may have against the US by reason of any payment made under the policy for injury, death, or property damage that might arise, out of or in connection with the insured's use of any Air Force airfield.

        (2) The insurance afforded by the policy applies to the liability assumed by the insured under DD Form 2402.

        (3) If the insurer or the insured cancels or reduces the amount of insurance afforded under the listed policy before the expiration date indicated on DD Form 2400, the insurer will send written notice of policy cancellation or coverage reduction to the Air Force approving authority at least 30 days before the effective date of the cancellation or reduction. The policy must state that any cancellation or reduction will not be effective until at least 30 days after such notice is sent.

        § 855.12   Processing a permit application.

#### § § 855.12

        Upon receipt of an application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) for use of an Air Force airfield, the decision authority:

        (a) Determines the availability of the airfield and its capability to accommodate the purpose of use requested.

        (b) Determines the validity of the request and ensures all entries on DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402 are in conformance with this part.

        (c) Approves DD Form 2401 (with conditions or limitations noted) by completing all items in Section II—For Use by Approving Authority as follows:

        (1) Period of Use (Block 7): The “From” date will be either the first day of approved use or the first day of insurance coverage. The “From” date cannot precede the first day of insurance coverage shown on the DD Form 2400. The “Thru” date is determined by the insurance expiration date and or the purpose of use. For example, the period of use for participants in an Air Force open house will be determined by both insurance coverage and open house dates. The permit would be issued only for the duration of the open house but must not precede or exceed the dates of insurance coverage. Many insurance policies terminate at noon on the expiration date. Therefore, if the insurance expiration is used to determine the permit expiration date, the landing permit will expire one day before the insurance expiration date shown on the DD Form 2400. If the insurance expiration date either exceeds 2 years or is indefinite (for example, “until canceled”), the landing permit will expire 2 years from the issue date or first day of coverage.

        (2) Frequency of Use (Block 8) is normally “as required” but may be more specific, such as “one time.”

        (3) Identification Number (Block 9): Installation commanders or a designated representative assign a permit number comprised of the last three letters of the installation's International Civil Aviation Organization identifier code, the last two digits of the calendar year, a number sequentially assigned, and the letter suffix that indicates the purpose of use (Table 1); for example, ADW 95-01C. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and USDAOs use a three position organization abbreviation; such as AMC 95-02K.

        (4) DD Form 2400 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11a): This block should contain the date from block 1 (Date Issued) on the DD Form 2400 and the identification of the unit or base where the form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        (5) DD Form 2402 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11b): This block should contain the date from block 4 (Date Signed) on the DD Form 2402 and the identification of the unit or base where the form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        (6) SA-ALC/SFR, 1014 Andrews Road, Building 1621, Kelly AFB TX 78241-5603 publishes the list of companies authorized to purchase Air Force fuel on credit. Block 12 should be marked “yes” only if the permit holder's name appears on the SA-ALC list.

        (7) Landing Fees, Block 13, should be marked as indicated in Table 1 to this part.

        (8) Permit Amendments: New entries or revisions to an approved DD Form 2401 may be made only by or with the consent of the approving authority.

        (d) Provides the applicant with written disapproval if:

        (1) Use will interfere with operations, security, or safety.

        (2) Adequate civil facilities are collocated.

        (3) Purpose of use is not official Government business and adequate civil facilities are available in the proximity of the requested Air Force airfield.

        (4) Use will constitute competition with civil airports or air carriers.

        (5) Applicant has not fully complied with this part.

        (e) Distributes the approved DD Form 2401 before the first intended landing, when possible, as follows:

        (1) Retains original.

        (2) Returns two copies to the user.

        (3) Provides a copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        § 855.13   Civil fly-ins.

#### § § 855.13

        (a) Civil aircraft operators may be invited to a specified Air Force airfield for:

        (1) A base open house to perform or provide a static display.

        (2) A flying safety seminar.

        (b) Civil fly-in procedures:

        (1) The installation commander or a designated representative:

        (i) Requests approval from the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC.

        (ii) Ensures that DD Form 2402 is completed by each user.

        (2) The MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU ensures HQ USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC are advised of the approval or disapproval for the fly-in.

        (3) Aerial performance by civil aircraft at an Air Force open house requires MAJCOM or FOA approval and an approved landing permit as specified in AFI 35-201, Community Relations  . Regardless of the aircraft's historic military significance, DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402 must be submitted and approved before the performance. The permit can be approved at MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or installation level. Use will be authorized only for the period of the event. Fly-in procedures do not apply to aircraft transporting passengers (revenue or non-revenue) for the purpose of attending the open house or demonstration flights associated with marketing a product.

        § 855.14   Unauthorized landings.

#### § § 855.14

        (a)  The installation commander or a designated representative will identify an unauthorized landing as either an emergency landing, an inadvertent landing, or an intentional landing. An unauthorized landing may be designated as inadvertent or intentional whether or not the operator has knowledge of the provisions of this part, and whether or not the operator filed a flight plan identifying the installation as a destination. Aircraft must depart the installation as soon as practical. On all unauthorized landings, the installation commander or a designated representative:

        (1) Informs the operator of subpart  B procedures and the requirement for notifying the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as specified in section 6 of the FAA Airman's Information Manual.

        (2) Notifies the Federal Aviation Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) by telephone or telefax, followed by written notification using FAA Form 8020-9, 8020-11, or 8020-17, as appropriate. A copy of the written notification must be provided to HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        (3) Ensures the operator completes a DD Form 2402, and collects applicable charges. (In some instances, it may be necessary to arrange to bill the user for the appropriate charges.) DD Form 2402 need not be completed for commercial carriers if it is known that the form is already on file at HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        (4) In a foreign country, notifies the local US Defense Attache Office (USDAO) by telephone or telefax and, where applicable, the appropriate USDAO in the country of aircraft registry, followed by written notification with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC and the civil aviation authority of the country or countries concerned.

        (b)  Any aircraft operator who experiences an inflight emergency may land at any Air Force airfield without prior authorization (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours prior notice). An inflight emergency is defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.

        (1) The Air Force will use any method or means to clear an aircraft or wreckage from the runway to preclude interference with essential military operations after coordinating with the FSDO and National Transportation Safety Board. Removal efforts will minimize damage to the aircraft or wreckage; however, military or other operational factors may be overriding.

        (2) An operator making an emergency landing:

        (i) Is not charged a landing fee.

        (ii) Pays all costs for labor, material, parts, use of equipment and tools, and so forth, to include, but not limited to:

        (A) Spreading foam on the runway.

        (B) Damage to runway, lighting, and navigation aids.

        (C) Rescue, crash, and fire control services.

        (D) Movement and storage of aircraft.

        (E) Performance of minor maintenance.

        (F) Fuel or oil (AFM 67-1, vol 1, part three, chapter 1, Air Force Stock Fund and DPSC Assigned Item Procedures  ).

        (c)  (1) The installation commander or a designated representative may determine a landing to be inadvertent if the aircraft operator:

        (i) Landed due to flight disorientation.

        (ii) Mistook the Air Force airfield for a civil airport.

        (2) Normal landing fees must be charged and an unauthorized landing fee may be assessed to compensate the Government for the added time, effort, and risk involved in the inadvertent landing. Only the unauthorized landing fee may be waived by the installation commander or a designated representative if, after interviewing the pilot-in-command and appropriate Government personnel, it is determined that flying safety was not significantly impaired. The pilot-in-command may appeal the imposition of an unauthorized landing fee for an inadvertent landing to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU whose decision will be final. A subsequent inadvertent landing will be processed as an intentional unauthorized landing.

        (d)  (1) The installation commander may categorize an unauthorized landing as intentional when there is unequivocal evidence that the pilot deliberately:

        (i) Landed without an approved DD Form 2401 on board the aircraft.

        (ii) Landed for a purpose not approved on the DD Form 2401.

        (iii) Operated an aircraft not of a model or registration number on the approved DD Form 2401.

        (iv) Did not request or obtain the required final approval from the installation commander or a designated representative at least 24 hours before aircraft arrival.

        (v) Did not obtain landing clearance from the air traffic control tower.

        (vi) Landed with an expired DD Form 2401.

        (vii) Obtained landing authorization through fraudulent methods, or

        (viii) Landed after having been denied a request to land from any Air Force authority, including the control tower.

        (2) Normal landing fees and an unauthorized landing fee must be charged. Intentional unauthorized landings increase reporting, processing, and staffing costs; therefore, the unauthorized landing fee for paragraph (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(vi) of this section will be increased by 100 percent. The unauthorized landing fee will be increased 200 percent for paragraph (d)(1)(vii) and (d)(1)(viii) of this section.

        (3) Intentional unauthorized landings may be prosecuted as a criminal trespass, especially if a debarment letter has been issued. Repeated intentional unauthorized landings prejudice the user's FAA operating authority and jeopardize future use of Air Force airfields.

        § 855.15   Detaining an aircraft.

#### § § 855.15

        (a) An installation commander in the United States, its territories, or its possessions may choose to detain an aircraft for an intentional unauthorized landing until:

        (1) The unauthorized landing has been reported to the FAA, HQ USAF/XOOBC, and the appropriate US Attorney.

        (2) All applicable charges have been paid.

        (b) If the installation commander wishes to release the aircraft before the investigation is completed, he or she must obtain bond, promissory note, or other security for payment of the highest charge that may be assessed.

        (c) The pilot and passengers will not be detained longer than is necessary for identification, although they may be permitted to remain in a lounge or other waiting area on the base at their request for such period as the installation commander may determine (normally not to exceed close of business hours at the home office of the entity owning the aircraft, if the operator does not own the aircraft). No person, solely due to an intentional unauthorized landing, will be detained involuntarily after identification is complete without coordination from the appropriate US Attorney, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, and HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        § 855.16   Parking and storage.

#### § § 855.16

        The time that an aircraft spends on an installation is at the discretion of the installation commander or a designated representative but should be linked to the purpose of use authorized. Parking and storage may be permitted on a nonexclusive, temporary, or intermittent basis, when compatible with military requirements. At those locations where there are Air Force aero clubs, parking and storage privileges may be permitted in the area designated for aero club use without regard for the purpose of use authorized, if consistent with aero club policies. Any such permission may be revoked upon notice, based on military needs and the installation commander's discretion.

        § 855.17   Fees for landing, parking, and storage.

#### § § 855.17

        (a) Landing, parking, and storage fees (Tables 3 and 4 to this part) are determined by aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW). All fees are normally due and collectible at the time of use of the Air Force airfield. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is used to deposit the fees with the base accounting and finance officer. In some instances, it may be necessary to bill the user for charges incurred.

        (b) Landing fees are not charged when the aircraft is operating in support of official Government business or for any purpose, the cost of which is subject to reimbursement by the US Government. Parking and Storage Fees (Table 4 to this part) are charged if an aircraft must remain beyond the period necessary to conduct official Government business and for all non-official Government business operations.

        § 855.18   Aviation fuel and oil purchases.

#### § § 855.18

        When a user qualifies under the provisions of AFM 67-1, vol. 1, part three, chapter 1, Air Force Stock Fund and DPSC Assigned Item Procedures,   purchase of Air Force fuel and oil may be made on a cash or credit basis. An application for credit authority can be filed by submitting an Authorized Credit Letter to SA-ALC/SFRL, 1014 Andrews Road, Building 1621, Kelly AFB TX 78241-5603.

        § 855.19   Supply and service charges.

#### § § 855.19

        Supplies and services furnished to a user will be charged for as prescribed in AFM 67-1, volume 1, part one, chapter 10, section N, Basic Air Force Supply Procedures, and AFR 177-102, paragraph 28.24, Commercial Transactions at Base Level.   A personal check with appropriate identification, cashier's check, money order, or cash are acceptable means of payment. Charges for handling foreign military sales cargo are prescribed in AFR 170-3, Financial Management and Accounting for Security Assistance and International Programs.

      Subpart C—Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields

        § 855.20   Joint-use agreements.

#### § § 855.20

        An agreement between the Air Force and a local Government agency is required before a community can establish a public airport on an Air Force airfield.

        (a) Joint use of an Air Force airfield will be considered only if there will be no cost to the Air Force and no compromise of mission capability, security, readiness, safety, or quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized representatives of local Government agencies eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint use agreement. All reviewing levels will consider and evaluate such requests on an individual basis.

        (b) Generally, the Air Force is willing to consider joint use at an airfield if it does not have pilot training, nuclear storage, or a primary mission that requires a high level of security. Civil operations must begin within 5 years of the effective date of an agreement. Operational considerations will be based on the premise that military aircraft will receive priority handling (except in emergencies), if traffic must be adjusted or resequenced. The Air Force normally will not consider personnel increases solely to support civil operations but, if accommodated, all costs must be fully reimbursed by the joint-use sponsor. The Air Force will not provide personnel to install, operate, maintain, alter, or relocate navigation equipment or aircraft arresting systems for the sole use of civil aviation. Changes in equipment or systems to support the civil operations must be funded by the joint-use sponsor. The Air Force must approve siting, design, and construction of the civil facilities.

        § 855.21   Procedures for sponsor.

#### § § 855.21

        To initiate consideration for joint use of an Air Force airfield, a formal proposal must be submitted to the installation commander by a local Government agency eligible to sponsor a public airport. The proposal must include:

        (a) Type of operation.

        (b) Type and number of aircraft to be located on or operating at the airfield.

        (c) An estimate of the number of annual operations for the first 5 years.

        § 855.22   Air Force procedures.

#### § § 855.22

        (a) Upon receipt of a joint-use proposal, the installation commander, without precommitment or comment, will send the documents to the Air Force Representative (AFREP) at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regional Office within the geographical area where the installation is located. AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management,   lists the AFREPs and their addresses. The installation commander must provide an information copy of the proposal to HQ USAF/XOOBC, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.

        (b) The AFREP provides comments to the installation commander on airspace, air traffic control, and other related areas, and informs local FAA personnel of the proposal for joint use.

        (c) The installation, the numbered Air Force, and the major command (MAJCOM) will then evaluate the proposal. The MAJCOM will send the comments and recommendations from all reviewing officials to HQ USAF/XOOBC.

        (d) Factors considered in evaluating joint use include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Impact on current and programmed military activities at the installation.

        (2) Compatibility of proposed civil aviation operations with present and planned military operations.

        (3) Compatibility of communications systems.

        (4) Instrument capability of crew and aircraft.

        (5) Runway and taxiway configuration. (Installations with single runways normally will not be considered for joint use.)

        (6) Security. The possibility for sabotage, terrorism, and vandalism increases with joint use; therefore, joint use will not be considered:

        (i) If military and civil aircraft would be collocated in hangars or on ramps.

        (ii) If access to the civil aviation facilities would require routine transit through the base.

        (7) Fire, crash, and rescue requirements.

        (8) Availability of public airports to accommodate the current and future air transportation needs of the community through construction or expansion.

        (9) Availability of land for civil airport complex.

        (10) Sponsor's resources to pay a proportionate share of costs for runway operation and maintenance and other jointly used facilities or otherwise provide compensation that is of direct benefit to the Government.

        (e) When the Air Force determines that joint use may be compatible with its defense mission, the environmental impact analysis process must be completed before a final decision can be made. The Air Force will act as lead agency for the preparation of the environmental analysis (32 CFR part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process). The local Government agency representatives, working in coordination with Air Force personnel at the installation and other concerned local or Federal officials, must identify the proposed action, develop conceptual alternatives, and provide planning, socioeconomic, and environmental information as specified by the appropriate MAJCOM and HQ USAF/CEVP. The information must be complete and accurate in order to serve as a basis for the preparation of the Air Force environmental documents. All costs associated with the environmental studies required to complete the environmental impact analysis process must be paid by the joint use sponsor. Information on environmental analysis requirements is available from HQ USAF/CEVP, 1260 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1260.

        (f) HQ USAF/XOOBC can begin negotiating a joint-use agreement after the environmental impact analysis process is completed. The agreement must be concluded on behalf of the Air Force by SAF/MII as the approval authority for use of Air Force real property for periods exceeding 5 years. The joint-use agreement will state the extent to which the provisions of subpart B of this part, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, apply to civil aircraft operations.

        (1) Joint-use agreements are tailored to accommodate the needs of the community and minimize the impact on the defense mission. Although each agreement is unique, attachment 4 to this part provides basic terms that are frequently included in such agreements.

        (2) Agreements for joint use at Air Force airfields on foreign soil are subject to the requirements of AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements  .

        (g) HQ USAF/XOOBC and SAF/MII approval is required to amend existing joint use agreements. The evaluation and decision processes followed in concluding an initial joint-use proposal must be used to amend existing joint-use agreements.

        § 855.23   Other agreements.

#### § § 855.23

        (a) Temporary use of Air Force runways occasionally is needed for extended periods when a local civil airport is unavailable or to accommodate special events or projects. Such use requires agreement between the Air Force and the local airport authority or other equivalent responsible entity.

        (b) The local proponent and Air Force personnel should draft and submit an agreement to the MAJCOM Director for Operations, or equivalent level, for review and comment. The agreement must address all responsibilities for handling aircraft, cargo, and passengers, and hold the Air Force harmless of all liabilities. The agreement will not exceed 3 years. Although each agreement will be unique, attachment 5 of this part provides one example. The draft agreement, with all comments and recommendations, must be sent to HQ USAF/XOOBC for final approval.

    PART 861—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORTATION QUALITY AND SAFETY REVIEW PROGRAM

### Part 861

**Authority:** Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2640, 8013.

**Source:** Source: 67 FR 65698, Oct. 28, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

      § 861.1   References.

#### § § 861.1

      The following references apply to this part:

      (a) 10 U.S.C. 2640, Charter Air Transportation of Members of the Armed Forces.

      (b) Department of Defense Directive 4500.53,

      § 861.2   Purpose.

#### § § 861.2

      Department of Defense Directive 4500.53,  charges the Commander-in-Chief (CINC), United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), with ensuring the establishment of safety requirements and criteria for evaluating civil air carriers and operators (hereinafter collectively referred to as “air carriers”) providing air transportation and operational support services to the Department of Defense (DOD). It also charges the CINC with ensuring the establishment of a Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB) and providing policy guidance and direction for its operation. This part establishes DOD quality and safety criteria for air carriers providing or seeking to provide air transportation and, at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, operational support services to the DOD. This part also includes the operating procedures of the CARB. The CARB has the authority to suspend air carriers from DOD use or take other actions when issues of air carrier quality and air safety arise.

      § 861.3   Definitions.

#### § § 861.3

      (a)  Individuals or entities that operate commercial fixed and rotary wing aircraft in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Chapter I) or equivalent regulations issued by a country's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and which provide air transportation or operational support services. Commercial air carriers under contract with, or operating on behalf of the DOD shall have a FAA or CAA certificate.

      (b)  The transport of DOD personnel or cargo by fixed or rotary wing commercial aircraft, where such services are acquired primarily for the transportation of DOD personnel and cargo, through donation or any form of contract, tender, blanket ordering agreement, Government charge card, Government or commercial transportation request (TR), bill of lading, or similar instruments. Air transportation services also include medical evacuation services, paratrooper drops, and charter airlift and group travel arranged by the Military Service Academies, foreign military sales, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities by other DOD and non-DOD activities for DOD personnel. All air carriers providing air transportation services to DOD must have a FAA or CAA certificate. The policy contained in this Directive shall not apply to individually procured, discretionary air travel, such as that associated with military leave or pass.

      (c)  The CAA refers to the organization within a country that has the authority and responsibility to regulate civil aviation. The term CAA is used throughout this part since these requirements are applicable to both U.S. and foreign carriers doing business with DOD. The term CAA thus includes the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

      (d)  Code sharing is a marketing arrangement in which an air carrier places its designator code on a flight operated by another air carrier and sells tickets for that flight.

      (e)  DOD approval in the context of this part refers to the process by which air carriers seeking to provide passenger or cargo airlift services (hereinafter referred to as air transportation services) to the DOD must be screened and evaluated by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office or other entity authorized by the CARB, and approved for DOD use by the CARB. Once initial approval is obtained, a DOD approved air carrier must remain in an approved status to be eligible for DOD business. Although not generally required, the CARB or higher authority may, on a case-by-case basis, require DOD approval of air carriers providing operational support services to DOD.

      (f)  Includes four possible levels of review with increasing authority. The responsibilities of each are described in more detail in the reference in § 861.1 (b). These levels consist of the:

      (1) DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office;

      (2) DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB);

      (3) Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Transportation Command, or USCINCTRANS; and

      (4) Secretary of Defense. ( A DOD-level body, the Commercial Airlift Review Authority, or CARA, provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.)

      (g)  The FAA IASA program assesses the ability of a foreign country's CAA to adhere to international standards established by the United Nation's technical agency for aviation, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The FAA has established ratings for the status of countries as follows:

      (1)  A country's CAA has been found to license and oversee air carriers in accordance with ICAO aviation safety standards.

      (2)  A country's CAA does not meet ICAO standards for aviation oversight. Operations to the U.S. by a carrier from a Category 2 country are limited to those in effect at the time a country is classified as Category 2 and are subjected to heightened FAA surveillance. Expansion or changes in services to the U.S. are not permitted while a country is in Category 2 status unless the carrier arranges to have new services conducted by an air carrier from a Category 1 country. Category 2 countries that do not have operations to the U.S. at the time of the FAA assessment are not permitted to commence such operations unless it arranges to have its flights conducted by an air carrier from a Category 1 country.

      (3)  A country's CAA is labeled “non-rated” if it has not been assessed by the FAA.

      (h)  A program managed by the General Services Administration in which U.S. air carriers compete for annual contracts awarding U.S. Government business for specific domestic and international scheduled service city pair routes.

      (i)  Twenty-one or more passengers on orders from the same organization traveling on the same date to the same destination to attend the same function.

      (j)  A notice to a DOD approved air carrier of a failure to satisfy safety or airworthiness requirements which, if not remedied, may result in temporary nonuse or suspension of the air carrier by the DOD. Issuance of a  is not a prerequisite to a suspension or other action by the CARB or higher DOD authority.

      (k)  The most comprehensive evaluation performed by DOD's Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office. Successful completion of this evaluation is required of most air carriers before they may be approved to provide air transportation services to DOD. Once approved, air carriers are subject to periodic On-site Capability Surveys, as specified at Enclosure 3 in the reference in § 861.1(b).

      (l)  Missions performed by air carriers that use fixed or rotary-winged aircraft to provide services other than air transportation services as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Examples include, but are not limited to, range instrumentation and services, target-towing, sling loads, and electronic countermeasures target flights. Air carriers providing only operational support services do not require advance DOD approval and are not subject to the initial or periodic on-site survey requirements under this part, unless directed by the CARB or higher authority. All air carriers providing operational support services to DOD must have a FAA or CAA certificate and are required to maintain applicable FAA or CAA standards absent deviation authority obtained pursuant to 14 CFR 119.55 or similar CAA rules.

      (m)  Reviews conducted by U.S. air carriers when evaluating foreign air carriers with which they have code share arrangements, using performance-based factors. Such assessments include reviewing a variety of air carrier data including history, safety, scope/size, financial condition, equipment, flight operations and airworthiness issues.

      (n)  Reviews conducted by DOD as directed in the references in § 861.1(a) and (b). These evaluations include a review of air carrier flight operations, maintenance departments, safety programs and other air carrier areas as necessary. Performance evaluations are not conducted on-site, but rely on information collected primarily from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

      (o)  A visual safety inspection of the interior and exterior of an air carrier's aircraft performed by DOD personnel in accordance with the references in § 861.1(a) and (b).

      (p)  The exclusion of an air carrier from providing services to the DOD. The period of suspension will normally:

      (1) Remain in effect until the air carrier furnishes satisfactory evidence that the conditions causing the suspension have been remedied and has been reinstated by the CARB, or;

      (2) Be for a fixed period of time as determined at the discretion of the CARB.

      (q)  The immediate exclusion of a DOD approved air carrier from providing services to the DOD pending a decision on suspension. Normally, temporary nonuse will be for a period of 30 days or less. However, by mutual agreement of the CARB and the air carrier involved, a suspension hearing or decision may be delayed and the air carrier continued in a temporary nonuse status for an extended period of time.

      (r)  Information which consists of nonfactual safety-related data, reports, statements, and other information provided to DOD by an air carrier at any point in the evaluation process described in this Part. It does not include factual safety-related information, such as statistics, maintenance reports, training records, flight planning information, and the like.

      § 861.4   DOD air transportation quality and safety requirements.

#### § § 861.4

      (a)  The DOD, as a customer of air transportation and operational support services, expects air carriers used by DOD to employ programs and business practices that not only ensure good service but also enhance the safety, operational, and maintenance standards established by applicable Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations. Accordingly, and as required by the references in § 861.1 (a) and (b), the DOD has established a set of quality and safety criteria and requirements that reflect the type programs and practices DOD seeks from air carriers providing services to DOD. Air carriers must meet and maintain these requirements in order to be eligible for DOD business. Air carriers providing air transportation services to DOD either directly by contract or agreement, or indirectly through the General Services Administration (GSA) City Pair Program or some other arrangement, must be approved by DOD prior to providing such services and remain in an approved status throughout the contract, agreement, or arrangement performance period. This approval entails successful completion of initial and recurring on-site surveys as well as periodic performance evaluations in accordance with the reference in § 861.1(b). The quality and safety criteria and requirements set forth in this part complement rather than replace the CAA criteria applicable to air carriers. Air carriers normally remain fully subject to applicable CAA regulations (CARs) while performing business for the DOD, even when the aircraft involved is used exclusively for DOD missions. The inspection and oversight criteria set forth in this part do not, as a general rule, apply to air carriers providing only operational support services to DOD. However, in the event concerns relating to the safety of such a carrier arise, the CARB or higher authority may, on a case-by-case basis, direct an appropriate level of oversight under the authority of this part.

      (b)  (1) The evaluation, quality and safety criteria and requirements set forth in this part apply to air carriers providing or seeking to provide air transportation services to DOD.

      (2) Foreign air carriers performing portions of GSA City Pair routes awarded to U.S. air carriers under a code-sharing arrangement, as well as foreign air carriers providing individually-ticketed passenger service to DOD personnel traveling on official business, may be subject to limited oversight and review pursuant to § 861.6.

      (3) The inspection and oversight requirements, as well as the quality and safety criteria of this part may, on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, be applied to air carriers seeking to provide or providing operational support services as defined in § 861.3(l).

      (4) The inspection and oversight requirements of this part do not apply to aircraft engaged in medical transport services if procured under emergency conditions to save life, limb or eyesight. Likewise, the inspection and oversight requirements of this part are not applicable when DOD is not involved in the procurement of the medical transportation services. For example, when specific medical treatment is obtained on an individual basis by or for DOD personnel with medical transportation provided, as needed, at the direction of the non-DOD medical care giver. This includes situations where DOD, through TRICARE or otherwise, pays for such transportation as part of the costs of medical services provided.

      (c) —(1)  The provision of air transportation services under a contract or agreement with or on behalf of DOD, requires the successful completion of an initial on-site survey and approval by the CARB under this part in order to be eligible for DOD business. In addition, U.S. air carriers awarded contracts under the GSA City Pair Program, including those that perform part of the contract under a code-sharing arrangement with the U.S. air carrier awarded the contract, must successfully complete an initial on-site survey and be approved by the CARB for DOD use under this part prior to beginning performance of the GSA contract. Once approved by DOD, air carriers providing air transportation services are subject to recurring on-site surveys and performance evaluations and assessments throughout the duration of the relevant contract or agreement. The frequency and scope of these surveys and performance reviews will be in accordance with Enclosure 3 of the reference in § 861.1(b).

      (2)  Evaluations are performed by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office located at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The mailing address of this office is HQ AMC/DOB, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL 62225-5302. The website address is

      (3)  The specifics of the applicable DOD contract or agreement (if any), the applicable CAA regulations, and the experienced judgment of DOD personnel will be used to evaluate an air carrier's capability to perform services for DOD. The survey may also include, with the air carrier's coordination, observation of cockpit crew performance, as well as ramp inspections of selected company aircraft. In the case of air carriers seeking to provide air transportation services, after satisfactory completion of the initial survey and approval by the CARB as a DOD air carrier, follow-up surveys will be conducted on a recurring basis and when otherwise required to validate adherence to DOD quality and safety requirements. DOD personnel will also assess these quality and safety requirements when conducting periodic air carrier performance evaluations. The size of an air carrier, along with the type and scope of operations will be considered during the on-site survey. For example, while an air taxi operator may not have a formal flight control function, such as a 24-hour dispatch organization, that same air taxi operator is expected to demonstrate some type of effective flight following capability. On the other hand, a major air carrier is expected to have a formal flight control or dispatch function. Both, however, will be evaluated based on the effectiveness and quality of whatever flight following function they do maintain. In the case of air carriers seeking to provide operational support services, the type, scope and frequency of evaluation, if any, performed by DOD or other entity will be as directed by the CARB or higher authority.

      (d)  All air carriers providing air transportation or operational support services to the DOD shall have FAA or CAA air carrier or commercial operator certificates and shall remain under FAA and/or CAA regulatory and safety oversight during performance of the DOD mission. Aircraft performing services for or on behalf of DOD shall be on the air carrier's operating certificate, and remain on that certificate while performing the DOD mission. The installation of any special equipment needed to perform services for DOD shall be FAA or CAA approved or an appropriate FAA or CAA waiver obtained.

      (e)  The air carrier requirements stated in this part provide the criteria against which would-be DOD and GSA City Pair Program air carrier contractors, as well as air carriers providing services on behalf of DOD, may be subjectively evaluated by DOD. These requirements are neither all-inclusive nor inflexible in nature. They are not replacements for the certification criteria and other regulations established by the CAA. Rather, these requirements complement CAA certification criteria and regulations and describe the enhanced level of service required by DOD. The relative weight accorded these requirements in a given case, as well as the determination of whether an air carrier meets or exceeds them, is a matter within the sole discretion of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office and the CARB, subject to the statutory minimums provided in the reference in § 861.1(a).

      (1)  U.S. and foreign air carriers applying for DOD approval in order to conduct air transportation services for or on behalf of DOD under a contract or agreement with DOD, the GSA City Pair Program, or by some other arrangement are required to possess 12 months of continuous service equivalent to the service sought by DOD. In applying this requirement, the following guidance will be used by DOD authorities:

      (i) “12 months” refers to the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the request for DOD approval.

      (ii) “Continuous” service means the carrier must have performed revenue-generating services of the nature for which DOD approval is sought, as an FAA part 121, 125, 127, or 135 (14 CFR 121, 125, 127, or 135) air carrier (or foreign CAA equivalent if appropriate) on a recurring, substantially uninterrupted basis. The services must have occurred with such frequency and regularity as to clearly demonstrate the carrier's ability to perform and support sustained, safe, reliable, and regular services of the type DOD is seeking. Weekly flight activity is normally considered continuous, while sporadic or seasonal operations (if such operations are the only operations conducted by the carrier) may not suffice to establish a carrier's ability to perform and support services in the sustained, safe, reliable, and regular manner required by DOD. The ability of a carrier to perform services of the type sought by DOD may be called into question if there have been lengthy periods of time during the qualifying period in which the carrier has not operated such services. Consequently, any cessation, or nonperformance of the type of service for which approval is sought may, if it exceeds 30 days in length during the qualifying period and depending on the underlying factual circumstances, necessitate “restarting” the 12-month continuous service period needed to obtain DOD approval.

      (iii) “Equivalent to the services sought by DOD” means service offered to qualify for DOD approval must be substantially equivalent to the type of service sought by DOD. The prior experience must be equivalent in difficulty and complexity with regard to the distances flown, weather systems encountered, international and national procedures, the same or similar aircraft, schedule demands, aircrew experience, number of passengers handled, frequency of operations, and management required. There is not a set formula for determining whether a particular type of service qualifies. The performance of cargo services is not considered to be “substantially equivalent” to the performance of passenger services, and may not be used to meet the 12 continuous months requirement for passenger services. However, when a carrier already providing cargo services to DOD applies to carry passengers, the CARB may consider the carrier's cargo performance and experience in assessing whether a carrier is qualified to carry passengers on a specific type or category of aircraft, over certain routes or stage lengths, or under differing air traffic control, weather, or other conditions. The following examples are illustrative and not intended to reflect or predict CARB action in any given case:

      (iv) Once approved by DOD, an air carrier's failure to maintain continuous operations of the type for which approval has been granted may, at the discretion of the CARB, be grounds for nonuse or suspension under this part, rendering the carrier ineligible for DOD business during the nonuse or suspension period. Any cessation or nonperformance of the type of service for which approval has been obtained may, if it exceeds 30 days in length and depending on the circumstances, provide the basis for the CARB to take appropriate action.

      (2)  Management has clearly defined safety as the number one company priority, and safety is never sacrificed to satisfy passenger concern, convenience, or cost. Policies, procedures, and goals that enhance the CAA's minimum operations and maintenance standards have been established and implemented. A cooperative response to CAA inspections, critiques, or comments is demonstrated. Proper support infrastructure, including facilities, equipment, parts, and qualified personnel, is provided at the certificate holder's primary facility and en route stations. Personnel with aviation credentials and experience fill key management positions. An internal quality audit program or other method capable of identifying in-house deficiencies and measuring the company's compliance with their stated policies and standards has been implemented. Audit results are analyzed in order to determine the cause, not just the symptom, of any deficiency. The result of sound fiscal policy is evident throughout the company. Foreign code-sharing air carrier partners are audited at least every two years using DOD-approved criteria and any findings resolved. Comprehensive disaster response plans and, where applicable, family support plans, must be in place and exercised on a regular basis.

      (3) —(i)  Established policies that promote flight safety. These policies are infused among all aircrew and operational personnel who translate the policies into practice. New or revised safety-related data are promptly disseminated to affected personnel who understand that deviation from any established safety policy is unacceptable. An audit system that detects unsafe practices is in place and a feedback structure informs management of safety policy results including possible safety problems. Management ensures that corrective actions resolve every unsafe condition.

      (ii)  Established flight operations policies and procedures are up-to-date, reflect the current scope of operations, and are clearly defined to aviation department employees. These adhered-to procedures are further supported by a flow of current, management-generated safety and operational communications. Managers are in touch with mission requirements, supervise crew selection, and ensure the risk associated with all flight operations is reduced to the lowest acceptable level. Flight crews are free from undue management pressure and are comfortable with exercising their professional judgment during flight activities, even if such actions do not support the flight schedule. Effective lines of communication permit feedback from line crews to operations managers. Personnel records are maintained and reflect such data as experience, qualifications, and medical status.

      (iii)  Established procedures ensure that applicants are carefully screened, including a review of the individual's health and suitability to perform flight crew duties. Consideration is given to the applicant's total aviation background, appropriate experience, and the individual's potential to perform safely. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is required. If new-hire cockpit crewmembers do not meet industry standards for experience and qualification, then increased training and management attention to properly qualify these personnel are required.

      (iv)  Training, including recurrent training, which develops and refines skills designed to eliminate mishaps and improve safety, is essential to a quality operation. Crew coordination training that facilitates full cockpit crews training and full crew interaction using standardized procedures and including the principles of Crew Resource Management (CRM) is required. Programs involving the use of simulators or other devices that can provide realistic training scenarios are desired. Captain and First Officer training objectives cultivate similar levels of proficiency. Appropriate emergency procedures training ( evacuation procedures) is provided to flight deck and flight attendant personnel as a total crew whenever possible; such training focuses on cockpit and cabin crews functioning as a coordinated team during emergencies. Crew training—be it pilot, engineer, or flight attendant—is appropriate to the level of risk and circumstances anticipated for the trainee. Training programs have the flexibility to incorporate and resolve recurring problem areas associated with day-to-day flight operations. Aeromedical crews must also be trained in handling the specific needs of the categories of patients normally accepted for transportation on the equipment to be used. Trainers are highly skilled in both subject matter and training techniques. Training received is documented, and that documentation is maintained in a current status.

      (v)  A selection and training process that considers proven experience, decision making, crew resource management, and response to unusual situations, including stress and pressure, is required. Also important is emphasis on captain responsibility and authority.

      (vi)  A closely monitored system that evaluates operational risks, experience levels of crewmembers, and ensures the proper pairing of aircrews on all flights is required. New captains are scheduled with highly experienced first officers, and new or low-time first officers are scheduled with experienced captains. Except for aircraft new to the company, captains and first officers assigned to DOD charter passenger missions possess at least 250 hours combined experience in the type aircraft being operated. The scheduling system involves an established flight duty time program for aircrews, including flight attendants, carefully managed so as to ensure proper crew rest and considers quality-of-life factors. Attention is given to the stress on aircrews during strikes, mergers, or periods of labor-management difficulties.

      (vii)  Aircrews, including flight attendants and flight medical personnel, are fit for flight duties and trained to handle normal, abnormal, and emergency situations. They demonstrate crew discipline and a knowledge of aviation rules; use company-developed standardized procedures; adhere to checklists; and emphasize safety, including security considerations, throughout all preflight, in-flight, and postflight operations. Qualified company personnel evaluate aircrews and analyze results; known performance deficiencies are eliminated. Evaluations ensure aircrews demonstrate aircraft proficiency in accordance with company established standards. Flight crews are able to determine an aircraft's maintenance condition prior to flight and use standardized methods to accurately report aircraft deficiencies to the maintenance activity.

      (viii)  Effective mission control includes communications with aircrews and the capability to respond to irregularities or difficulties. Clear written procedures for mission preparation and flight following aircraft and aircrews are provided. There is access to weather, flight planning, and aircraft maintenance data. There are personnel available who are knowledgeable in aircraft performance and mission requirements and that can correctly respond to emergency situations. There is close interface between operations and maintenance, ensuring a mutual awareness of aircraft operational and maintenance status. Procedures to notify DOD in case of an accident or serious incident have been established. Flight crews involved in such accidents or incidents report the situation to company personnel who, in turn, have procedures to evaluate the flight crew's capability to continue the mission. Aircraft involved in accidents or incidents are inspected in accordance with Civil Aviation Regulations and a determination made as to whether or not the aircraft is safe for continued operations.

      (ix)  Detailed procedures addressing military charter requirements are expected. The level of risk associated with DOD charter missions does not exceed the risks inherent in the carrier's non-DOD daily flight operations. Complete route planning and airport analyses are accomplished, and actual passenger and cargo weights are used in computing aircraft weight and balance.

      (4)  Maintenance supervisors ensure all personnel understand that in spite of scheduling pressure, peer pressure, supervisory pressure, or other factors, the airplane must be airworthy prior to flight. Passenger and employee safety is a paramount management concern. Quality, completeness, and integrity of work are trademarks of the maintenance manager and maintenance department. Nonconformance to established maintenance practices is not tolerated. Management ensures that contracted maintenance, including repair and overhaul facilities, is performed by maintenance organizations acceptable to the CAA.

      (i)  Air carriers are expected to hire and train the number of employees required to safely maintain the company aircraft and support the scope of the maintenance operations both at home station (the company's primary facility) and at en route locations. These personnel ensure that all maintenance tasks, including required inspections and airworthiness directives, are performed; that maintenance actions are properly documented; and that the discrepancies identified between inspections are corrected. Mechanics are fit for duty, properly certificated, the company verifies certification, and these personnel possess the knowledge and the necessary aircraft-specific experience to accomplish the maintenance tasks. Noncertified and inexperienced personnel received proper supervision. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is required.

      (ii)  A system that continuously analyzes the performance and effectiveness of maintenance activities and maintenance inspection programs is required. This system evaluates such functions as reliability reports, audits, component tear-down reports, inspection procedures and results, tool calibration program, real-time aircraft maintenance actions, warranty programs, and other maintenance functions. The extent of this program is directly related to the air carrier's size and scope of operation. The cause of any recurring discrepancy or negative trend is researched and eliminated. Action is taken to prevent recurrence of these discrepancies and preventive actions are monitored to ensure effectiveness. The results of preventive actions are provided to appropriate maintenance technicians.

      (iii)  A process to ensure required aircraft inspections are completed and the results properly documented is required. Also required is a system to evaluate contract vendors, suppliers, and their products. Inspection personnel are identified, trained (initial and recurrent), and provided guidance regarding inspector responsibility and authority. The inspection activity is normally a separate entity within the maintenance department.

      (iv)  Training is conducted commensurate with the size and type of maintenance function being performed. Continuing education and progressive experience are provided for all maintenance personnel. Orientation, familiarization, on-the-job, and appropriate recurrent training for all full and part-time personnel are expected. The use of such training aids as mockups, simulators, and computer-based training enhances maintenance training efforts and is desired. Training documentation is required; it is current, complete, well maintained, and correctly identifies any special authorization such as inspection and airworthiness release. Trainers are fully qualified in the subject manner.

      (v)  A method to control maintenance activities and track aircraft status is required. Qualified personnel monitor maintenance preplanning, ensure completion of maintenance actions, and track deferred discrepancies. Deferred maintenance actions are identified to supervisory personnel and corrected in accordance with the criteria provided by the manufacturer or regulatory agency. Constant and effective communications between maintenance and flight operations ensure an exchange of critical information.

      (vi)  Aircraft are properly certified and maintained in a manner that ensures they are airworthy and safe. The program includes the use of manufacturer's and CAA information, as well as company policies and procedures. Airworthiness directives are complied with in the prescribed time frame, and service bulletins are evaluated for applicable action. Approved reliability programs are proactive, providing management with visibly on the effectiveness of the maintenance program; attention is given to initial component and older aircraft inspection intervals and to deferred maintenance actions. Special tools and equipment are calibrated.

      (vii)  Maintenance actions are well documented and provide a complete record of maintenance accomplished and, for repetitive actions, maintenance required. Such records as aircraft log books and maintenance documentation are legible, dated, clean, readily identifiable, and maintained in an orderly fashion. Inspection compliance, airworthiness release, and maintenance release records, etc., are completed and signed by approved personnel.

      (viii)  Aircraft exteriors, including all visible surfaces and components, are clean and well maintained. Interiors are also clean and orderly. Required safety equipment and systems are available and operable.

      (ix)  Aircraft fuel is free from contamination, and company fuel facilities (farms) are inspected and results documented. Procedures and instructions pertaining to servicing, handling, and storing fuel and oil meet established safety standards. Procedures for monitoring and verifying vendor servicing practices are included in this program.

      (x)  Company policy manuals and manufacturer's maintenance manuals are current, available, clear, complete, and adhered to by maintenance personnel. These manuals provide maintenance personnel with standardized procedures for maintaining company aircraft. Management policies, lines of authority, and company maintenance procedures are documented in company manuals and kept in a current status.

      (xi)  Well maintained, clean maintenance facilities, adequate for the level of aircraft repair authorized in the company's CAA certificate are expected. Safety equipment is available in hangars, shops, etc., and is serviceable. Shipping, receiving, and stores areas are likewise clean and orderly. Parts are correctly packaged, tagged, segregated, and shelf life properly monitored.

      (5)  Company personnel receive training in security responsibilities and practice applicable procedures during ground and in-flight operations. Compliance with provisions of the appropriate standard security program, established by the Transportation Security Administration or foreign equivalent, is required for all DOD missions.

      (6)  Air carriers satisfy DOD equipment and other requirements as specified in DOD agreements.

      (7)  Air carriers awarded a route under the Passenger Standing Route Order (PSRO) program, the GSA City Pair Program, or other DOD program, that includes performance of a portion of the route by a commuter or foreign air carrier with which it has a code-sharing arrangement, must have a formal procedure in place to periodically review and assess the code-sharing air carrier's safety, operations, and maintenance programs. The extent of such reviews and assessments must be consistent with, and related to, the code-sharing air carrier's safety history. These procedures must also provide for actual inspections of the foreign code-sharing air carrier if the above reviews and assessments indicate questionable safety practices.

      (8)  (i) The degree of oversight is as determined by the CARB or higher authority. When an inspection is conducted, DOD medical personnel may also participate to assess the ability to provide the patient care and any specialty care required by DOD. The CARB's review will be limited solely to issues related to flight safety.

      (ii) Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) used in the provision of medical services or treatment on board aircraft are tested for non-interference with aircraft systems and the results documented to show compliance with 14 CFR 91.21 or other applicable CAA regulations. If there are no CAA regulations, actual use/inflight testing of the same or similar model PED prior to use with DOD patients is the minimum requirement.

      § 861.5   DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board procedures.

#### § § 861.5

      (a) This section establishes procedures to be used by the DOD when, in accordance with references in§ 861.1(a) and (b):

      (1) An air carrier is subject to review or other action by the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board, or CARB;

      (2) A warning, suspension, temporary nonuse, or reinstatement action is considered or taken against a carrier by the CARB; or

      (3) An issue involving an air carrier is referred by the CARB to higher authority for appropriate action.

      (b) These procedures apply to air carriers seeking to provide or already providing air transportation services to DOD. It also applies to U.S. or foreign air carriers providing operational support services to DOD which, on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, require some level of oversight by DOD.

      (c) An air carrier's sole remedy in the case of a suspension decision by the CARB is the appellate process under this part.

      (d) Quality and safety issues relating to air carriers used, or proposing to be used, by DOD, per reference (b) must be referred to the CARB for appropriate disposition.

      (e)  As detailed in the reference in § 861.1(b), the CARB provides a multifunctional review of the efforts of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office and is the first level decision authority in DOD on quality and safety issues relating to air carriers. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers seeking initial approval to provide air transportation service to DOD; the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers in the program that do not meet DOD quality and safety requirements; the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers in the program seeking to provide a class of service different from that which they are currently approved; taking action to suspend, reinstate, or place into temporary nonuse or extended temporary nonuse, DOD approved carriers; taking action, on an as needed basis, to review, suspend, reinstate, or place into temporary nonuse or extended temporary nonuse, an air carrier providing operational support services to DOD; and, referring with recommendations, issues requiring resolution or other action by higher authority.

      (f) —(1)  The CARB will consist of four voting members appointed by USCINCTRANS from USTRANSCOM and its component commands. These members and their alternates will be general officers or their civilian equivalent, with experience in the operations, maintenance, transportation, or air safety fields. A Chairman and alternate will be designated. Nonvoting CARB members will be appointed as necessary by USCINCTRANS. A non-voting recorder will also be appointed.

      (2)  Decisions of the CARB will be taken by a majority vote of the voting members present, with a minimum of three voting members (or their alternates) required to constitute a quorum. In the event of a tie, the Chair of the CARB will decide the issue.

      (3)  The CARB may meet either in person or by some electronic means. It will be convened by either USCINCTRANS or the Chair of the CARB. The meeting date, time, and site of the CARB will be determined at the time of the decision to convene the CARB. Minutes of CARB meetings will be taken by the recorder, summarized, and preserved with all other records relating to the CARB meeting. The recorder will ensure the air carrier and appropriate DOD and federal agencies are notified of the CARB's decision(s) and reasons therefore. In the event of a fatal accident, the CARB shall convene as soon as possible but not later than 72 hours after notification by the Chair.

      (g) —(1)  (i) In case of a fatal aircraft accident or for other good cause, two or more voting members of the CARB may jointly make an immediate determination whether to place the air carrier involved into a temporary nonuse status pending suspension proceedings. Prior notice to the air carrier is not required.

      (ii) The carrier shall be promptly notified of the temporary nonuse determination and the basis therefore.

      (iii) Temporary nonuse status terminates automatically if suspension proceedings are not commenced, as set out in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, within 30 days of inception unless the CARB and air carrier mutually agree to extend the temporary nonuse status.

      (2)  (i) On a recommendation of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office or any individual voting member of the CARB, the CARB shall consider whether or not to suspend a DOD approved air carrier.

      (ii) If the CARB determines that suspension may be appropriate, it shall notify the air carrier that suspension action is under consideration and of the basis for such consideration. The air carrier will be offered a hearing within 15 days of the date of the notice, or other such period as granted by the CARB, at which the air carrier may be present and may offer evidence. The hearings shall be as informal as practicable, consistent with administrative due process. Formal rules of evidence do not apply.

      (iii) The types of evidence which may be considered includes, but is not limited to:

      (A) Information and analysis provided by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office.

      (B) Information submitted by the air carrier.

      (C) Information relating to action that may have been taken by the air carrier to:

      () Correct the specific deficiencies that led the CARB to consider suspension; and

      () Preclude recurring similar deficiencies.

      (D) Other matters the CARB deems relevant.

      (iv) The CARB's decisions on the reception or exclusion of evidence shall be final.

      (v) Air carriers shall have the burden of proving their suitability to safely perform DOD air transportation and/or operational support services by clear and convincing evidence.

      (vi) After the conclusion of such hearing, or if no hearing is requested and attended by the air carrier within the time specified by the CARB, the CARB shall consider the matter and make a final decision whether or not to suspend the air carrier or to impose such lesser sanctions as appropriate. The air carrier will be notified of the CARB's decision.

      (3)  (i) The CARB may consider reinstating a suspended carrier on either CARB motion or carrier motion, unless such carrier has become ineligible in the interim.

      (ii) The carrier has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that reinstatement is warranted. The air carrier must satisfy the CARB that the deficiencies, which led to suspension, have been corrected and that action has been implemented to preclude the recurrence of similar deficiencies.

      (iii) Air carrier evidence in support of reinstatement will be provided in a timely manner to the CARB for its review. The CARB may independently corroborate the carrier-provided evidence and may, at its option, convene a hearing and request the participation of the air carrier.

      (4)  (i) An air carrier placed in suspension by the CARB may administratively appeal this action to USCINCTRANS. An appeal, if any, must be filed in writing, with the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office, and postmarked within 15 workdays of receipt of notice of the CARB's suspension decision. In the sole discretion of USCINCTRANS, and for good cause shown, the suspension may be stayed pending action on the appeal.

      (ii) Air carriers shall not be entitled to a de novo hearing or personal presentation before the appellate authority.

      (iii) The decision of the appellate authority is final and is not subject to further administrative review or appeal.

      (5)  The approval or disapproval of an air carrier for use by DOD, the placing of approved carriers into temporary nonuse status, and the suspension and reinstatement of approved carriers, are all decisions which must be made by the CARB. Other matters may be referred by the CARB to USCINCTRANS for appropriate action, with or without recommendations by the CARB. The CARB will forward for decision, through USCINCTRANS to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)), all air carrier use/nonuse recommendations involving foreign air carriers other than those providing charter transportation or operational support service to the Department of Defense.

      § 861.6   DOD review of foreign air carriers.

#### § § 861.6

      Foreign air carriers providing or seeking to provide services to DOD shall be subject to review and, if appropriate, approval by DOD. Application of the criteria and requirements of this part and the degree of oversight to be exercised by DOD, if any, over a foreign air carrier depends upon the type of services performed and, in some instances, by the quality of oversight exercised by the foreign air carrier's CAA. The scope and frequency of the review of any given foreign air carrier under this part will be at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority.

      (a)  Foreign air carriers seeking to provide or providing air transportation services under a contract or Military Air Transportation Agreement with DOD, must meet all requirements of § 861.4, and be approved by the CARB in accordance with § 861.5. This includes foreign air carriers seeking to provide, or providing, airlift services to DOD personnel pursuant to an arrangement entered into by another federal agency, state agency, foreign government, international organization, or other entity or person on behalf of, or for the benefit of, DOD, regardless of whether DOD pays for the airlift services provided. For purposes of establishing the degree of oversight and review to be conducted under the DOD Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety Review Program, such foreign air carriers are considered the same as U.S. carriers. In addition, they must have an operating certificate issued by the appropriate CAA using regulations which are the substantial equivalent of those found in the U.S. FARs, and must maintain such certification throughout the term of the contract or agreement. The CAA responsible for exercising oversight of the foreign air carrier must meet ICAO standards as determined by ICAO, or the FAA under the FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment Program.

      (b)  Foreign air carriers performing any portion of a route awarded to a U.S. air carrier under the GSA City Pair Program pursuant to a code-sharing agreement with that U.S. air carrier, are generally not subject to DOD survey and approval under §§ 861.4 and 861.5. However, DOD will periodically review the performance of such foreign carriers. This review may consist of recurring performance evaluations, periodic examination of the U.S. code-sharing carrier's operational reviews and assessments of the foreign carrier and, where appropriate and agreed to by the air carriers concerned and DOD, on-site surveys of the foreign air carrier. Such carriers must also meet the 12 months prior experience requirement of § 861.4(e)(1). The CARB or higher authority may prescribe additional review requirements. Should circumstances warrant, use of these air carriers by DOD passengers on official business may be restricted or prohibited as necessary to assure the highest levels of passenger safety.

      (c)  Foreign air carriers carrying individually ticketed DOD passengers on official business are not subject to DOD survey and approval under §§ 861.4 and 861.5. However, the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Division may periodically review the performance of such carriers. Reviews may include voluntary on-site surveys as directed by the CARB or higher authority. In the event questions relating to the safety and continued use of the carrier arise, the matter may be referred to the CARB for appropriate action.

      (d)  Unless otherwise authorized, use by DOD personnel on official business of foreign air carriers from countries in which the CAA is not in compliance with ICAO standards is prohibited except for the last leg into and the first leg out of the U.S. on such carriers. This includes foreign air carriers performing any portion of a route awarded to a U.S. air carrier under the GSA City Pair Program pursuant to a code-sharing agreement with that U.S. air carrier.

      (e)  The scope of the on-site survey of a foreign air carrier will be at the discretion of the CARB. In the event a foreign air carrier denies a request made under this part to conduct an on-site survey, the CARB will consider all available information and make a use/nonuse recommendation to DOD. If placed in nonuse status by DOD, such air carriers will not be used unless, in accordance with the reference in § 861.1 (b), in the judgment of the appropriate Combatant Commander, no acceptable alternative to using the carrier exists and the travel is mission essential.

#### § § 861.7

      (a)  In accordance with paragraph (h) of the reference in § 861.1 (a), DOD may withhold from public disclosure safety-related information voluntarily provided to DOD by an air carrier for the purposes of this part if DOD determines that—

      (1) The disclosure of the information would, in the future, inhibit an air carrier from voluntarily providing such information to DOD or another Federal agency for the purposes of this part or for other air safety purposes; and

      (2) The receipt of such information generally enhances the fulfillment of responsibilities under this part or other air safety responsibilities involving DOD or another Federal agency.

      (b)  Requests for public disclosure will be administratively processed in accordance with 32 CFR part 806, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program.

      (c)  The Department of Defense may, at its discretion, disclose voluntarily provided safety-related information submitted under this part by an air carrier, to other agencies with safety responsibilities. The DOD will provide such information to another agency only upon receipt of adequate assurances that it will protect the information from public disclosure, and that it will not release such information unless specifically authorized.

      Subpart A—Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 59613, Sept. 28, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

        § 865.0   Purpose.

#### § § 865.0

        This subpart sets up procedures for correction of military records to remedy error or injustice. It tells how to apply for correction of military records and how the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR, or the Board) considers applications. It defines the Board's authority to act on applications. It directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1034 and 1552. System of Records notice F035 SAFCB A, Military Records Processed by the Air Force Correction Board, applies.

        § 865.1   Setup of the Board.

#### § § 865.1

        The AFBCMR operates within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force according to 10 U.S.C. 1552. The Board consists of civilians in the executive part of the Department of the Air Force who are appointed and serve at the pleasure of the Secretary of the Air Force. Three members constitute a quorum of the Board.

        § 865.2   Board responsibilities.

#### § § 865.2

        (a)  The Board considers all individual applications properly brought before it. In appropriate cases, it directs correction of military records to remove an error or injustice, or recommends such correction.

        (b)  When an applicant alleges reprisal under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. 1034, the Board may recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against those responsible for the reprisal.

        (c)  The Board normally decides cases on the evidence of the record. It is not an investigative body. However, the Board may, in its discretion, hold a hearing or call for additional evidence or opinions in any case.

        § 865.3   Application procedures.

#### § § 865.3

        (a) Who may apply:

        (1) In most cases, the applicant is a member or former member of the Air Force, since the request is personal to the applicant and relates to his or her military records.

        (2) An applicant with a proper interest may request correction of another person's military records when that person is incapable of acting on his or her own behalf, is missing, or is deceased. Depending on the circumstances, a child, spouse, civilian employee or former civilian employee, former spouse, parent or other close relative, an heir, or a legal representative (such as a guardian or executor) of the member or former member may be able to show a proper interest. Applicants will send proof of proper interest with the application when requesting correction of another person's military records. An application may be returned when proper interest has not been shown.

        (3) A member, former member, employee or former employee, dependent, and current or former spouse may apply to correct a document or other record of any other military matter that affects them (This does not include records pertaining to civilian employment matters). Applicants will send proof of the effect of the document or record upon them with the application when requesting a correction under this provision.

        (b)  Applicants may get a DD Form 149, “Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. 1552,” and Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607, “ from:

        (1) Any Air Force Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or publications distribution office.

        (2) Most veterans' service organizations.

        (3) The Air Force Review Boards Office, SAF/MRBR, 550 C Street West, Suite 40, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4742.

        (4) The AFBCMR, 1535 Command Drive, EE Wing 3rd Floor, Andrews AFB MD 20762-7002.

        (5) Thru the Internet at  (DD Form 149) and  (Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607).

        (c)  Before applying, applicants should:

        (1) Review Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607.

        (2) Discuss their concerns with MPF, finance office, or other appropriate officials. Errors can often be corrected administratively without resort to the Board.

        (3) Exhaust other available administrative remedies (otherwise the Board may return the request without considering it).

        (d)  Applicants should complete all applicable sections of the DD Form 149, including at least:

        (1) The name under which the member served.

        (2) The member's social security number or Air Force service number.

        (3) The applicant's current mailing address.

        (4) The specific records correction being requested.

        (5) Proof of proper interest if requesting correction of another person's records.

        (6) The applicant's original signature.

        (e) Applicants should mail the original signed DD Form 149 and any supporting documents to the Air Force address on the back of the form.

        (f)  Ordinarily, applicants must file an application within 3 years after the error or injustice was discovered, or, with due diligence, should have been discovered. In accordance with federal law, time on active duty is not included in the 3 year period. An application filed later is untimely and may be denied by the Board on that basis.

        (1) The Board may excuse untimely filing in the interest of justice.

        (2) If the application is filed late, applicants should explain why it would be in the interest of justice for the Board to waive the time limits.

        (g)  Applying to the AFBCMR does not stay other proceedings.

        (h)  Applicants may be represented by counsel, at their own expense.

        (1) The term “counsel” includes members in good standing of the bar of any state, accredited representatives of veterans' organizations recognized under by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5902(a)(1), and other persons determined by the Executive Director of the Board to be competent to represent the interests of the applicant.

        (2) See DoDD 7050.06,     AFI 90-301,  for special provisions for counsel in cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 1034.

        (i)  Briefs in support of applications:

        (1) May not exceed 25 double-spaced typewritten pages.

        (2) Must be typed on one side of a page only with not more than 12 characters per inch.

        (3) Must be assembled in a manner that permits easy reproduction.

        (4) Responses to advisory opinions must not exceed 10 double-spaced typewritten pages and meet the other requirements for briefs.

        (5) These limitations do not apply to supporting documentary evidence.

        (6) In complex cases and upon request, the Executive Director of the Board may waive these limitations.

        (j)  Applicants may withdraw an application at any time before the Board's decision. Withdrawal does not stay the 3-year time limit.

        (k)  The Executive Director may return an application without action, if, after consultation with legal counsel, he or she determines that the application is clearly frivolous, or the remedy that is requested is beyond the authority of the Board. This authority may not be delegated.

        § 865.4   Board actions.

#### § § 865.4

        (a)  The applicant has the burden of providing sufficient evidence of material error or injustice. However, the Board:

        (1) May get additional information and advisory opinions on an application from any Air Force organization or official.

        (2) May ask the applicant to furnish additional information regarding matters before the Board.

        (b) Applicants will be given an opportunity to review and comment on advisory opinions and additional information obtained by the Board. They will also be provided with a copy of correspondence to or from the Air Force Review Boards Agency with an entity outside the Air Force Review Boards Agency in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1556.

        (c)  A panel consisting of at least three board members considers each application. One panel member serves as its chair. The panel's actions and decisions constitute the actions and decisions of the Board.

        (d) The panel may decide the case in executive session or authorize a hearing. When a hearing is authorized, the procedures in § 865.4(f), of this part, apply.

        (e)  Normally only members of the Board and Board staff will be present during deliberations. The panel chair may permit observers for training purposes or otherwise in furtherance of the functions of the Board.

        (f)  The Board in its sole discretion determines whether to grant a hearing. Applicants do not have a right to a hearing before the Board.

        (1) The Executive Director will notify the applicant or counsel, if any, of the time and place of the hearing. Written notice will be mailed 30 days in advance of the hearing unless the notice period is waived by the applicant. The applicant will respond not later than 15 days before the hearing date, accepting or declining the offer of a hearing and, if accepting, provide information pertaining to counsel and witnesses. The Board will decide the case in executive session if the applicant declines the hearing or fails to appear.

        (2) When granted a hearing, the applicant may appear before the Board with or without counsel and may present witnesses. It is the applicant's responsibility to notify witnesses, arrange for their attendance at the hearing, and pay any associated costs.

        (3) The panel chair conducts the hearing, maintains order, and ensures the applicant receives a full and fair opportunity to be heard. Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but the panel observes reasonable bounds of competency, relevancy, and materiality. Witnesses other than the applicant will not be present except when testifying. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation. A recorder will record the proceedings verbatim. The chair will normally limit hearings to 2 hours but may allow more time if necessary to ensure a full and fair hearing.

        (4) Additional provisions apply to cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 1034. See DoDD 7050.06,   , and AFI 90-301,

        (g) The Board will not deny or recommend denial of an application on the sole ground that the issue already has been decided by the Secretary of the Air Force or the President of the United States in another proceeding.

        (h)  The panel's majority vote constitutes the action of the Board. The Board will make determinations on the following issues in writing:

        (1) Whether the provisions of the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act apply to the application. This determination is needed only when the applicant invokes the protection of the Act, or when the question of its applicability is otherwise raised by the evidence.

        (2) Whether the application was timely filed and, if not, whether the applicant has demonstrated that it would be in the interest of justice to excuse the untimely filing. When the Board determines that an application is not timely, and does not excuse its untimeliness, the application will be denied on that basis.

        (3) Whether the applicant has exhausted all available and effective administrative remedies. If the applicant has not, the application will be denied on that basis.

        (4) Whether the applicant has demonstrated the existence of a material error or injustice that can be remedied effectively through correction of the applicant's military record and, if so, what corrections are needed to provide full and effective relief.

        (5) In Military Whistleblowers Protection Act cases only, whether to recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against any Air Force official whom the Board finds to have committed an act of reprisal against the applicant. Any determination on this issue will not be made a part of the Board's record of proceedings and will not be given to the applicant, but will be provided directly to the Secretary of the Air Force under separate cover (Sec 865.2b, of this part).

        (i)  The Board staff will prepare a record of proceedings following deliberations which will include:

        (1) The name and vote of each Board member.

        (2) The application.

        (3) Briefs and written arguments.

        (4) Documentary evidence.

        (5) A hearing transcript if a hearing was held.

        (6) Advisory opinions and the applicant's related comments.

        (7) The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Board.

        (8) Minority reports, if any.

        (9) Other information necessary to show a true and complete history of the proceedings.

        (j)  A dissenting panel member may prepare a minority report which may address any aspect of the case.

        (k)  The Board may send comments or recommendations to the Secretary of the Air Force as to administrative or disciplinary action against individuals found to have committed acts of reprisal prohibited by the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act and on other matters arising from an application not directly related to the requested correction of military records. Such comments and recommendations will be separately communicated and will not be included in the record of proceedings or given to the applicant or counsel.

        (l)  The Board acts for the Secretary of the Air Force and its decision is final when it:

        (1) Denies any application (except under 10 U.S.C. 1034).

        (2) Grants any application in whole or part when the relief was recommended by the official preparing the advisory opinion, was unanimously agreed to by the panel, and does not affect an appointment or promotion requiring confirmation by the Senate, and does not affect a matter for which the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her delegee has withheld decision authority or required notification before final decision.

        (3) The Board sends the record of proceedings on all other applications to the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her designee for final decision.

        (m) The Board may identify DoD or Air Force policies, instructions, guidance or practices that are leading to, or likely to lead to unsound business decisions, unfair results, waste of government funds or public criticism. The Board will forward such observations directly to the appropriate offices of the Secretariat and/or Air Staff for review and evaluation. Such observations will not be included in the record of proceedings.

        § 865.5   Decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.

#### § § 865.5

        (a) The Secretary may direct such action as he or she deems appropriate on each case, including returning the case to the Board for further consideration. Cases returned to the Board for further reconsideration will be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons for such action. If the Secretary does not accept the Board's recommendation, the Secretary's decision will be in writing and will include a brief statement of the grounds for his/her final decision.

        (b)  The Secretary will issue decisions on such cases within 180 days after receipt of the case and will, unless the full relief requested is granted, inform applicants of their right to request review of the decision by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef). Applicants will also be informed:

        (1) Of the name and address of the official to whom the request for review must be submitted.

        (2) That the request for review must be submitted within 90 days after receipt of the decision by the Secretary of the Air Force.

        (3) That the request for review must be in writing and include the applicant's name, address, and telephone number; a copy of the application to the AFBCMR and the final decision of the Secretary of the Air Force; and a statement of the specific reasons the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.

        (4) That the request must be based on the Board record; requests for review based on factual allegations or evidence not previously presented to the Board will not be considered under this paragraph but may be the basis for reconsideration by the Board under § 865.6.

        (c) In cases under § 865.5(b) of this part which involve additional issues not cognizable under that paragraph, the additional issues may be considered separately by the Board under § 865.3 and § 865.4 of this part. The special time limit in § 865.5 (b) does not apply to the decision concerning these additional issues.

        (d)  Prior to taking final action on a BCMR application that has generated, or is likely to generate, significant public or Congressional interest, the Secretarial designee will provide the case record of proceedings through Secretarial channels to OSAF so that the Secretary can determine whether to decide the case personally or take other action the Secretary deems appropriate.

        § 865.6   Reconsideration of applications.

#### § § 865.6

        (a) The Board may reconsider an application if the applicant submits newly discovered relevant evidence that was not reasonably available when the application was previously considered. The Executive Director or Team Chiefs will screen each request for reconsideration to determine whether it contains new evidence. New arguments about, or analysis of, evidence already considered, and additional statements which are cumulative to those already in the record of proceedings will not be considered new evidence.

        (b) If the request contains new evidence, the Executive Director or his/her designee will refer it to a panel of the Board for a decision. The Board will decide the relevance and weight of any new evidence, whether it was reasonably available to the applicant when the application was previously considered, and whether it was submitted in a timely manner. The Board may deny reconsideration if the request does not meet the criteria for reconsideration. Otherwise the Board will reconsider the application and decide the case either on timeliness or merit as appropriate.

        (c) If the request does not contain new evidence, the Executive Director or his/her designee will return it to the applicant without referral to the Board.

        § 856.7   Action after final decision.

#### § § 856.7

        (a)  The Executive Director or his/her designee will inform the applicant or counsel, if any, of the final decision on the application. If any requested relief was denied, the Executive Director will advise the applicant of reconsideration procedures and, for cases processed under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, review by the SecDef. The Executive Director will send decisions requiring corrective action to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, for necessary action.

        (b)  The Air Force is authorized, under 10 U.S.C. 1552, to pay claims for amounts due to applicants as a result of correction of military records.

        (1) The Executive Director will furnish the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) with AFBCMR decisions potentially affecting monetary entitlement or benefits. DFAS will treat such decisions as claims for payment by or on behalf of the applicant.

        (2) DFAS settles claims on the basis of the corrected military record. Computation of the amount due, if any, is a function of DFAS. Applicants may be required to furnish additional information to DFAS to establish their status as proper parties to the claim and to aid in deciding amounts due.

        (3) Earnings received from civilian employment during any period for which active duty pay and allowances are payable will be deducted from the settlement. Amounts found due will be offset by the amount of any existing indebtedness to the government in compliance with the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or successor statutes.

        (c)  After deletion of personal information, AFBCMR decisions will be made available for review and copying at an electronic public reading room.

        § 865.8   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 865.8

        (a) At the request of the Board, all Air Force activities and officials will furnish the Board with:

        (1) All available military records pertinent to an application.

        (2) An advisory opinion concerning an application. The advisory opinion will include an analysis of the facts of the case and of the applicant's contentions, a statement of whether or not the requested relief can be done administratively, and a recommendation on the timeliness and merit of the request. Regardless of the recommendation, the advisory opinion will include instructions on specific corrective action to be taken if the Board grants the application.

        (b)  Applicants will have access to all records considered by the Board, except those classified or privileged. To the extent practicable, applicants will be provided unclassified or nonprivileged summaries or extracts of such records considered by the Board.

        (c)  The Air Force has no authority to pay expenses of any kind incurred by or on behalf of an applicant in connection with a correction of military records under 10 U.S.C. 1034 or 1552.

        The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for the overall operation of the Discharge Review program within the Department of the Air Force. The following delegation of authority have been made:

        (a) To the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Installations) to act for the Secretary of the Air Force in all discharge review actions subject to review by the Secretary as specified in § 865.113 of this subpart.

        (b) To the Director, Air Force Personnel Council, for operation of all phases of the discharge review function and authority to take action in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force in all discharge review actions except those specified in § 865.113 of this subpart.

        § 865.105   Jurisdiction and authority.

#### § § 865.105

        The DRB has jurisdiction and authority in cases of former military personnel who, at the time of their separation from the Service, were members of the US Army Aviation components (Aviation Section, Signal Corps; Air Service; Air Corps; or Air Forces) prior to September 17, 1947, or the US Air Force. The DRB does not have jurisdiction and authority concerning personnel of other armed services who at the time of their separation, were assigned to duty with the Army Air Forces or the US Air Force.

        (a) The DRB's review is based on the former member's available military records, issues submitted by the former member, or his counsel and on any other evidence that is presented to the DRB. The DRB determines whether the type of discharge or dismissal the former member received is equitable and proper; if not, the DRB instructs the USAF Manpower and Personnel Center (AFMPC) to change the discharge reason or to issue a new character of discharge according to the DRB's findings.

        (b) The DRB is not authorized to revoke any discharge, to reinstate any person who has been separated from the military service, or to recall any person to active duty.

        (c) The DRB, on its own motion, may review a case that appears likely to result in a decision favorable to the former military member, without the member's knowledge or presence. In this case, if the decision is:

        (1) Favorable, the DRB directs AFMPC to notify the former member accordingly at the member's last known address.

        (2) Unfavorable, the DRB returns the case to the files without any record of formal action; the DRB then reconsiders the case without prejudice in accordance with normal procedures.

        § 865.106   Application for review.

#### § § 865.106

        (a)  Applications shall be submitted to the Air Force DRB on DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Dismissal from the Armed Forces of the United States (OMB Approval No. 0704-0004) with such other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the applicant's advantage to submit such documents with the application or within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DOD installations and regional offices of the Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.

        (b)  A motion or request for review must be made within 15 years after the date of discharge or dismissal.

        (c)  An applicant may request a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).

        (1)  DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in character of discharge (for example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only a person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level status may request a change from other than an honorable discharge to Entry Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does not have an Honorable Discharge will be treated as a request for a change to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a specific change to another character of discharge.

        (2)  DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for discharge. If an applicant does not request a specific change in the reason for discharge, the DRB will presume that the request for review does not involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under its responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's discharge, the DRB will change the reason for discharge if such a change is warranted.

        (3) The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in “Board Action Requested” of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a difference between an applicant's issue and the requested action, the DRB will respond to the issue in the context of the action requested in “Board Action Requested.” In the case of a Personal Appearance hearing, the DRB will attempt to resolve the ambiguity.

        (d) If the member is deceased or mentally incompetent, the spouse, next-of-kin, or legal representative may, as agent for the member, submit the application for the review along with proof of the member's death or mental incompetency.

        (e) Applicants forward their requests for review to the USAF Manpower and Personnel Center-mailing address: AFMPC/MPCDOA1, Randolph AFB TX 78150. AFMPC will obtain all available military records of the former members from the National Personnel Records Center.

        (f)  An applicant shall be permitted to withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review.

        (g)  Issues must be provided to the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation and should be submitted in accordance with the guidelines of this subpart for submission of issues.

        (1)  An issue must be stated clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.

        (2)  Each issue submitted by an applicant should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the issue is conveyed to the DRB.

        (3)  DD Form 293 provides applicants with a standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:

        (i) Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, provide a basis for changing the discharge;

        (ii) Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be important by an applicant;

        (iii) Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a decisional issue under § 865.112, and those matters submitted simply as background or supporting materials;

        (iv) Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that the applicant later submits a complaint under § 865.121 of this subpart concerning the decisional document.

        (v) Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an applicant's issue.

        (4)  If the applicant makes an additional written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the applicant may incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly urged to set forth all issues as a separate item at the beginning of the brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently has failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond to such an issue in accordance with §§ 865.111 and 865.112 of this subpart.

        (5)  With respect to applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD Form 293, the application will be returned with a copy of the revised DD Form 293 for reaccomplishment. The DRB will only respond to the issues submitted on the new form in accordance with 32 CFR part 70, 47 FR 37770, August 26, 1982 and this subpart.

        (h)  If the application applies to both character of and reason for discharge, the applicant is encouraged, but not required, to identify the issue as applying to the character of or reason for discharge (or both). Unless the issue is directed at the reason for discharge expressly or by necessary implication, the DRB will presume that it applies solely to the character of discharge.

        (i)  The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in § 865.120 of this subpart. The applicant is encouraged to review those standards before submitting any issue upon which the applicant believes a change in discharge should be based. The applicant is also encouraged, but not required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the propriety or the equity of the discharge. This will assist the DRB in assessing the relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under § 865.112(d) of this subpart.

        (j)  The primary function of the DRB involves the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as the basis for a change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring the DRB's attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative material, the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting documents. If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an issue that sets forth specific principles and facts from a specific cited decision, the following requirements apply with respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982.

        (1) The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the “Applicant's Issue” portion of DD Form 293.

        (2) If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB, another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.

        (3) To insure timely consideration of principles cited from unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces Discharge Review Board/Correction Board Reading Room), the applicant must provide the DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant portion of treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles were discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be returned.

        (4) If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements above, the decisional document shall note the defect, and shall respond to the issue without regard to the citation.

        (k)  The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this section after a review of all materials and information is made.

        (1)  The DRB shall consider all items submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated therein) in accordance with this part. With respect to applications submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider all issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of the submission.

        (2)  The DRB shall not request or instruct an applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant. Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be confirmed in writing by the applicant. This provision does not:

        (i) Limit by DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the meaning of such matter;

        (ii) Preclude the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon such questions:

        (iii) Prevent the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or

        (iv) Prevent the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's submission. The written information will state that the applicant's decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used against the applicant in the consideration of the case.

        (3) Additional Issues Identified During a Hearing. The following additional procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote the DRB's understanding of an applicant's presentation. If before closing the hearing for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant has presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the FRB may so inform the applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB from developing its own decisional issues.

        (l)  Written notification shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board for Correction of Military Records or the Veterans Administration may confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar to benefits based upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, the following applies:

        (1) Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.

        (2) Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.

        § 865.107   DRB composition and meeting location.

#### § § 865.107

        (a) The DRB consists of five members, with the senior line officer acting as the presiding officer. The presiding officer convenes, recesses and adjourns the Board.

        (b) In addition to holding hearings in Washington, DC, the DRB, as a convenience to applicants, periodically conducts hearings at selected locations throughout the Continental United States. Reviews are conducted at locations central to those areas with the greatest number of applicants. A continuing review and appraisal is conducted to ensure the selected hearing locations are responsive to a majority of applicants. Administrative details and responsibilities for Regional Boards are outlined in § 865.124.

        § 865.108   Availability of records and documents.

#### § § 865.108

        (a) Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or their designated resentatives may, and are encouraged to obtain copies of their military personnel records by submitting a General Services Administration Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, Mo 63132; thus avoiding any lengthy delays in the processing of the application (DD Form 293) and the scheduling of reviews.

        (1) Once the application for discharge review (DD Form 293) is submitted, an applicant's military records are forwarded to the DRB where they cannot be reproduced. Submission of a request for an applicant's military records, including a request under the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act after the DD Form 293 has been submitted, shall result automatically in the termporary suspension of processing of the application for discharge review until the requested records are sent to an appropriate location for copying, are copied, and returned to the headquarters of the DRB. Processing of the application shall then be resumed at whatever stage of the discharge review process is practicable.

        (2) Applicants and their designated representatives also may examine their military personnel records at the site of their scheduled review before the hearing. The DRB shall notify applicants and their designated representatives of the dates the records are available for examination in their standard scheduling information.

        (b) The DRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents that are under the cognizance of another government department, office, or activity. Applications for such information must be made by the applicant to the cognizant authority. The DRB shall advise the applicant of the mailing address of the government department, office, or activity to which the request should be submitted.

        (c) If the official records relevant to the discharge review are not available at the agency having custody of the records, the applicant shall be so notified and requested to provide such information and documents as may be desired in support of the request for discharge review. A period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed for such documents to be submitted. At the expiration of this period, the review may be conducted with information available to the DRB.

        (d) The DRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with appropriate modifications regarding classified material.

        (1) In any case heard on the request of an applicant, the DRB shall provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The DRB shall also notify the applicant or counsel or representative (i) of the right to examine such documents or to be provided with copies of documents upon request; (ii) of the date by which such request must be received; and (iii) of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time to be set be the DRB.

        (2) When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the DRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document, deleting all reference to source of information and other matters, the disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would be detrimental to the national security interest of the United States. Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the classifying authority, information from the classified source shall not be considered by the DRB in its review of the case.

        (e) Current Air Force numbered publications may be obtained from the Chief, Central Base Administration at any major Air Force installation or by writing:

        § 865.109   Procedures for hearings.

#### § § 865.109

        (a) The applicant is entitled, by law, to appear in person at his or her request before the DRB in open session and to be represented by counsel of his or her own selection. The applicant also may present such witnesses as he or she may desire.

        (b) There are two types of reviews. They are:

        (1)  A review of the application, available service records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.

        (2)  A personal appearance before the DRB by the applicant with or without counsel, or by the counsel only.

        (c) The Government does not compensate or pay the expenses of the applicant, applicant's witnesses, or counsel.

        (d) A summary of the available military records of the applicant is prepared for use by the DRB in the review process. A copy of the summary is available to the applicant and/or his or her counsel, upon request.

        (e) When an applicant has requested a personal appearance and/or representation by counsel on the DD Form 293, the DRB sends written notice of the hearing time and place to the applicant and designated counsel. Evidence of such notification will be placed in the applicant's record.

        (f) Personal appearance hearings shall be conducted with recognition of the rights of the individual to privacy. Accordingly, presence at hearings of individuals other than those whose presence is required will be limited to persons authorized by the presiding officer and/or expressly requested by the applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space.

        (g) Formal rules of evidence shall not be applied in DRB proceedings. The presiding officer shall rule on matters of procedure and shall ensure that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are maintained in the taking of evidence and presentation of witnesses. Applicants and witnesses may present evidence to the DRB panel either in person or by affidavit or through counsel. If an applicant or witness testifies under oath or affirmation, he or she is subject to questioning by Board members.

        (h) There is a presumption of regularity in the conduct of governmental affairs. This presumption can be applied in any review unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption.

        (i)  (1) Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force, further opportunity for a personal appearance hearing shall not be made available in the following circumstances to an applicant who has requested a hearing.

        (i) When the applicant and/or a designated counsel or representative has been sent a letter containing the date and location of a proposed hearing and fails to make a timely response; or

        (ii) When the applicant and/or a designated representative, after being notified by letter of the time and place of the hearing, fails to appear at the appointed time, either in person or by representative, without having made a prior, timely request for a postponement or withdrawal.

        (2) In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived his/her right to a hearing, and the DRB shall complete its review of the discharge. Further request for a hearing shall not be granted unless the applicant can demonstrate that the failure to appear or respond was due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.

        (j)  (1) A continuance of a discharge review hearing may be authorized by the presiding officer of the Board concerned, provided that such continuance is of a reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a full and fair hearing. Where a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.

        (2) Postponements of scheduled reviews normally shall not be permitted other than for demonstrated good and sufficient reason set forth by the applicant in a timely manner, or for the convenience of the government.

        (k)  A discharge review shall not be subject to reconsideration except:

        (1) Where the only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of the DRB;

        (2) When the original discharge review did not involve a personal appearance hearing and a personal appearance is now desired, and the provisions of § 865.109(j) do not apply;

        (3) Where changes in discharge policy are announced subsequent to an earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made expressly retroactive;

        (4) Where the DRB determines that policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceeding;

        (5) Where an individual is to be represented by a counsel/representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration of the case.

        (6) Where the case was not previously considered under the uniform standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and application is made for such consideration within 15 years after the date of discharge; or

        (7) On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original review. The decision as to whether evidence offered by an applicant in support of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, relevant, and was not available to the applicant at the time of the original review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the evidence considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison shows that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on matters concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request for reconsideration shall be granted.

        § 865.110   Decision process.

#### § § 865.110

        (a) The DRB shall meet in plenary session to review discharges and exercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis in applying the standards set forth in this regulation.

        (b) The presiding officer is responsible for the conduct of the discharge review. The presiding officer shall convene, recess, and adjourn the DRB as appropriate, and shall maintain an atmosphere of dignity and decorum at all times.

        (c) Each board member shall act under oath or affirmation requiring careful, objective consideration of the application. They shall consider all relevant material and competent information presented to them by the applicant. In addition, they shall consider all available military records, together with such other records as may be in the files and relevant to the issues before the DRB.

        (d) The DRB shall identify and address issues after a review of the following material obtained and presented in accordance with this subpart and 32 CFR part 70: available official military records, documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of the applicant, presentation of testimony by or on behalf of the applicant, oral or written arguments presented by or on behalf of the applicant, and any other relevant evidence.

        (e) Application of Standards:

        (1) When the DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was improper, the DRB will determine which reason for discharge should have been assigned based upon the facts and circumstances properly before the discharge authority in view of the regulations governing reasons for discharge at the time the applicant was discharged.

        (2) When the board determines that an applicant's discharge was inequitable, any change will be based on the evaluation of the applicant's overall record of service and relevant regulations.

        (f) Voting shall be conducted in closed session, a majority of the five members' votes constituting the DRB's decision.

        (g) Details of closed session deliberations of a DRB are privileged information and shall not be divulged.

        (h) A formal minority opinion may be submitted in instances of disagreement between members of a board. The opinion must cite findings, conclusions and reasons which are the basis for the opinion. The complete case with the majority and minority recommendations will be submitted to the Director, Air Force Personnel Council.

        (i) The DRB may request advisory opinions from staff offices of the Air Force. These opinions are advisory in nature and are not binding on the DRB in its decision making process.

        § 865.111   Response to items submitted as issues by the applicant.

#### § § 865.111

        (a) If an issue submitted by an applicant contains two or more clearly separate issues, the DRB should respond to each issue under the guidance of this section as if it had been set forth separately by the applicant.

        (b) If an applicant uses a “building block” approach (that is, setting forth a series of conclusions on issues that lead to a single conclusion purportedly warranting a change in the applicant's discharge), normally there should be a separate response to each issue.

        (c) This section does not preclude the DRB from making a single response to multiple issues when such action would enhance the clarity of the decisional document, but such response must reflect an adequate response to each separate issue.

        (d) An item submitted as an issue by an applicant in accordance with this regulation shall be addressed as a decisional issue under § 865.112 of this subpart in the following circumstances:

        (1) When the DRB decides that a change in discharge should be granted, and the DRB bases its decision in whole or in part on the applicant's issue; or

        (2) When the DRB does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, and the decision is based in whole or in part on the DRB's disagreement with the merits of an issue submitted by the applicant.

        (e) If the applicant receives the full change in discharge requested (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis shall be addressed as a decisional issue even if that basis is not addressed as an issue by the applicant. No further response is required to other issues submitted by the applicant.

        (f) If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge requested with respect to either the character of or reason for discharge (or both), the DRB shall address the items submitted by the applicant unless one of the following responses is applicable:

        (1)  The DRB may state that there is a full response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified decisional issue. This respose may be used only when one issue clearly duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in conjunction with another issue.

        (2)  The DRB may state that any issue, which consists of a citation of a previous decision without setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that the applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not comply with the requirements of § 865.106(g)(1) of this part.

        (3)  The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of the item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under § 865.110(d) of this subpart.

        (4)  The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under § 865.110(d), cannot determine the relationship between the applicant's submission and the particular circumstances of the case. This response may be used only if the submission is expressed in such general terms that no other response is applicable. For example, if the DRB disagrees with the applicant as to the relevance of matters set forth in the submission, the DRB normally will set forth the nature of the disagreement under the guidance in § 865.112 of this subpart with respect to decisional issues, or it will reject the applicant's position on the basis of § 865.111(f)(1) or § 865.111(f)(2). If the applicant's submission is so general that none of those provisions is applicable, then the DRB may state that it cannot respond because the item is not specific.

        § 865.112   Decisional issues.

#### § § 865.112

        (a) The decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge. In order to enhance clarity, the DRB should not address matters other than issues relied upon in the decision or raised by the applicant.

        (b)  When the decision changes a discharge but does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, the decisional document shall address both the issues upon which change is granted and the issues upon which the DRB denies the full change requested.

        (c)  Generally, the decisional document should specify whether a decisional issue applies to the character of or reason for discharge (or both), but it is not required to do so.

        (d)  (1) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.

        (2) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to the propriety of the discharge (for example, by citing a propriety standard or otherwise claiming that a change in discharge is required as a matter of law), the DRB shall consider the issue solely as a matter of propriety. Except as provided in § 865.112(d)(4), the DRB is not required to consider such an issue under the equity standards.

        (3) If the applicant's issue contends that the DRB is required as a matter of law to follow a prior decision by setting forth an issue of propriety from the prior decision and decribing its relationship to the applicant's case, the issue shall be considered under the propriety standards and addressed under § 865.112(e) or § 865.112(f).

        (4) If the applicant's issue sets forth principles of equity contained in a prior DRB decision, describes the relationship to the applicant's case, and contends that the DRB is required as a matter of law to follow the prior case, the decisional document shall note that the DRB is not bound by its discretionary decisions in prior cases under the standards in § 865.120 of this subpart. However, the principles cited by the applicant, and the description of the relationship of the principles to the applicant's case, shall be considered under the equity standards and addressed under § 865.112(h) or § 865.112(i).

        (5) If the applicant's issue cannot be identified as a matter of propriety or equity, the DRB shall address it as an issue of equity.

        (e)  If a change in the discharge is warranted under the propriety standards the decisional document shall state that conclusion and list the errors or expressly retroactive changes in policy that provide a basis for the conclusion. The decisional document shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the error or change in policy to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not granting the full change shall be addressed.

        (f)  If the decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, or if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion. The decisional document shall list reasons for its conclusion on each issue of propriety under the following guidance:

        (1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the particular circumstances in the case.

        (2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for the applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each such event or circumstance.

        (i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a citation is not required.

        (ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.

        (3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of propriety, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in § 842.112(f) (1) and (2).

        (i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).

        (ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.

        (iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by stating that the applicant's issue of propriety is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge, and by providing an explanation for this position. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be considered in conjunction with one or more other specified issues, the explanation will address all such specified issues.

        (iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.

        (v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge must be changed because of an alleged error in a record associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective action. If the organization empowered to correct the record is within the Department of the Air Force, the DRB should provide the applicant with a brief description of the procedures for requesting correction of the record. If the DRB on its own motion cites this issue as a decisional issue on the basis of equity, it shall address the issue as such.

        (vi) When an applicant's issue contains a general allegation that a certain course of action violated his or her constitutional rights, respond in appropriate cases by noting that the action was consistent with statutory or regulatory authority, and by citing the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to statutes and regulations. If, on the other hand, the applicant makes a specific challenge to the constitutionality of the action by challenging the application of a statute or regulation is a particular set of circumstances, it is not sufficient to respond solely by citing the presumption of constitutionality of the statute or regulation when the applicant is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute or regulation. Instead, the response must address the specific circumstances of the case.

        (g)  If the applicant has not submitted an issue of propriety and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of propriety to change the discharge, the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect. The DRB is not required to provide any further discussion as to the propriety of the discharge.

        (h)  If the DRB concludes that a change in the discharge is warranted under equity standards the decisional document shall list each issue of equity upon which this conclusion is based. The DRB shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the issue to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not giving the full change requested shall be discussed.

        (i)  If the DRB rejects the applicant's position on an issue of equity, or if the decision otherwise provides less than the full change in discharge requested by the applicant, the decisional document shall note that conclusion. The DRB shall list reasons for its conclusions on each issue of equity in accordance with the following:

        (1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the exercise of discretion on the issue of equity in the applicant's case.

        (2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for the applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each such event or circumstance.

        (i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a citation is not required.

        (ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.

        (3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of equity, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in § 865.112(i) (1) and (2):

        (i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).

        (ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.

        (iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by explaining why the applicant's issue is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge as a matter of equity. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be considered in conjunction with other specified issues, the explanation will address all such issues.

        (iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.

        (v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge should be changed as a matter of equity because of an alleged error in a record associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, the DRB may respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective action. However, the DRB will consider whether it should exercise its equitable powers to change the discharge on the basis of the alleged error. If it declines to do so, the DRB shall explain why the applicant's position did not provide a sufficient basis for the change in the discharge requested by the applicant.

        (4) When the DRB concludes that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors, the DRB must set forth reasons such as the seriousness of the offense, specific circumstances surrounding the offense, number of offenses, lack of mitigating circumstances, or similar factors. The DRB is not required, however, to explain why it relied on any such factors unless the applicability or weight of such factors are expressly raised as an issue by the applicant.

        (5) If the applicant has not submitted any issues and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of equity for a change in discharge, the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect, and shall note that the major factors upon which the discharge was based are set forth in the service record portion of the decisional document.

        § 865.113   Recommendations by the Director of the Personnel Council and Secretarial Review Authority.

#### § § 865.113

        (2) Cases when required in order to provide information to the Secretary on specific aspects of the discharge review function which are of interest to the Secretary.

        (3) Any case which the Director, Air Force Personnel Council believes is of significant interest to the Secretary.

        (c) The Secretarial Reviewing Authority is the Secretary of the Air Force or the official to whom he has delegated this authority. The SRA may review the types of cases described above before issuance of the final notification of a decision. Those cases forwarded for review by the SRA shall be considered under the standards set forth in § 865.121 and DOD Directive 1332.28.

        (d) There is no requirement that the Director of the Personnel Council submit a recommendation when a case is forwarded to the SRA. If a recommendation is submitted, however, it should be in accordance with the guidelines described below.

        (e) Format for Recommendation. If a recommendation is provided, it shall contain the Director's views whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both). If the Director recommends such a change, the particular change to be made shall be specified. The recommendation shall set forth the Director's position on decisional issues submitted by the applicant in accordance with the following:

        (1) Adoption of the DRB's Decisional document. The recommendation may state that the Director has adopted the decisional document prepared by the majority. The Director shall ensure that the decisional document meets the requirements of this regulation.

        (2) Adoption of the Specific Statements From the Majority. If the Director adopts the views of the majority only in part, the recommendation shall cite the specific matter adopted from the majority. If the Director modifies a statement submitted by the majority, the recommendation shall set forth the modification.

        (3) Response to Issues Not Included in Matter Adopted From the Majority. The recommendation shall set forth the following if not adopted in whole or in part from the majority:

        (i) The issues on which the Director's recommendation is based. Each such decisional issue shall be addressed by the Director in accordance with § 865.112 of this subpart.

        (ii) The Director's response to items submitted as issues by the applicant under § 865.111 of this subpart.

        (iii) Reasons for rejecting the conclusions of the majority with respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in the applicant's favor, would have resulted in greater relief for the applicant than that afforded by the Director's recommendation. Each issue shall be addressed in accordance with § 865.112 of this subpart.

        (f) Copies of the proposed decisional document on cases that have been forwarded to the SRA (except for cases reviewed on the DRB's own motion without the participation of the applicant or the applicant's counsel) shall be provided to the applicant and counsel or representative, if any. The document will include the Director's recommendation to the SRA, if any. Classified information shall be summarized.

        (g) The applicant shall be provided with a reasonable period of time, but not less than 25 days, to submit a rebuttal to the SRA. An issue in rebuttal consists of a clear and specific statement by the applicant in support of or in opposition to the statements of the DRB or Director on decisional issues and other clear and specific issues that were submitted by the applicant. The rebuttal shall be based solely on matters in the record when the DRB closed the case for deliberation or in the Director's recommendation.

        (h)  If corrections in the decisional document are required, the decisional document shall be returned to the DRB for corrective action. The corrected decisional document shall be sent to the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, but a further opportunity for rebuttal is not required unless the correction produces a different result or includes a substantial change in the discussion by the DRB or Director of the issues raised by the majority or the applicant.

        (i)  The decision of the SRA shall be in writing and shall be appended as an addendum to the decisional document.

        (1)  The addendum shall set forth the SRA's decision whether there will be a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both); if the SRA concludes that a change is warranted, the particular change to be made shall be specified. If the SRA adopts the decision recommended by the DRB or the Director, the decisional document shall contain a reference to the matter adopted.

        (2)  In support of the SRA's decision, the addendum shall set forth the SRA's position on decisional issues, items submitted by an applicant and issues raised by the DRB and the Director. The addendum will state that:

        (i) The SRA has adopted the Director's recommendation.

        (ii) The SRA has adopted the proposed decisional document prepared by the DRB.

        (iii) If the SRA adopts the views of the DRB or the Director only in part, the addendum shall cite the specific statements adopted. If the SRA modifies a statement submitted by the DRB or the Director, the addendum shall set forth the modification.

        (3)  The addendum shall set forth the following if not adopted in whole or in part from the DRB or the Director:

        (i) A list of the issues on which the SRA's decision is based. Each such decisional issue shall be addressed by the SRA. This includes reasons for rejecting the conclusion of the DRB or the Director with respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in the applicant's favor, would have resulted in change to the discharge more favorable to the applicant than that afforded by the SRA's decision.

        (ii) The SRA's response to items submitted as issues by the applicant will be in accordance with § 865.111 of this subpart.

        (4)  (i) If the SRA grants the full change in discharge requested by the applicant (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted, the decisional document shall be addressed accordingly, and no further response to the rebuttal is required.

        (ii) If the SRA does not grant the full change in discharge requested by the applicant (or a more favorable change), the addendum shall list each issue in rebuttal submitted by an applicant and shall set forth the response of the SRA under the following:

        (A) If the SRA rejects an issue in rebuttal, the SRA may respond in accordance with the principles in § 865.112 of this subpart.

        (B) If the matter adopted by the SRA provides a basis for the SRA's rejection of the rebuttal material, the SRA may note that fact and cite the specific matter adopted that responds to the issue in rebuttal.

        (C) If the matter submitted by the applicant does not meet the requirements for rebuttal material in paragraph (g) of this section, that fact shall be noted.

        (j)  Appropriate index entries shall be prepared for the SRA's actions for matters that are not adopted from the DRB's proposed decisional document.

        § 865.118   Availability of Discharge Review Board documents for public inspection and copying.

#### § § 865.118

        (a) A copy of the decisional document prepared in accordance with § 865.114 of this subpart, shall be made available for public inspection and copying promptly after a notice of final decision is sent to the applicant.

        (b) To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, identifying details of the applicant and other persons will be deleted from documents made available for public inspection and copying. Names, addresses, social security numbers, and military service numbers must be deleted. Written justification shall be made for all other deletions and shall be available for public inspection.

        (c) The DRB shall ensure that there is a means for relating a decisional document number to the name of the applicant to permit retrieval of the applicant's records when required in processing a complaint in accordance with § 865.121 of this subpart.

        (d) Any other privileged or classified material contained in or appended to any documents required to be furnished the applicant and counsel/representative or made available for public inspection and copying may be deleted therefrom only if a written statement of the basis for the deletions is provided the applicant and counsel/representative and made available for public inspection. It is not intended that the statement be so detailed as to reveal the nature of the withheld material.

        (e) DRB documents made available for public inspection and copying shall be located in the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Boards Reading Room. The documents shall be indexed in usable and concise form so as to enable the public and those who represent applicants before the DRB to isolate from all these decisions that are indexed those cases that may be similar to an applicant's case and that indicate the circumstances under and/or reasons for which the DRB or the Secretary of the Air Force granted or denied relief.

        (1) The reading file index shall include, in addition to any other items determined by the DRB, the case number, the date, character of, reason for, and authority for the discharge. It shall further include the decisions of the DRB and reviewing authority, if any, and the issues addressed in the statement of findings, conclusions and reasons.

        (2) The index shall be maintained at selected permanent locations throughout the United States. This ensures reasonable availability to applicants at least 30 days before a regional board review. The index shall also be made available at sites selected for regional Boards for such periods as the DRB is present and in operation. An applicant who has requested a regional board review shall be advised in the notice of scheduled hearings.

        (3) The Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading Room shall publish indexes quarterly for the DRB. The DRB shall be responsible for timely submission to the Reading Room of individual case information required for update of indexes. These indexes shall be available for public inspection or purchase (or both) at the Reading Room. This information will be provided to applicants in the notice of acceptance of the application.

        (4) Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the Reading Room (including request for purchase of indexes) shall be addressed to:

        § 865.119   Privacy Act information.

#### § § 865.119

        Information protected under the Privacy Act is involved in discharge review functions. The provisions of 32 CFR part 286a will be observed throughout the processing of a request for review of discharge or dismissal.

        § 865.120   Discharge review standards.

#### § § 865.120

        (a)  The objective of a discharge review is to examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes, if necessary. The standards of review and the underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. No factors shall be established which require automatic change or denial of a change in a discharge. Neither the DRB nor the Secretary of the Air Force shall be bound by any methodology of weighing of the factors in reaching a determination. In each case, the DRB or Secretary of the Air Force shall give full, fair, and impartial consideration to all applicable factors prior to reaching a decision. An applicant may not receive a less favorable discharge than that issued at the time of separation. This does not preclude correction of clerical errors.

        (b)  A discharge shall be deemed to be proper unless in the course of discharge review, it is determined that:

        (1) There exists an error of fact, law, procedures, or discretion associated with the discharge at the time of issuance; and that the rights of the applicant were prejudiced thereby (such error shall constitute prejudicial error, if there is substantial doubt that the discharge would have remained the same if the error had not been made); or

        (2) A change in policy by the Air Force made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge under consideration, requires a change in the discharge.

        (c) When a record associated with the discharge at the time of issuance involves a matter in which the primary responsibility for corrective action rests with another organization (for example, another Board, agency, or court), the DRB will recognize an error only to the extent that the error has been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for correcting the record.

        (d) The primary function of the DRB is to exercise its discretion on issues of equity by reviewing the individual merits of each application on a case-by-case basis. Prior decisions in which the DRB exercised its discretion to change a discharge based on issues of equity (including the factors cited in such decisions or the weight given to factors in such decisions) do not blind the DRB in its review of subsequent cases because no two cases present the same issues of equity.

        (e) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully honorable administrative discharges because of their civilian misconduct while in an inactive reserve component and who were discharged or had their discharge reviewed on or after April 20, 1971: the DRB shall either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without any additional proceedings or additional proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Court's Order of December 3, 1981, in Wood v. Secretary of Defense to determine whether proper grounds exist for the issuance of a less than honorable discharge, taking into account that:

        (1) An Under Other Than Honorable (formerly Undesirable) Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct found to have affected directly the performance of military duties;

        (2) A General Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct found to have had an adverse impact on the overall effectiveness of the military, including military morale and efficiency.

        (f) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully honorable administrative discharges (between June 21, 1971 and March 2, 1982) because evidence developed by or as a direct result of complusory urinalysis testing was introduced in the discharge proceedings. Applicants who believe they are members of the above category will so indicate this by writing “CATEGORY W” in block 7 of their DD Form 293. AFMPC/MPCDOA1 will expedite processing these applications to the designated “CATEGORY W” reviewer. For class members the designated reviewer shall either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without any additional proceedings or complete a review to determine whether proper ground exists for the issuance of a less than honorable discharge. If the applicant is determined not to be a class member, the application is returned to normal review procedure channels. If new administrative proceedings are initiated, the former service member must be notified of:

        (1) The basis of separation other than drug abuse or use or possession of drugs based upon compelled urinalysis that was specified in the commander's report and upon which the Air Force now seeks to base a less than honorable discharge.

        (2) The full complement of procedural protections that are required by current regulations.

        (3) Name, address and telephone number of an Area Defense Counsel with whom the former service member has a right to consult, and

        (4) The right to participate in the new proceedings to be conducted at the Air Force base nearest the former service member's current address, or to elect to maintain his or her present character of discharge.

        (g)  A discharge shall be deemed to be equitable unless:

        (1) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that the policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration provided that:

        (i) Current policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceedings; and

        (ii) There is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings under consideration.

        (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with standards of discipline in the Air Force; or

        (3) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that a change is warranted based upon consideration of the applicant's military record and other evidence presented to the DRB viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in this section and the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, even though the discharge was determined to have been otherwise equitable and proper at the time of issuance. Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Quality of Service, as evidenced by factors such as:

        (A) Service History, including date of enlistment, period of enlistment, highest rank achieved, conduct or efficiency ratings (numerical or narrative).

        (B) Awards and decorations.

        (C) Letters of commendation or reprimand.

        (D) Combat service.

        (E) Wounds received in action.

        (F) Record of promotions and demotions.

        (G) Level of responsibility at which the applicant served.

        (H) Other acts of merit that may not have resulted in a formal recognition through an award or commendation.

        (I) Length of service during the period which is the subject of the discharge review.

        (J) Prior military service and type of discharge received or outstanding post-service conduct to the extent that such matters provide a basis for a more thorough understanding of the performance of the applicant during the period of service which is the subject of the discharge review.

        (K) Convictions by court-martial.

        (L) Record of non-judicial punishment.

        (M) Convictions by civil authorities while a member of the Air Force, reflected in the discharge proceedings or otherwise noted in military records.

        (N) Record of periods of unauthorized absence.

        (O) Records relating to a discharge in lieu of court-martial.

        (ii) Capability to Serve, as evidenced by factors such as:

        (A)  This includes an evaluation of matters such as age, educational level, and aptitude scores. Consideration may also be given to whether the individual met normal military standards of acceptability for military service and similar indicators of an individual's ability to serve satisfactorily, as well as ability to adjust to the military service.

        (B)  This includes matters in extenuation or mitigation of the reason for discharge that may have affected the applicant's ability to serve satisfactorily.

        (C)  This includes actions by individuals in authority which constitute a clear abuse of such authority and which, although not amounting to prejudicial error, may have contributed to the decision to discharge or to the characterization of service.

        (D)  This includes unauthorized acts as documented by records or other evidence.

        (a) Any offense may be prosecuted by a written information signed by the Island Attorney. However, if the offense is one for which issue of a citation is authorized by this part and a citation for the offense has been issued, the citation serves as an information.

The Court shall enter in the record of the case the plea made to each charge.

        (d) The accused may plead “guilty” to any or all of the charges against him, except that the Court may in its discretion refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and may not accept a plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.

        (e) The accused may plead “not guilty” to any or all of the charges against him. The Court shall enter a plea of not guilty if the answer of the accused to any charge is such that it does not clearly amount to a plea of guilty or not guilty.

        (f) The accused may, at any stage of the trial, with the consent of the Court, change a plea of not guilty to one of guilty. The Court shall then proceed as if the accused had originally pleaded guilty.

        § 935.104   Sentence after a plea of guilty.

#### § § 935.104

        If the Court accepts a plea of guilty to any charge or charges, it shall make a finding of guilty on that charge. Before imposing sentence, the Court shall hear such statements for the prosecution and defense, if any, as it requires to enable it to determine the sentence to be imposed. The accused or his counsel may make any reasonable statement he wishes in mitigation or of previous good character. The prosecution may introduce evidence in aggravation, or of bad character if the accused has introduced evidence of good character. The Court shall then impose any lawful sentence that it considers proper.

#### § § 935.105

        (a) If the accused pleads not guilty, he is entitled to a trial on the charges in accordance with procedures prescribed in the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the U.S. District Courts (18 U.S.C.), except as otherwise provided for in this part, to the extent the Court considers practicable and necessary to the ends of justice.

    PART 989—ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP)

### Part 989

**Authority:** Authority: 10 U.S.C. 8013.

**Source:** Source: 64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

      § 989.1   Purpose.

#### § § 989.1

      (a) This part implements the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and provides procedures for environmental impact analysis both within the United States and abroad. Because the authority for, and rules governing, each aspect of the EIAP differ depending on whether the action takes place in the United States or outside the United States, this part provides largely separate procedures for each type of action. Consequently, the main body of this part deals primarily with environmental impact analysis under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Public Law 91-190, 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 4321 through 4347), while the primary procedures for environmental impact analysis of actions outside the United States in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, are contained in §§ 989.37 and 989.38.

      (b) The procedures in this part are essential to achieve and maintain compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508, referred to as the “CEQ Regulations”). Further requirements are contained in Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 4715.1, Environmental Security, Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.9, Environmental Planning and Analysis, DoDD 5000.1, Defense Acquisition, and Department of Defense Regulation 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and Major Automated Information System Acquisition Programs.   To comply with NEPA and complete the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and this part must be used together.

      (c) Air Force activities abroad will comply with this part, E. O. 12114, and 32 CFR part 187 (DoDD 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, March 31, 1979). To comply with E.O. 12114 and complete the EIAP, the Executive Order, 32 CFR part 187, and this part must be used together.

      (d) Appendix A is a glossary of references, abbreviations, acronyms, and terms. Refer to 40 CFR 1508 for definitions of other terminology used in this part.

      § 989.2   Concept.

#### § § 989.2

      (a) This part provides a framework on how to comply with NEPA and E.O. 12114 according to Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70  . The Air Force specific procedures and requirements in this part are intended to be used by Air Force decision-makers to fully comply with NEPA and the EIAP.

      (b) Major commands (MAJCOM) provide additional implementing guidance in their supplemental publications to this part. MAJCOM supplements must identify the specific offices that have implementation responsibility and include any guidance needed to comply with this part. All references to MAJCOMs in this part include the Air National Guard Readiness Center (ANGRC) and other agencies designated as “MAJCOM equivalent” by HQ USAF.

      (b) Headquarters U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF). The Civil Engineer (HQ USAF/ILE) is responsible for execution of the EIAP program. The National Guard Bureau Air Directorate (NGB-CF) oversees the EIAP for Air National Guard actions.

      (c) MAJCOMs, the Air National Guard, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), and Single Manager Programs. These organizations establish procedures that comply with this part wherever they are the host unit for preparing and using required environmental documentation in making decisions about proposed actions and programs within their commands or areas of responsibility.

      (1) Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE). The AFCEE Technical Directorate, Built Infrastructure Division (AFCEE/TDB) is available to provide technical assistance and has the capability to provide contract support to the proponent, EPF, and MAJCOMs in developing EIAP documents.

      (2) Air Force Regional Environmental Offices (REOs). REOs review non-Air Force environmental documents that may have an impact on the Air Force. Requests for review of such documents should be directed to the proper REO (Atlanta, Dallas, or San Francisco) along with any relevant comments. The REO:

      (i) Notifies the proponent, after receipt, that the REO is the single point of contact for the Air Force review of the document.

      (ii) Requests comments from potentially affected installations, MAJCOMs, the ANG, and HQ USAF, as appropriate.

SAF/AQR, as the Air Force Acquisition Executive Office, is the final approval authority for all system-related NEPA documents. SAF/AQR is responsible for accomplishing appropriate Headquarters EPC/ESOHC review. The Single Manager will obtain appropriate Product Center EPC approval prior to forwarding necessary EIAP documents (i.e., Notices of Intent (NOIs) and preliminary draft and final EAs and EISs) to SAF/AQR. The Single Manager will allow for concurrent review of EIAP documents by HQ AFMC/CEV and the Operational Command (HQ ACC, HQ AMC, HQ AFSPC, etc.) The Single Manager is responsible for budgeting and funding EIAP efforts, including EIAP for research, development, testing, and evaluation activities.

      (4)  The EIAP must be approached as an integrated team effort including key participants within the Air Force and also involving outside federal agencies, state, Tribal, and local governments, interested outside parties, citizens groups, and the general public. Key Air Force participants may include the following functional areas, as well as others:

      (d)  Each office, unit, single manager, or activity at any level that initiates Air Force actions is responsible for:

      (1) Complying with the EIAP and shall ensure integration of the EIAP during the initial planning stages of proposed actions so that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, delays are avoided later in the process, and potential conflicts are precluded.

      (2) Notifying the EPF of a pending action and completing Section I of AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis. Prepare the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA) through an interdisciplinary team approach including the EPF and other key Air Force participants.

      (3) Identifying key decision points and coordinating with the EPF on EIAP phasing to ensure that environmental documents are available to the decision-maker before the final decision is made and ensuring that, until the EIAP is complete, resources are not committed prejudicing the selection of alternatives nor actions taken having an adverse environmental impact or limiting the choice of reasonable alternatives.

      (4) Determining, with the EPF, as early as possible whether to prepare an EIS. The proponent and the EPF will conduct an early internal scoping process as part of the EIAP process. The internal scoping process should involve key Air Force environmental participants (see § 989.3(c)(4)) and other Air Force offices as needed and conclude with preparation of a DOPAA. For complex or detailed EAs or EISs, an outside facilitator trained in EIAP may be used to focus and guide the discussion. Department of the Air Force personnel, rather than contractors, should generally be used to prepare the DOPAA.

      (5) Presenting the DOPAA to the EPC for review and comment.

      (6) Coordinating with the EPF, Public Affairs, and Staff Judge Advocate prior to organizing public or interagency meetings which deal with EIAP elements of a proposed action and involving persons or agencies outside the Air Force.

      § 989.4   Initial considerations.

#### § § 989.4

      Air Force personnel will:

      (a) Consider and document environmental effects of proposed Air Force actions through AF Forms 813, EAs, FONSIs, EISs, RODs, and documents prepared according to E.O. 12114.

      (b) Evaluate proposed actions for possible CATEX from environmental impact analysis (appendix B).

      (c) Make environmental documents, comments, and responses, including those of other federal agencies, state, Tribal, and local governments, and the public, part of the record available for review and use at all levels of decisionmaking.

      (d) Review the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIAP when evaluating the proposal prior to decisionmaking.

      (e) Ensure that alternatives to be considered by the decisionmaker are both reasonable and within the range of alternatives analyzed in the environmental documents.

      (f) Pursue the objective of furthering foreign policy and national security interests while at the same time considering important environmental factors.

      (g) Consider the environmental effects of actions that affect the global commons.

      (h) Determine whether any foreign government should be informed of the availability of environmental documents. Formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters and communications with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements will be coordinated with the Department of State by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI) through the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations & Environment). This coordination requirement does not apply to informal working-level communications and arrangements.

      § 989.5   Organizational relationships.

#### § § 989.5

      (a) The host EPF manages the EIAP using an interdisciplinary team approach. This is especially important for tenant-proposed actions, because the host command is responsible for the EIAP for actions related to the host command's installations.

      (b) The host command prepares environmental documents internally or directs the host base to prepare the environmental documents. Environmental document preparation may be by contract (requiring the tenant to fund the EIAP), by the tenant unit, or by the host. Regardless of the preparation method, the host command will ensure the required environmental analysis is accomplished before a decision is made on the proposal and an action is undertaken. Support agreements should provide specific procedures to ensure host oversight of tenant compliance, tenant funding or reimbursement of host EIAP costs, and tenant compliance with the EIAP regardless of the tenant not being an Air Force organization.

      (c) For aircraft beddown and unit realignment actions, program elements are identified in the Program Objective Memorandum. Subsequent Program Change Requests must include AF Form 813.

      (d) To ensure timely initiation of the EIAP, SAF/AQ forwards information copies of all Mission Need Statements and System Operational Requirements Documents to SAF/IEI, HQ USAF/A7CI (or NGB/A7CV), the Air Force Medical Operations Agency, Aerospace Medicine Office (AFMOA/SG), and the affected MAJCOM EPFs.

      (e) The MAJCOM of the scheduling unit managing affected airspace is responsible for preparing and approving environmental analyses.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007; 79 FR 35286, June 20, 2014]

      § 989.6   Budgeting and funding.

#### § § 989.6

      Contract EIAP efforts are proponent MAJCOM responsibilities. Each year, the EPF programs for anticipated out-year EIAP workloads based on inputs from command proponents. If proponent offices exceed the budget in a given year or identify unforeseen requirements, the proponent offices must provide the remaining funding.

      § 989.7   Requests from Non-Air Force agencies or entities.

#### § § 989.7

      (a) Non-Air Force agencies or entities may request the Air Force to undertake an action, such as issuing a permit or outleasing Air Force property, that may primarily benefit the requester or an agency other than the Air Force. The EPF and other Air Force staff elements must identify such requests and coordinate with the proponent of the non-Air Force proposal, as well as with concerned state, Tribal, and local governments.

      (b) Air Force decisions on such proposals must take into consideration the potential environmental impacts of the applicant's proposed activity (as described in an Air Force environmental document), insofar as the proposed action involves Air Force property or programs, or requires Air Force approval.

      (c) The Air Force may require the requester to prepare, at the requester's expense, an analysis of environmental impacts (40 CFR 1506.5), or the requester may be required to pay for an EA or EIS to be prepared by a contractor selected and supervised by the Air Force. The EPF may permit requesters to submit draft EAs for their proposed actions, except for actions described in § 989.16(a) and (b), or for actions the EPF has reason to believe will ultimately require an EIS. For EISs, the EPF has the responsibility to prepare the environmental document, although responsibility for funding remains with the requester. The fact that the requester has prepared environmental documents at its own expense does not commit the Air Force to allow or undertake the proposed action or its alternatives. The requester is not entitled to any preference over other potential parties with whom the Air Force might contract or make similar arrangements.

      (d) In no event is the requester who prepares or funds an environmental analysis entitled to reimbursement from the Air Force. When requesters prepare environmental documents outside the Air Force, the Air Force must independently evaluate and approve the scope and content of the environmental analyses before using the analyses to fulfill EIAP requirements. Any outside environmental analysis must evaluate reasonable alternatives as defined in § 989.8.

      § 989.8   Analysis of alternatives.

#### § § 989.8

      (a) The Air Force must analyze reasonable alternatives to the proposed action and the “no action” alternative in all EAs and EISs, as fully as the proposed action alternative.

      (b) “Reasonable” alternatives are those that meet the underlying purpose and need for the proposed action and that would cause a reasonable person to inquire further before choosing a particular course of action. Reasonable alternatives are not limited to those directly within the power of the Air Force to implement. They may involve another government agency or military service to assist in the project or even to become the lead agency. The Air Force must also consider reasonable alternatives raised during the scoping process (see § 989.18) or suggested by others, as well as combinations of alternatives. The Air Force need not analyze highly speculative alternatives, such as those requiring a major, unlikely change in law or governmental policy. If the Air Force identifies a large number of reasonable alternatives, it may limit alternatives selected for detailed environmental analysis to a reasonable range or to a reasonable number of examples covering the full spectrum of alternatives.

      (c) The Air Force may expressly eliminate alternatives from detailed analysis, based on reasonable selection standards (for example, operational, technical, or environmental standards suitable to a particular project). In consultation with the EPF, the appropriate Air Force organization may develop written selection standards to firmly establish what is a “reasonable” alternative for a particular project, but they must not so narrowly define these standards that they unnecessarily limit consideration to the proposal initially favored by proponents. This discussion of reasonable alternatives applies equally to EAs and EISs.

      (d) Except in those rare instances where excused by law, the Air Force must always consider and assess the environmental impacts of the “no action” alternative. “No action” may mean either that current management practice will not change or that the proposed action will not take place. If no action would result in other predictable actions, those actions should be discussed within the no action alternative section. The discussion of the no action alternative and the other alternatives should be comparable in detail to that of the proposed action.

      § 989.9   Cooperation and adoption.

#### § § 989.9

      (a)  When the Air Force is a cooperating agency in the preparation of an EIS, the Air Force reviews and approves principal environmental documents within the EIAP as if they were prepared by the Air Force. The Air Force executes a ROD for its program decisions that are based on an EIS for which the Air Force is a cooperating agency. The Air Force may also be a lead or cooperating agency on an EA using similar procedures, but the MAJCOM EPC retains approval authority unless otherwise directed by HQ USAF. Before invoking provisions of 40 CFR 1501.5(e), the lowest authority level possible resolves disputes concerning which agency is the lead agency.

      (b)  The Air Force, even though not a cooperating agency, may adopt an EA or EIS prepared by another entity where the proposed action is substantially the same as the action described in the EA or EIS. In this case, the EA or EIS must be recirculated as a final EA or EIS but the Air Force must independently review the EA or EIS and determine that it is current and that it satisfies the requirements of this part. The Air Force then prepares its own FONSI or ROD, as the case may be. In the situation where the proposed action is not substantially the same as that described in the EA or the EIS, the Air Force may adopt the EA or EIS, or a portion thereof, by circulating the EA or EIS as a draft and then preparing the final EA or EIS.

      § 989.10   Tiering.

#### § § 989.10

      The Air Force should use tiered (40 CFR 1502.20) environmental documents, and environmental documents prepared by other agencies, to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the issues relating to specific actions. If the Air Force adopts another Federal agency's environmental document, subsequent Air Force environmental documents may also be tiered.

      § 989.11   Combining EIAP with other documentation.

#### § § 989.11

      (a) The EPF combines environmental analysis with other related documentation when practicable (40 CFR 1506.4) following the procedures prescribed by the CEQ regulations and this part.

      (b) The EPF must integrate comprehensive planning (AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning  ) with the requirements of the EIAP. Prior to making a decision to proceed, the EPF must analyze the environmental impacts that could result from implementation of a proposal identified in the comprehensive plan.

      § 989.12   AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis.

#### § § 989.12

      The Air Force uses AF Form 813 to document the need for environmental analysis or for certain CATEX determinations for proposed actions. The form helps narrow and focus the issues to potential environmental impacts. AF Form 813 must be retained with the EA or EIS to record the focusing of environmental issues.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001]

      § 989.13   Categorical exclusion.

#### § § 989.13

      (a) CATEXs define those categories of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have potential for significant effect on the environment and do not, therefore, require further environmental analysis in an EA or an EIS. The list of Air Force-approved CATEXs is in appendix B. Supplements to this part may not add CATEXs or expand the scope of the CATEXs in appendix B.

      (b) Characteristics of categories of actions that usually do not require either an EIS or an EA (in the absence of extraordinary circumstances) include:

      (1) Minimal adverse effect on environmental quality.

      (2) No significant change to existing environmental conditions.

      (3) No significant cumulative environmental impact.

      (4) Socioeconomic effects only.

      (5) Similarity to actions previously assessed and found to have no significant environmental impacts.

      (c) CATEXs apply to actions in the United States and abroad. General exemptions specific to actions abroad are in 32 CFR part 187. The EPF or other decision-maker forwards requests for additional exemption determinations for actions abroad to HQ USAF/A7CI with a justification letter.

      (d) Normally, any decision-making level may determine the applicability of a CATEX and need not formally record the determination on AF Form 813 or elsewhere, except as noted in the CATEX list.

      (e) Application of a CATEX to an action does not eliminate the need to meet air conformity requirements (see § 989.30).

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007]

      § 989.14   Environmental assessment.

#### § § 989.14

      (a) When a proposed action is one not usually requiring an EIS but is not categorically excluded, the EPF supports the proponent in preparing an EA (40 CFR 1508.9). Every EA must lead to either a FONSI, a decision to prepare an EIS, or no action on the proposal.

      (b) Whenever a proposed action usually requires an EIS, the EPF responsible for the EIAP may prepare an EA to definitively determine if an EIS is required based on the analysis of environmental impacts. Alternatively, the EPF may choose to bypass the EA and proceed with preparation of an EIS.

      (c) An EA is a written analysis that:

      (1) Provides analysis sufficient to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI.

      (2) Aids the Air Force in complying with the NEPA when no EIS is required.

      (d) The length of an EA should be as short and concise as possible, while matching the magnitude of the proposal. An EA briefly discusses the need for the proposed action, reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, the affected environment, the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives (including the “no action” alternative), and a listing of agencies and persons consulted during preparation. The EA should not contain long descriptions or lengthy, detailed data. Rather, incorporate by reference background data to support the concise discussion of the proposal and relevant issues.

      (e) The format for the EA may be the same as the EIS. The alternatives section of an EA and an EIS are similar and should follow the alternatives analysis guidance outlined in § 989.8.

      (f) The EPF should design the EA to facilitate rapidly transforming the document into an EIS if the environmental analysis reveals a significant impact.

      (g) As a finding contained in the draft FONSI, a Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA) must be submitted (five hard copies and an electronic version) to the MAJCOM EPF when the alternative selected could be located in wetlands or floodplains, and must discuss why no other practicable alternative exists to avoid impacts. See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management.

      (h) EAs and accompanying FONSIs that require the Air Force to make Clean Air Act General Conformity Determinations shall be submitted (five hard copies and an electronic version) through the MAJCOM EPF to HQ USAF/A7CI for SAF/IEE coordination. SAF/IEE signs all General Conformity Determinations; SAF/IEI will sign the companion FONSIs after coordination with SAF/IEE, when requested by the MAJCOM (see § 989.30).

      (i) In cases potentially involving a high degree of controversy or Air Force-wide concern, the MAJCOM, after consultation with HQ USAF/A7CI, may request HQ USAF ESOHC review and approval of an EA, or HQ USAF may direct the MAJCOM to forward an EA (five hard copies and an electronic version) for HQ USAF ESOHC review and approval.

      (j) As a minimum, the following EAs require MAJCOM approval because they involve topics of special importance or interest. Unless directed otherwise by HQ USAF/A7CI, the installation EPF must forward the following types of EAs to the MAJCOM EPF, along with an unsigned draft FONSI: (MAJCOMs can require other EAs to receive MAJCOM approval in addition to those types specified here.)

      (1) All EAs on non-Air Force proposals that require an Air Force decision, such as use of Air Force property for highways, space ports, and joint-use proposals.

      (2) EAs where mitigation to insignificance is accomplished in lieu of initiating an EIS (§ 989.22(c)).

      (k) A few examples of actions that normally require preparation of an EA (except as indicated in the CATEX list) include:

      (1) Public land withdrawals of less than 5,000 acres.

      (2) Minor mission realignments and aircraft beddowns.

      (3) New building construction on base within developed areas.

      (4) Minor modifications to Military Operating Areas (MOAs), air-to-ground weapons ranges, and military training routes.

      (l) The Air Force will involve other federal agencies, state, Tribal, and local governments, and the public in the preparation of EAs (40 CFR 1501.4(b) and 1506.6). The extent of involvement usually coincides with the magnitude and complexity of the proposed action and its potential environmental effect on the area. For proposed actions described in § 989.15(e)(2), use either the scoping process described in § 989.18 or the public notice process in § 989.24.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007; 79 FR 35286, June 20, 2014]

      § 989.15   Finding of no significant impact.

#### § § 989.15

      (a) The FONSI (40 CFR 1508.13) briefly describes why an action would not have a significant effect on the environment and thus will not be the subject of an EIS. The FONSI must summarize the EA or, preferably, have it attached and incorporated by reference, and must note any other environmental documents related to the action.

      (b) If the EA is not incorporated by reference, the FONSI must include:

      (1) Name of the action.

      (2) Brief description of the action (including alternatives considered and the chosen alternative).

      (3) Brief discussion of anticipated environmental effects.

      (4) Conclusions leading to the FONSI.

      (5) All mitigation actions that will be adopted with implementation of the proposal (see § 989.22).

      (c) Keep FONSIs as brief as possible. Only rarely should FONSIs exceed two typewritten pages. Stand-alone FONSIs without an attached EA may be longer.

      (d) For actions of regional or local interest, disseminate the FONSI according to § 989.24. The MAJCOM and NGB are responsible for release of FONSIs to regional offices of Federal agencies, the state single point of contact (SPOC), and state agencies concurrent with local release by the installations.

      (e) The EPF must make the EA and unsigned FONSI available to the affected public and provide the EA and unsigned FONSI to organizations and individuals requesting them and to whomever the proponent or the EPF has reason to believe is interested in the action, unless disclosure is precluded for security classification reasons. Draft EAs and unsigned draft FONSIs will be clearly identified as drafts and distributed via cover letter which will explain their purpose and need. The EPF provides a copy of the documents without cost to organizations and individuals requesting them. The FONSI transmittal date (date of letter of transmittal) to the state SPOC or other equivalent agency is the official notification date.

      (1) Before the FONSI is signed and the action is implemented, the EPF should allow sufficient time to receive comments from the public. The time period will reflect the magnitude of the proposed action and its potential for controversy. The greater the magnitude of the proposed action or its potential for controversy, the longer the time that must be allowed for public review. Mandatory review periods for certain defined actions are contained in § 989.15(e)(2). These are not all inclusive but merely specific examples. In every case where an EA and FONSI are prepared, the proponent and EPF must determine how much time will be allowed for public review. In all cases, other than classified actions, a public review period should be the norm unless clearly unnecessary due to the lack of potential controversy.

      (2) In the following circumstances, the EA and unsigned FONSI are made available for public review for at least 30 days before FONSI approval and implementing the action (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)):

      (i) When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that usually requires preparation of an EIS (see § 989.16).

      (ii) If it is an unusual case, a new kind of action, or a precedent-setting case in terms of its potential environmental impacts.

      (iii) If the proposed action would be located in a floodplain or wetland.

      (iv) If the action is mitigated to insignificance in the FONSI, in lieu of an EIS (§ 989.22(c)).

      (v) If the proposed action is a change to airspace use or designation.

      (vi) If the proposed action would have a disproportionately high and adverse environmental effect on minority populations and low-income populations.

      (f) As a general rule, the same organizational level that prepares the EA also reviews and recommends the FONSI for approval by the EPC. MAJCOMs may decide the level of EA approval and FONSI signature, except as provided in § 989.14(g), (h), (i), and (j).

      § 989.16   Environmental impact statement.

#### § § 989.16

      (a) Certain classes of environmental impacts normally require preparation of an EIS (40 CFR 1501.4). These include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Potential for significant degradation of the environment.

      (2) Potential for significant threat or hazard to public health or safety.

      (3) Substantial environmental controversy concerning the significance or nature of the environmental impact of a proposed action.

      (b) Certain other actions normally, but not always, require an EIS. These include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Public land withdrawals of over 5,000 acres (Engle Act, 43 U.S.C. 155 through 158).

      (2) Establishment of new air-to-ground weapons ranges.

      (3) Site selection of new airfields.

      (4) Site selection of major installations.

      (5) Development of major new weapons systems (at decision points that involve demonstration, validation, production, deployment, and area or site selection for deployment).

      (6) Establishing or expanding supersonic training areas over land below 30,000 feet MSL (mean sea level).

      (7) Disposal and reuse of closing installations.

      § 989.17   Notice of intent.

#### § § 989.17

      The EPF must furnish, through the MAJCOM, to HQ USAF/A7CI the NOI (40 CFR 1508.22) describing the proposed action for congressional notification and publication in the  The EPF, through the host base public affairs office, will also provide the approved NOI to newspapers and other media in the area potentially affected by the proposed action. The EPF must provide copies of the notice to the SPOC and must also distribute it to requesting agencies, organizations, and individuals. Along with the draft NOI, the EPF must also forward the completed DOPAA, through the MAJCOM, to HQ USAF for information.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007]

      § 989.18   Scoping.

#### § § 989.18

      (a) After publication of the NOI for an EIS, the EPF must initiate the public scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7) to determine the scope of issues to be addressed and to help identify significant environmental issues to be analyzed in depth. Methods of scoping range from soliciting written comments to conducting public scoping meetings (see 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1506.6(e)). The scoping process is an iterative, pro-active process of communicating with individual citizens, neighborhood, community, and local leaders, public interest groups, congressional delegations, state, Tribal, and local governments, and federal agencies. The scoping process must start prior to official public scoping meetings and continue through to preparation of the draft EIS. The purpose of this process is to de-emphasize insignificant issues and focus the scope of the environmental analysis on significant issues (40 CFR 1500.4(g)). Additionally, scoping allows early and more meaningful participation by the public. The result of scoping is that the proponent and EPF determine the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to be considered in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). The EPF must send scripts for scoping meetings to HQ USAF/A7CI (or ANGRC/CEV) no later than 30 days before the first scoping meeting. Scoping meeting plans are similar in content to public hearing plans (see appendix C). Public scoping meetings should generally be held at locations not on the installation.

      (b) Where it is anticipated the proposed action and its alternatives will have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations or low-income populations, special efforts shall be made to reach these populations. This might include special informational meetings or notices in minority and low-income areas concerning the regular scoping process.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 66 FR 26793, May 15, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007]

      § 989.19   Draft EIS.

#### § § 989.19

      (a)  The EPF supports the proponent in preparation of a preliminary draft EIS (PDEIS) (40 CFR 1502.9) based on the scope of issues decided on during the scoping process. The format of the EIS must be in accordance with the format recommended in the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 and 1502.11). The CEQ regulations indicate that EISs normally contain fewer than 150 pages (300 pages for proposals of unusual complexity). The EPF provides a sufficient number of copies of the PDEIS to HQ USAF/A7CI for HQ USAF ESOHC security and policy review in each member's area of responsibility and to AFCEE/TDB for technical review.

      (b)  After the HQ USAF ESOHC review, the EPF assists the appropriate Air Force organization in making any necessary revisions to the PDEIS and forwards it to HQ USAF/A7CI as a draft EIS to ensure completion of all security and policy reviews and to certify releasability. Once the draft EIS is approved, HQ USAF/A7CI notifies the EPF to print sufficient copies of the draft EIS for distribution to congressional delegations and interested agencies at least 7 calendar days prior to publication of the Notice of Availability (NOA) in the  After congressional distribution, the EPF sends the draft EIS to all others on the distribution list. HQ USAF/A7CI then files the document with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and provides a copy to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security.

      (c)  (1) The public comment period for the draft EIS is at least 45 days starting from the publication date of the NOA of the draft EIS in the  USEPA publishes in the  NOAs of EISs filed during the preceding week. This public comment period may be extended by the EPF. If the draft EIS is unusually long, the EPF may distribute a summary to the public with an attached list of locations (such as public libraries) where the entire draft EIS may be reviewed. The EPF must distribute the full draft EIS to certain entities, for example, agencies with jurisdiction by law or agencies with special expertise in evaluating the environmental impacts, and anyone else requesting the entire draft EIS (40 CFR 1502.19 and 1506.6).

      (2) The EPF sponsors public hearings on the draft EIS according to the procedures in appendix C to this part. Hearings take place no sooner than 15 days after the  publication of the NOA and at least 15 days before the end of the comment period. Scheduling hearings toward the end of the comment period is encouraged to allow the public to obtain and more thoroughly review the draft EIS. The EPF must provide hearing scripts to HQ USAF/A7CI (or ANGRC/CEV) no later than 30 days prior to the first public hearing. Public hearings should generally be held at off-base locations. Submit requests to deviate from procedures in appendix C to this part to HQ USAF/A7CI for SAF/IEI approval.

      (3) Where analyses indicate that a proposed action will potentially have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations or low-income populations, the EPF should make special efforts to ensure that these potentially impacted populations are brought into the review process.

      (d)  The EPF must incorporate in the Final EIS its responses to comments on the Draft EIS by modifying the text and referring in the appendix to where the comment is addressed or providing a written explanation in the comments section, or both. The EPF may group comments of a similar nature together to allow a common response and may also respond to individuals separately.

      (e)  The EPF may, at any time during the EIS process, seek additional public comments, such as when there has been a significant change in circumstances, development of significant new information of a relevant nature, or where there is substantial environmental controversy concerning the proposed action. Significant new information leading to public controversy regarding the scope after the scoping process is such a changed circumstance. An additional public comment period may also be necessary after the publication of the draft EIS due to public controversy or changes made as the result of previous public comments. Such periods when additional public comments are sought shall last for at least 30 days.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007; 79 FR 35286, June 20, 2014]

      § 989.20   Final EIS.

#### § § 989.20

      (a) If changes in the draft EIS are minor or limited to factual corrections and responses to comments, the proponent and EPF may, with the prior approval of HQ USAF/A7CI and SAF/IEI, prepare a document containing only comments on the Draft EIS, Air Force responses, and errata sheets of changes staffed to the HQ USAF ESOHC for coordination. However, the EPF must submit the Draft EIS and all of the above documents, with a new cover sheet indicating that it is a final EIS (40 CFR 1503.4(c)), to HQ USAF/A7CI for filing with the EPA (40 CFR 1506.9). If more extensive modifications are required, the EPF must prepare a preliminary final EIS incorporating these modifications for coordination within the Air Force. Regardless of which procedure is followed, the final EIS must be processed in the same way as the draft EIS, including receipt of copies of the EIS by SAF/LLP, except that the public need not be invited to comment during the 30-day post-filing waiting period. The Final EIS should be furnished to every person, organization, or agency that made substantive comments on the Draft EIS or requested a copy. Although the EPF is not required to respond to public comments received during this period, comments received must be considered in determining final decisions such as identifying the preferred alternative, appropriate mitigations, or if a supplemental analysis is required.

      (b) The EPF processes all necessary supplements to EISs (40 CFR 1502.9) in the same way as the original Draft and Final EIS, except that a new scoping process is not required.

      (c) If major steps to advance the proposal have not occurred within 5 years from the date of the Final EIS approval, reevaluation of the documentation should be accomplished to ensure its continued validity.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16868, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37106, July 9, 2007; 79 FR 35287, June 20, 2014]

      § 989.21   Record of decision (ROD).

#### § § 989.21

      (a) The proponent and the EPF prepare a draft ROD, formally staff it through the MAJCOM EPC, to HQ USAF/A7CI for verification of adequacy, and forwards it to either SAF/IEI or SAF/AQR, as the case may be, for approval and designation of the signator. A ROD (40 CFR 1505.2) is a concise public document stating what an agency's decision is on a specific action. The ROD may be integrated into any other document required to implement the agency's decision. A decision on a course of action may not be made until the later of the following dates:

      (1) 90 days after publication of the DEIS; or

      (2) 30 days after publication of the NOA of the Final EIS in the

      (b) The Air Force must announce the ROD to the affected public as specified in § 989.24, except for classified portions. The ROD should be concise and should explain the conclusion, the reason for the selection, and the alternatives considered. The ROD must identify the course of action, whether it is the proposed action or an alternative, that is considered environmentally preferable regardless of whether it is the alternative selected for implementation. The ROD should summarize all the major factors the agency weighed in making its decision, including essential considerations of national policy.

      (c) The ROD must state whether the selected alternative employs all practicable means to avoid, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts and, if not, explain why not.

      § 989.22   Mitigation.

#### § § 989.22

      (a) When preparing EIAP documents, indicate clearly whether mitigation measures (40 CFR 1508.20) must be implemented for the alternative selected. If using Best Management Practices (BMPs), identify the specific BMPs being used and include those BMPs in the mitigation plan. Discuss mitigation measures in terms of “will” and “would” when such measures have already been incorporated into the proposal. Use terms like “may” and “could” when proposing or suggesting mitigation measures. Both the public and the Air Force community need to know what commitments are being considered and selected, and who will be responsible for implementing, funding, and monitoring the mitigation measures.

      (b) The proponent funds and implements mitigation measures in the mitigation plan that is approved by the decision-maker. Where possible and appropriate because of amount, the proponent should include the cost of mitigation as a line item in the budget for a proposed project. The proponent must ensure compliance with mitigation requirements, monitoring their effectiveness, and must keep the EPF informed of the mitigation status. The EPF reports its status, through the MAJCOM, to HQ USAF/A7CI when requested. Upon request, the EPF must also provide the results of relevant mitigation monitoring to the public.

      (c) The proponent may “mitigate to insignificance” potentially significant environmental impacts found during preparation of an EA, in lieu of preparing an EIS. The FONSI for the EA must include these mitigation measures. Such mitigations are legally binding and must be carried out as the proponent implements the project. If, for any reason, the project proponent later abandons or revises in environmentally adverse ways the mitigation commitments made in the FONSI, the proponent must prepare a supplemental EIAP document before continuing the project. If potentially significant environmental impacts would result from any project revisions, the proponent must prepare an EIS.

      (d) For each FONSI or ROD containing mitigation measures, the proponent prepares a plan specifically identifying each mitigation, discussing how the proponent will execute the mitigations, identifying who will fund and implement the mitigations, and stating when the proponent will complete the mitigation. The mitigation plan will be forwarded, through the MAJCOM EPF to HQ USAF/A7CI for review within 90 days from the date of signature of the FONSI or ROD.

      (a) Except as provided in § 989.26, public notification is required for various aspects of the EIAP.

      (b) Activities that require public notification include:

      (1) An EA and FONSI.

      (2) An EIS NOI.

      (3) Public scoping meetings.

      (4) Availability of the draft EIS.

      (5) Public hearings on the draft EIS (which should be included in the NOA for the draft EIS).

      (6) Availability of the final EIS.

      (7) The ROD for an EIS.

      (c) For actions of local concern, the list of possible notification methods in 40 CFR 1506.6(b)(3) is only illustrative. The EPF may use other equally effective means of notification as a substitute for any of the methods listed. Because many Air Force actions are of limited interest to persons or organizations outside the Air Force, the EPF may limit local notification to the SPOC, local government representatives, and local news media. For all actions covered under § 989.15(e)(2), and for all EIS notices, the public affairs office must purchase with EPF funds an advertisement in a prominent section of the local newspaper(s) of general circulation (not “legal” newspapers or “legal section” of general newspapers).

      (d) For the purpose of EIAP, the EPF begins the time period of local notification when it sends written notification to the state SPOC or other equivalent agency (date of letter of notification).

      § 989.25   Base closure and realignment.

#### § § 989.25

      Base closure or realignment may entail special requirements for environmental analysis. The permanent base closure and realignment law, 10 U.S.C. 2687, requires a report to the Congress when an installation where at least 300 DoD civilian personnel are authorized to be employed is closed, or when a realignment reduces such an installation by at least 50 percent or 1,000 of such personnel, whichever is less. In addition, other base closure laws may be in effect during particular periods. Such nonpermanent closure laws frequently contain provisions limiting the extent of environmental analysis required for actions taken under them. Such provisions may also add requirements for studies not necessarily required by NEPA.

      § 989.26   Classified actions (40 CFR 1507.3(c)).

#### § § 989.26

      (a) Classification of an action for national defense or foreign policy purposes does not relieve the requirement of complying with NEPA. In classified matters, the Air Force must prepare and make available normal NEPA environmental analysis documents to aid in the decision-making process; however, Air Force staff must prepare, safeguard, and disseminate these documents according to established procedures for protecting classified documents. If an EIAP document must be classified, the Air Force may modify or eliminate associated requirements for public notice (including publication in the ) or public involvement in the EIAP. However, the Air Force should obtain comments on classified proposed actions or classified aspects of generally unclassified actions, from public agencies having jurisdiction by law or special expertise, to the extent that such review and comment is consistent with security requirements. Where feasible, the EPF may need to help appropriate personnel from those agencies obtain necessary security clearances to gain access to documents so they can comment on scoping or review the documents.

      (b) Where the proposed action is classified and unavailable to the public, the Air Force may keep the entire NEPA process classified and protected under the applicable procedures for the classification level pertinent to the particular information. At times (for example, during weapons system development and base closures and realignments), certain but not all aspects of NEPA documents may later be declassified. In those cases, the EPF should organize the EIAP documents, to the extent practicable, in a way that keeps the most sensitive classified information (which is not expected to be released at any early date) in a separate annex that can remain classified; the rest of the EIAP documents, when declassified, will then be comprehensible as a unit and suitable for release to the public. Thus, the documents will reflect, as much as possible, the nature of the action and its environmental impacts, as well as Air Force compliance with NEPA requirements.

      (c) Where the proposed action is not classified, but certain aspects of it need to be protected by security classification, the EPF should tailor the EIAP for a proposed action to permit as normal a level of public involvement as possible, but also fully protect the classified part of the action and environmental analysis. In some instances, the EPF can do this by keeping the classified sections of the EIAP documents in a separate, classified annex.

      (d) For § 989.26(b) actions, an NOI or NOA will not be published in the  until the proposed action is declassified. For § 989.26(c) actions, the  will run an unclassified NOA which will advise the public that at some time in the future the Air Force may or will publicly release a declassified document.

      (e) The EPF similarly protects classified aspects of FONSIs, RODs, or other environmental documents that are part of the EIAP for a proposed action, such as by preparing separate classified annexes to unclassified documents, as necessary.

      (f) Whenever a proponent believes that EIAP documents should be kept classified, the EPF must make a report of the matter to SAF/IEI, including proposed modifications of the normal EIAP to protect classified information. The EPF may make such submissions at whatever level of security classification is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues. SAF/IEI, with support from SAF/GC and other staff elements as necessary, makes final decisions on EIAP procedures for classified actions.

      § 989.27   Occupational safety and health.

#### § § 989.27

      Assess direct and indirect impacts of proposed actions on the safety and health of Air Force employees and others at a work site. The EIAP document does not need to specify compliance procedures. However, the EIAP documents should discuss impacts that require a change in work practices to achieve an adequate level of health and safety.

      § 989.28   Airspace and range proposals.

#### § § 989.28

      (a)  Airspace and range proposals require review by HQ USAF/XOO prior to public announcement and preparation of the DOPAA. Unless directed otherwise, the airspace proponent will forward the DOPAA as an attachment to the proposal sent to HQ USAF/XOO.

      (b)  The DoD and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines various airspace responsibilities. For purposes of compliance with NEPA, the DoD is the “lead agency” for all proposals initiated by DoD, with the FAA acting as the “cooperating agency.” Where airspace proposals initiated by the FAA affect military use, the roles are reversed. The proponent's action officers (civil engineering and local airspace management) must ensure that the FAA is fully integrated into the airspace proposal and related EIAP from the very beginning and that the action officers review the FAA's responsibilities as a cooperating agency. The proponent's airspace manager develops the preliminary airspace proposal per appropriate FAA handbooks and the FAA-DoD MOU. The preliminary airspace proposal is the basis for initial dialogue between DoD and the FAA on the proposed action. A close working relationship between DoD and the FAA, through the FAA regional Air Force representative, greatly facilitates the airspace proposal process and helps resolve many NEPA issues during the EIAP.

      § 989.29   Force structure and unit move proposals.

#### § § 989.29

      Unless directed otherwise, the MAJCOM plans and programs proponent will forward a copy of all EAs for force structure and unit moves to HQ USAF/A7CI for information only at the preliminary draft and preliminary final stages.

      § 989.30   Air quality.

#### § § 989.30

      Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 7506(c), establishes a conformity requirement for Federal agencies which has been implemented by regulation, 40 CFR 93, subpart  B. All EIAP documents must address applicable conformity requirements and the status of compliance. Conformity applicability analyses and determinations are developed in parallel with EIAP documents, but are separate and distinct requirements and should be documented separately. To increase the utility of a conformity determination in performing the EIAP, the conformity determination should be completed prior to the completion of the EIAP so as to allow incorporation of the information from the conformity determination into the EIAP. See AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance.

      § 989.31   Pollution prevention.

#### § § 989.31

      The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13101(b), established a national policy to prevent or reduce pollution at the source, whenever feasible. Pollution prevention approaches should be applied to all pollution-generating activities. The environmental document should analyze potential pollution that may result from the proposed action and alternatives and must discuss potential pollution prevention measures when such measures are feasible for incorporation into the proposal or alternatives. Where pollution cannot be prevented, the environmental analysis and proposed mitigation measures should include, wherever possible, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and environmentally safe disposal actions (see AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program  ).

      § 989.32   Noise.

#### § § 989.32

      Aircraft noise data files used for analysis during EIAP will be submitted to HQ AFCEE for review and validation prior to public release, and upon completion of the EIAP for database entry. Utilize the current NOISEMAP computer program for air installations and the Assessment System for Aircraft Noise for military training routes and military operating areas. Guidance on standardized Air Force noise data development and analysis procedures is available from HQ AFCEE/TDB. Develop EIAP land use analysis relating to aircraft noise impacts originating from air installations following procedures in AFI 32-7063, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program. Draft EIAP aircraft noise/land use analysis associated with air installations will be coordinated with the MAJCOM AICUZ program manager.

      § 989.33   Environmental justice.

#### § § 989.33

      During the preparation of environmental analyses under this instruction, the EPF should ensure compliance with the provisions of E.O. 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, and Executive Memorandum of February 11, 1994, regarding E.O. 12898.

      § 989.34   Special and emergency procedures.

#### § § 989.34

      (a)  During the EIAP, unique situations may arise that require EIAP strategies different than those set forth in this part. These situations may warrant modification of the procedures in this part. EPFs should only consider procedural deviations when the resulting process would benefit the Air Force and still comply with NEPA and CEQ regulations. EPFs must forward all requests for procedural deviations to HQ USAF/A7CI (or ANGRC/CEV) for review and approval by SAF/IEI.

      (b)  Emergency situations do not exempt the Air Force from complying with NEPA, but do allow emergency response while completing the EIAP. Certain emergency situations may make it necessary to take immediate action having significant environmental impact, without observing all the provisions of the CEQ regulations or this part. If possible, promptly notify HQ USAF/A7CI, for SAF/IEI coordination and CEQ consultation .The immediate notification requirement does not apply where emergency action must be taken without delay. Coordination in this instance must take place as soon as practicable.

      § 989.35   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 989.35

      (a) EAs, EISs, and mitigation measures will be tracked at bases and MAJCOMs through an appropriate environmental management system.

      (b) Proponents, EPFs, and public affairs offices may utilize the World Wide Web, in addition to more traditional means, to notify the public of availability of EAs and EISs. When possible, allow distribution of documents electronically. Public review comments should be required in writing, rather than by electronic mail.

      (c) All documentation will be disposed of according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

      § 989.36   Waivers.

#### § § 989.36

      In order to deal with unusual circumstances and to allow growth in the EIAP process, SAF/IEI may grant waivers to those procedures contained in this part not required by NEPA or the CEQ Regulations. Such waivers shall not be used to limit compliance with NEPA or the CEQ Regulations but only to substitute other, more suitable procedures relative to the context of the particular action. Such waivers may also be granted on occasion to allow experimentation in procedures in order to allow growth in the EIAP. This authority may not be delegated.

> [64 FR 38129, July 15, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 16869, Mar. 28, 2001; 72 FR 37107, July 9, 2007; 79 FR 35287, June 20, 2014]

      § 989.37   Procedures for analysis abroad.

#### § § 989.37

      Procedures for analysis of environmental actions abroad are contained in 32 CFR part 187. That directive provides comprehensive policies, definitions, and procedures for implementing E.O. 12114. For analysis of Air Force actions abroad, 32 CFR part 187 will be followed.

      § 989.38   Requirements for analysis abroad.

#### § § 989.38

      (a) The EPF will generally perform the same functions for analysis of actions abroad that it performs in the United States. In addition to the requirements of 32 CFR part 187, the following Air Force specific rules apply:

      (b) For EAs dealing with global commons (geographic areas beyond the jurisdiction of the United States or any foreign nation), HQ USAF/A7CI will review actions that are above the MAJCOM approval authority. In this instance, approval authority refers to the same approval authority that would apply to an EA in the United States. The EPF documents a decision not to do an EIS.

      (c) For EISs dealing with the global commons, the EPF provides sufficient copies to HQ USAF/A7CI for the HQ USAF ESOHC review and AFCEE/TDB technical review. After ESOHC review, the EPF makes a recommendation as to whether the proposed draft EIS will be released as a draft EIS.

      (d) For environmental studies and environmental reviews, forward, when appropriate, environmental studies and reviews to HQ USAF/A7CI for coordination among appropriate federal agencies. HQ USAF/A7CI makes environmental studies and reviews available to the Department of State and other interested federal agencies, and, on request, to the United States public, in accordance with 32 CFR part 187. HQ USAF/A7CI also may inform interested foreign governments or furnish copies of studies, in accordance with 32 CFR part 187.
