    Subpart A—General

      § 25.100   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 25.100

      This part provides guidance to Federal agencies that:

      (a) The unique entity identifier (UEI) is the universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct subrecipients (first-tier subrecipients), and;

      (b) The System for Award Management () is the repository for standard information about applicants and recipients.

      § 25.105   Applicability.

#### § § 25.105

      (a) This part applies to a Federal agency's Federal financial assistance as defined in § 25.400. This part applies to all applicants for and recipients of Federal financial assistance unless exempted by Federal statute or § 25.110.

      (b) Subrecipients are required to obtain a UEI in accordance with subpart C. This part does not apply to subrecipients of subrecipients (second-tier subrecipients) or contractors under Federal awards.

      (c) This part does not apply to an individual who applies for or receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person (unrelated to any business or nonprofit organization an individual owns or operates).

      (d) Because this part applies to loan guarantees and other guaranteed programs, recipients of the guarantee from the Federal agency (for example, lenders of guaranteed loans) are required to complete entity validations and acquire a UEI. Additionally, at the Federal agency's discretion, non-individual beneficiary borrowers (for example, small businesses or corporations) may be required by the Federal agency to obtain a UEI or register in

      § 25.110   Exceptions to this part.

#### § § 25.110

      (a)  (1) Under a condition identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a Federal agency may exempt an applicant or recipient of Federal financial assistance from the requirement to obtain a UEI, register in , or both.

      (i) If a Federal agency grants an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Federal agency must use a generic entity identifier in the data it reports to  if reporting for a prime award of Federal financial assistance to the recipient is required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended, hereafter cited as “Transparency Act”). Granting an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not impact a Federal agency's responsibility for reporting under the Transparency Act, except that it may use a generic entity identifier in the circumstances described.

      (ii) Federal agencies should use generic entity identifiers rarely as it prevents recipients from fulfilling reporting requirements such as subaward or executive compensation reporting required by the Transparency Act.

      (2) A Federal agency may exempt an applicant, recipient, or subrecipient when:

      (i) The Federal agency determines that it must protect information about the entity from disclosure in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States or to avoid jeopardizing the personal safety of the entity's staff, partners, beneficiaries, and participants;

      (ii)(A) All of the following conditions are met:

      () The entity is a foreign organization or foreign public entity;

      () The Federal award or subaward will be performed outside the United States;

      () The Federal award or subaward will be less than $25,000; and

      () The Federal agency deems it to be impractical for the entity to comply with the requirements of this part.

      (B) The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach;

      (iii) For applicants or recipients, the Federal agency may exempt foreign organizations or foreign public entities from completing full registration in  for a Federal award less than $500,000 that will be performed outside the United States. Foreign organizations or foreign public entities exempted from registering in  under this provision must still obtain a UEI. The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach; or

      (iv) For applicants, the Federal agency determines that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a UEI and registering in  before receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal agencies must require the recipient to obtain a UEI and complete registration in  within 30 days of the Federal award date.

      (b)  OMB may approve additional exceptions for classes of Federal awards, applicants, or recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute.

    Subpart B—Policy

      § 25.200   Requirements for notice of funding opportunities, regulations, and application instructions.

#### § § 25.200

      (a) A Federal agency that issues Federal financial assistance (see § 25.400) must include the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section in each notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance containing instructions for applicants that is issued on or after the effective date of this guidance. A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that a Federal agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or any other term.

      (b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that does not have an exemption under § 25.110 to:

      (1) Be registered in  before submitting an application;

      (2) Maintain a current and active registration in  at all times during which it has an active Federal award as a recipient or an application under consideration by a Federal agency. The applicant or recipient must review and update its information in  annually from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates to ensure it is current, accurate, and complete. If applicable, this includes identifying the applicant's or recipient's immediate and highest-level owner and subsidiaries, as well as providing information on all predecessors that have received a Federal award or contract within the last three years; and

      (3) Include its UEI in each application it submits to the Federal agency.

      (c) For the purposes of this policy, the applicant must meet the Federal agency's eligibility criteria and have the legal authority to apply for and receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a UEI. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal agency program, but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the UEI of the lead applicant must be used.

      § 25.205   Effect of noncompliance with a requirement to obtain a UEI or register in .

#### § § 25.205

      (a) Unless an entity is exempt under § 25.110, a Federal agency may not issue a Federal award or amend an existing Federal award to provide additional Federal funds if the entity is not in compliance with the requirements of this part. This does not apply to amendments to terminate or close out a Federal award.

      (b) At the time a Federal agency is ready to make a Federal award, if the intended recipient has not complied with the requirements to obtain a UEI and maintain an active registration in  with current information, the Federal agency may make a Federal award to another applicant.

      § 25.210   Authority to modify agency application forms or formats.

#### § § 25.210

      To implement the policies in §§ 25.200 and 25.205, a Federal agency may add a UEI field to information collections previously approved by OMB, with no further approval required.

      § 25.215   Requirements for agency information systems.

#### § § 25.215

      Each Federal agency that awards Federal financial assistance (see § 25.400) must ensure that its information systems are able to both accept and transmit the UEI as the universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants and recipients.

      § 25.220   Use of award term.

#### § § 25.220

      (a) A Federal agency must include the award term in Appendix A in all Federal financial assistance agreements (see § 25.400) to accomplish the purpose of § 25.100.

      (b) A Federal agency may use different letters and numbers than those in Appendix A to designate the paragraphs of the award term.

    Subpart C—Recipient Requirements of Subrecipients

      § 25.300   Requirement for recipients to ensure subrecipients have a unique entity identifier.

#### § § 25.300

      (a) A recipient may not make a subaward to a subrecipient that has not obtained a UEI and provided it to the recipient. Subrecipients are not required to complete full registration in  to obtain a UEI.

      (b) A recipient must notify any potential subrecipients that the recipient cannot make a subaward unless the subrecipient obtains and provides a UEI to the recipient.

      § 176.60   Statutory requirement.

#### § § 176.60

      Section 1605 of the Recovery Act prohibits use of recovery funds for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States. The law requires that this prohibition be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements, and it provides for waiver under three circumstances:

      (a) Iron, steel, or relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality;

      (b) Inclusion of iron, steel, or manufactured goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent; or

      (c) Applying the domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.

      § 176.70   Policy.

#### § § 176.70

      Except as provided in § 176.80 or § 176.90—

      (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Recovery Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work (see definitions at §§ 176.140 and 176.160) unless—

      (1) The public building or public work is located in the United States; and

      (2) All of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced or manufactured in the United States.

      (i) Production in the United States of the iron or steel used in the project requires that all manufacturing processes must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. These requirements do not apply to iron or steel used as components or subcomponents of manufactured goods used in the project.

      (ii) There is no requirement with regard to the origin of components or subcomponents in manufactured goods used in the project, as long as the manufacturing occurs in the United States.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply where the Recovery Act requires the application of alternative Buy American requirements for iron, steel, and manufactured goods.

      § 176.80   Exceptions.

#### § § 176.80

      (a) When one of the following exceptions applies in a case or category of cases, the award official may allow the recipient to use foreign iron, steel and/or manufactured goods in the project without regard to the restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act:

      (1)  The head of the Federal department or agency may determine that the iron, steel or relevant manufactured good is not produced or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. The determinations of nonavailability of the articles listed at 48 CFR 25.104(a) and the procedures at 48 CFR 25.103(b)(1) also apply if any of those articles are manufactured goods needed in the project.

      (2)  The head of the Federal department or agency may determine that the cost of domestic iron, steel, or relevant manufactured goods will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent in accordance with § 176.110.

      (3)  The head of the Federal department or agency may determine that application of the restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act would be inconsistent with the public interest.

      (b) When a determination is made for any of the reasons stated in this section that certain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods may be used—

      (1) The award official shall list the excepted materials in the award; and

      (2) The head of the Federal department or agency shall publish a notice in the  within two weeks after the determination is made, unless the item has already been determined to be domestically nonavailable. A list of items that are not domestically available is at 48 CFR 25.104(a). The  notice or information from the notice may be posted by OMB to Recovery.gov. The notice shall include—

      (i) The title “Buy American Exception under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009”;

      (ii) The dollar value and brief description of the project; and

As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more and projects that are not specifically excluded from the application of those agreements.

      (b) The international agreements that obligate recipients that are covered under an international agreement to treat the goods and services of a Party the same as domestic goods and services and the respective Parties to the agreements are:

> [74 FR 18450, Apr. 23, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 14323, Mar. 25, 2010]

      § 176.100   Timely determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act.

#### § § 176.100

      (a) The head of the Federal department or agency involved may make a determination regarding inapplicability of section 1605 to a particular case or to a category of cases.

      (b) Before Recovery Act funds are awarded by the Federal agency or obligated by the recipient for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work, an applicant or recipient may request from the award official a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act for specifically identified items.

      (c) The time for submitting the request and the information and supporting data that must be included in the request are to be specified in the agency's and recipient's request for applications and/or proposals, and as appropriate, in other written communications. The content of those communications should be consistent with the notice in § 176.150 or § 176.170, whichever applies.

      (d) The award official must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.

      (e) In making a determination based on the increased cost to the project of using domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, the award official must compare the total estimated cost of the project using foreign iron, steel and/or relevant manufactured goods to the estimated cost if all domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods were used. If use of domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods would increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent, then the award official shall determine that the cost of the domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods is unreasonable.

      § 176.110   Evaluating proposals of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

#### § § 176.110

      (a) If the award official receives a request for an exception based on the cost of certain domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods being unreasonable, in accordance with § 176.80, then the award official shall apply evaluation factors to the proposal to use such foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods as follows:

      (1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total estimated cost of the project, if the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods are to be used in the project based on an exception for unreasonable cost requested by the applicant.

      (2) Total evaluated cost = project cost estimate + (.25 × project cost estimate, if paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies).

      (b) Applicants or recipients also may submit alternate proposals based on use of equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods to avoid possible denial of Recovery Act funding for the proposal if the Federal Government determines that an exception permitting use of the foreign item(s) does not apply.

      (c) If the award official makes an award to an applicant that proposed foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods not listed in the applicable notice in the request for applications or proposals, then the award official must add the excepted materials to the list in the award term.

      § 176.120   Determinations on late requests.

#### § § 176.120

      (a) If a recipient requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act after obligating Recovery Act funds for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair (late request), the recipient must explain why it could not request the determination before making the obligation or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the award official concludes that the recipient should have made the request before making the obligation, the award official may deny the request.

      (b) The award official must base evaluation of any late request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act on information required by § 176.150(c) and (d) or § 176.170(c) and (d) and/or other readily available information.

      (c) If a determination, under § 176.80 is made after Recovery Act funds were obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official must amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis of the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods the award official shall adjust the award amount or the budget, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in § 176.110(a).

      § 176.130   Noncompliance.

#### § § 176.130

      The award official must—

      (a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act;

      (b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the recipient of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and

      (c) If the review reveals that a recipient or subrecipient has used foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:

      (1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act in accordance with § 176.120.

      (2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

      (3) If removal and replacement of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in a public building or a public work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Federal Government, the award official may determine in writing that the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not affect the Federal Government's right to reduce the amount of the award by the cost of the steel, iron, or manufactured goods that are used in the project or to take enforcement or termination action in accordance with the agency's grants management regulations.

      (4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate remedies, such as withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency, suspending or terminating the award, and withholding further awards for the project. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with the agency's debarment rule implementing 2 CFR part 180. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.

      § 176.140   Award term—Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods—Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

#### § § 176.140

      When awarding Recovery Act funds for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work that does not involve iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods covered under international agreements, the agency shall use the award term described in the following paragraphs:

      (a)  As used in this award term and condition—

      (1)  means a good brought to the construction site for incorporation into the building or work that has been—

      (i) Processed into a specific form and shape; or

      (ii) Combined with other raw material to create a material that has different properties than the properties of the individual raw materials.

      (2)  means a public building of, and a public work of, a governmental entity (the United States; the District of Columbia; commonwealths, territories, and minor outlying islands of the United States; State and local governments; and multi-State, regional, or interstate entities which have governmental functions). These buildings and works may include, without limitation, bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways, airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, and canals, and the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of such buildings and works.

      (3)  means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between .02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.

      (b)  (1) This award term and condition implements Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5), by requiring that all iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section and condition.

      (2) This requirement does not apply to the material listed by the Federal Government as follows:

      (3) The award official may add other iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and condition if the Federal Government determines that—

      (i) The cost of the domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods would be unreasonable. The cost of domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods used in the project is unreasonable when the cumulative cost of such material will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent;

      (ii) The iron, steel, and/or manufactured good is not produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or

      (iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery Act would be inconsistent with the public interest.

      (c)  (1)(i) Any recipient request to use foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall include adequate information for Federal Government evaluation of the request, including—

      (A) A description of the foreign and domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods;

      (B) Unit of measure;

      (C) Quantity;

      (D) Cost;

      (E) Time of delivery or availability;

      (F) Location of the project;

      (G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and

      (H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed cost comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (iii) The cost of iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty.

      (iv) Any recipient request for a determination submitted after Recovery Act funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair shall explain why the recipient could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before the funds were obligated. If the recipient does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the award official need not make a determination.

      (2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award amount or redistribute budgeted funds by at least the differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).

      (3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods is noncompliant with section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

      (d)  To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (b) of this section based on unreasonable cost, the Recipient shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:

      § 176.150   Notice of Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods—Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

      When requesting applications or proposals for Recovery Act programs or activities that may involve construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work, and do not involve iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods covered under international agreements, the agency shall use the notice described in the following paragraphs in their solicitations:

      (a)  Manufactured good, public building and public work, and steel, as used in this notice, are defined in the 2 CFR 176.140.

      (b)  A prospective applicant requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) should submit the request to the award official in time to allow a determination before submission of applications or proposals. The prospective applicant shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs at 2 CFR 176.140(c) and (d) in the request. If an applicant has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of 1605 of the Recovery Act before submitting its application or proposal, or has not received a response to a previous request, the applicant shall include the information and supporting data in the application or proposal.

      (c)  If the Federal Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods applies, the Federal Government will evaluate a project requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act by adding to the estimated total cost of the project 25 percent of the project cost, if foreign iron, steel, or manufactured goods are used in the project based on unreasonable cost of comparable manufactured domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

      (d)  (1) When a project proposal includes foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods not listed by the Federal Government at 2 CFR 176.140(b)(2), the applicant also may submit an alternate proposal based on use of equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

      (2) If an alternate proposal is submitted, the applicant shall submit a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with 2 CFR 176.140(c) and (d) for the proposal that is based on the use of any foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods for which the Federal Government has not yet determined an exception applies.

      (3) If the Federal Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with 2 CFR 176.140(b) does not apply, the Federal Government will evaluate only those proposals based on use of the equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, and the applicant shall be required to furnish such domestic items.

      and  means a public building of, and a _public work_ of, a governmental entity (the United States; the District of Columbia; commonwealths, territories, and minor outlying islands of the United States; State and local governments; and multi-State, regional, or interstate entities which have governmental functions). These buildings and works may include, without limitation, bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways, airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, and canals, and the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of such buildings and works.

      means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between .02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.

      (b)  (1) The award term and condition described in this section implements—

      (i) Section 1605(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act), by requiring that all iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States; and

      (ii) Section 1605(d), which requires application of the Buy American requirement in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. The restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act do not apply to designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. The Buy American requirement in section 1605 shall not be applied where the iron, steel or manufactured goods used in the project are from a Party to an international agreement that obligates the recipient to treat the goods and services of that Party the same as domestic goods and services. As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more.

      (2) The recipient shall use only domestic or designated country iron, steel, and manufactured goods in performing the work funded in whole or part with this award, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.

      (3) The requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to the iron, steel, and manufactured goods listed by the Federal Government as follows:

      (4) The award official may add other iron, steel, and manufactured goods to the list in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the Federal Government determines that—

      (i) The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods would be unreasonable. The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in the project is unreasonable when the cumulative cost of such material will increase the overall cost of the project by more than 25 percent;

      (ii) The iron, steel, and/or manufactured good is not produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality; or

      (iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery Act would be inconsistent with the public interest.

      (c)  (1)(i) Any recipient request to use foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall include adequate information for Federal Government evaluation of the request, including—

      (A) A description of the foreign and domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods;

      (B) Unit of measure;

      (C) Quantity;

      (D) Cost;

      (E) Time of delivery or availability;

      (F) Location of the project;

      (G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and

      (H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed cost comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (iii) The cost of iron, steel, or manufactured goods shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty.

      (iv) Any recipient request for a determination submitted after Recovery Act funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair shall explain why the recipient could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before the funds were obligated. If the recipient does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the award official need not make a determination.

      (2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods.. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award amount or redistribute budgeted funds, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).

      (3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods other than designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods is noncompliant with the applicable Act.

      (d)  To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (b) of this section based on unreasonable cost, the applicant shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:

> [74 FR 18450, Apr. 23, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 14323, Mar. 25, 2010]

      § 176.170   Notice of Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods (covered under International Agreements)—Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

#### § § 176.170

      When requesting applications or proposals for Recovery Act programs or activities that may involve construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work, and involve iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods covered under international agreements, the agency shall use the notice described in the following paragraphs in the solicitation:

      (a)  and , and , as used in this provision, are defined in 2 CFR 176.160(a).

      (b)  A prospective applicant requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) should submit the request to the award official in time to allow a determination before submission of applications or proposals. The prospective applicant shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by 2 CFR 176.160 (c) and (d) in the request. If an applicant has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act before submitting its application or proposal, or has not received a response to a previous request, the applicant shall include the information and supporting data in the application or proposal.

      (c)  If the Federal Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods applies, the Federal Government will evaluate a project requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act by adding to the estimated total cost of the project 25 percent of the project cost if foreign iron, steel, or manufactured goods are used based on unreasonable cost of comparable domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods.

      (d)  (1) When a project proposal includes foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, other than designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, that are not listed by the Federal Government in this Buy American notice in the request for applications or proposals, the applicant may submit an alternate proposal based on use of equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

      (2) If an alternate proposal is submitted, the applicant shall submit a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs 2 CFR 176.160(c) and (d) for the proposal that is based on the use of any foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods for which the Federal Government has not yet determined an exception applies.

      (3) If the Federal Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with 2 CFR 176.160(b) does not apply, the Federal Government will evaluate only those proposals based on use of the equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, and the applicant shall be required to furnish such domestic or designated country items.

    Subpart C—Wage Rate Requirements Under Section 1606 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

      § 176.180   Procedure.

#### § § 176.180

      The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.

      § 176.190   Award term—Wage rate requirements under Section 1606 of the Recovery Act.

#### § § 176.190

      When issuing announcements or requesting applications for Recovery Act programs or activities that may involve construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair the agency shall use the award term described in the following paragraphs:

      (a) Section 1606 of the Recovery Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal Government pursuant to the Recovery Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.

      Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14 and the Copeland Act, 40 U.S.C. 3145, the Department of Labor has issued regulations at 29 CFR parts 1, 3, and 5 to implement the Davis-Bacon and related Acts. Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).

      (b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.

    Subpart D—Single Audit Information for Recipients of Recovery Act Funds

      § 176.200   Procedure.

#### § § 176.200

      The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.

      § 176.210   Award term—Recovery Act transactions listed in Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and Recipient Responsibilities for Informing Subrecipients.

#### § § 176.210

      The award term described in this section shall be used by agencies to clarify recipient responsibilities regarding tracking and documenting Recovery Act expenditures:

      (a) To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements” and OMB Circular A-102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A-102 is available at

      (b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations,” recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) required by OMB Circular A-133. OMB Circular A-133 is available at  This shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF-SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix “ARRA-” in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF-SAC.

      (c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing program.

      (d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

    § 176.10   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 176.10

    This part establishes Federal Governmentwide award terms for financial assistance awards, namely, grants, cooperative agreements, and loans, to implement the cross-cutting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5 (Recovery Act). These requirements are cross-cutting in that they apply to more than one agency's awards.

    § 176.20   Agency responsibilities (general).

#### § § 176.20

    (a) In any assistance award funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, the award official shall indicate that the award is being made under the Recovery Act, and indicate what projects and/or activities are being funded under the Recovery Act. This requirement applies whenever Recovery Act funds are used, regardless of the assistance type.

    (b) To maximize transparency of Recovery Act funds required for reporting by the assistance recipient, the award official shall consider structuring assistance awards to allow for separately tracking Recovery Act funds.

    (c) Award officials shall ensure that recipients comply with the Recovery Act requirements of Subpart A. If the recipient fails to comply with the reporting requirements or other award terms, the award official or other authorized agency action official shall take the appropriate enforcement or termination action in accordance with 2 CFR 215.62 or the agency's implementation of the OMB Circular A-102 grants management common rule. OMB Circular A-102 is available at

    (d) The award official shall make the recipient's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the recipient's performance record.

    § 176.30   Definitions.

#### § § 176.30

    As used in this part—

    means any grant, cooperative agreement or loan made with Recovery Act funds. _Award_ official means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate financial assistance awards and make related determinations and findings.

    or  means any knowledge that can be communicated or any documentary material, regardless of its physical form or characteristics, that—

    (1)(i) Is owned by, is produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government; or

    (ii) Has been classified by the Department of Energy as privately generated restricted data following the procedures in 10 CFR 1045.21; and

    (2) Must be protected against unauthorized disclosure according to Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, April 17, 1995, or classified in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.

    means any entity other than an individual that receives Recovery Act funds in the form of a grant, cooperative agreement or loan directly from the Federal Government.

    or  are funds made available through the appropriations of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5.

    means—

    (1) A legal instrument to provide support for the performance of any portion of the substantive project or program for which the recipient received this award and that the recipient awards to an eligible subrecipient;

    (2) The term does not include the recipient's procurement of property and services needed to carry out the project or program (for further explanation, see §____.210 of the attachment to OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations”). OMB Circular A-133 is available at

    (3) A subaward may be provided through any legal agreement, including an agreement that the recipient or a subrecipient considers a contract.

    means a legal instrument used by a recipient for procurement of property and services needed to carry out the project or program.

    or  means a non-Federal entity that expends Federal awards received from a pass-through entity to carry out a Federal program, but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such a program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. Guidance on distinguishing between a subrecipient and a vendor is provided in §____.210 of OMB Circular A-133.

    Subpart A—General

      § 180.100   How are subparts A through I organized?

#### § § 180.100

      (a) Each subpart contains information related to a broad topic or specific audience with special responsibilities, as shown in table 1:

      (b) Table 2 shows which subparts may be of special interest to you, depending on who you are:

      § 180.105   How is this part written?

#### § § 180.105

      (a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community. The section headings and text must be read together, as they are often in the form of questions and answers.

      (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

      (c) The “Covered Transactions” diagram in the appendix to this part shows the levels or “tiers” at which a Federal agency may enforce an exclusion.

      § 180.110   Do terms in this part have special meanings?

#### § § 180.110

      This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart I. For example, three important terms are:

      (a)  which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);

      (b)  which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of a Federal agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and

      (c)  which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.

      § 180.115   What do subparts A through I of this part do?

#### § § 180.115

      Subparts A through I provide for the reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulations and provide for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order or other legal authority.

      § 180.120   Do subparts A through I of this part apply to me?

#### § § 180.120

      Portions of subparts A through I (see table at § 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a:

      (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;

      (b) Respondent (a person against whom a Federal agency has initiated a debarment for suspension action);

      (c) Federal agency debarring or suspending official; or

      (d) Federal agency official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

      § 180.125   What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

#### § § 180.125

      (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.

      (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude persons who are not presently responsible from Federal programs.

      (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

      § 180.130   How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

#### § § 180.130

      With the exceptions stated in §§ 180.135, 315, and 420, a person who is excluded by any Federal agency may not:

      (a) Be a participant in a Federal agency transaction that is a covered transaction; or

      (b) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.

      § 180.135   May a Federal agency grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 180.135

      (a) A Federal agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Federal agency head or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the government-wide policy in Executive Order 12549.

      (b) An exception granted by one Federal agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another Federal agency.

      § 180.140   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

#### § § 180.140

      When a Federal agency excludes a person under Executive Order 12549 or Executive Order 12689 on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible for Federal procurement transactions under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has a reciprocal effect on Federal procurement transactions.

      § 180.145   Does an exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 180.145

      When a Federal agency excludes a person under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal agencies' nonprocurement covered transactions. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has a reciprocal effect on Federal nonprocurement transactions.

      § 180.150   Against whom may a Federal agency take an exclusion action?

#### § § 180.150

      Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, a Federal agency may exclude any person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be a participant or principal in a covered transaction.

      § 180.155   How do I know if a person is excluded?

#### § § 180.155

      Check the System for Award Management () Exclusions to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains  Exclusions and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E. When a Federal agency takes action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into __SAM.gov__ Exclusions.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 180.200   What is a covered transaction?

#### § § 180.200

      A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction subject to this part's prohibitions. It may be a transaction at:

      (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see Appendix to this part); or

      (b) A lower tier between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

      § 180.205   Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

#### § § 180.205

      The importance of whether a transaction is a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

      (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

      (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

      (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless:

      (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 180.310 or § 180.415; or

      (2) A Federal agency official obtains an exception from the agency head or designee to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 180.135.

      § 180.210   Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

#### § § 180.210

      All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 180.970, are covered transactions unless listed in the exemptions under § 180.215.

      § 180.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

#### § § 180.215

      The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

      (a) A direct award to:

      (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

      (2) A public international organization;

      (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

      (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

      (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, when a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301  those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

      (c) Federal employment.

      (d) A transaction that a Federal agency needs to respond to a national or agency recognized emergency or disaster.

      (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless a Federal agency specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

      (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

      (g) Any other transaction if:

      (1) The application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law; or

      (2) A Federal agency's regulation exempts it from coverage under this part.

      (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, covered transactions must include non-procurement and procurement transactions involving entities engaged in activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in a country's non-compliance with its obligations under arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States. Federal agencies and primary tier non-procurement recipients must not award, renew, or extend a non-procurement transaction or procurement transaction, regardless of amount or tier, with any entity listed in SAM.gov Exclusions on the basis of involvement in activities that violate arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States (see section 1290 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017). The head of a Federal agency may grant an exception to this requirement under 2 CFR 180.135 and with the concurrence of the OMB Director.

      § 180.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

#### § § 180.220

      (a) Covered transactions under this part:

      (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

      (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded under nonprocurement covered transactions.

      (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

      (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction covered under § 180.210, and the contract amount is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      (2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract is always a covered transaction regardless of the amount or who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to this part.

      (3) The contract is for Federally required audit services.

      (c) A subcontract also is a covered transaction if:

      (1) It is awarded by a participant in a procurement transaction under a nonprocurement transaction of a Federal agency that extends the coverage of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to additional tiers of contracts (see the diagram in the Appendix to this part showing that optional lower tier coverage); and

      (2) The value of the subcontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      § 180.225   How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

#### § § 180.225

Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.

      § 180.625   What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

#### § § 180.625

      If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

      (b)  A Federal agency may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.

      (c)  A Federal agency may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, corporation, company, or similar arrangement or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 180.700   When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

#### § § 180.700

      Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that:

      (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 180.800(a), or

      (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 180.800(b) through (d); and

      (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

      § 180.705   What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

#### § § 180.705

      (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.

      (b) In making this determination, the suspending official may examine:

      (1) The basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents;

      (2) An indictment, criminal information, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual or legal matters constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions; and

      (3) Other indicators of adequate evidence that may include, but are not limited to, warrants and their accompanying affidavits.

      (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

      § 180.710   When does a suspension take effect?

#### § § 180.710

      (6) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;

      (c) Of any other irregularities supporting your suspension in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing certain evidence in the Federal Government's pending or contemplated legal proceedings;

      (d) Of the cause(s) upon which the suspending official relied under § 180.700 for imposing suspension;

      (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;

      (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to the information contained in the Notice of Suspension;

      (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or

      (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.

      § 180.750   What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

#### § § 180.750

      (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes:

      (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial decision to suspend you;

#### § § 180.755

      The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record.

#### § § 180.760

In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

      § 180.810   When does a debarment take effect?

#### § § 180.810

      § 180.815   How may I contest a proposed debarment?

#### § § 180.815

      As a respondent, if you wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or your representative must provide the debarring official with information in opposition to the proposed debarment.

      (b) You will have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that:

      (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

#### § § 180.845

      (a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in § 180.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at § 180.860.

      (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes:

      (1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed debarment;

      § 180.860   What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

#### § § 180.860

      This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

      (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

      (b) The frequency of incidents or duration of the wrongdoing.

      (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

      (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

      (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not government-wide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

      (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.

      (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

      (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.

      (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

      (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

      (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

      (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or implemented remedial or protective measures in the form of procedures, policies, and programs to effectively address the activity cited as a basis for the debarment.

      (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.

      (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.

      (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.

      (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.

      (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.

      (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.

      (s) Whether your business, technical, or professional license(s) has been suspended, terminated, or revoked.

      (t) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.

      § 180.865   How long may my debarment last?

#### § § 180.865

      (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.

      (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 180.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.

      (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.

      § 180.870   When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

#### § § 180.870

      (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information, and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.

#### § § 180.875

      Yes. As a debarred person, you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must submit your request in writing and support it with documentation.

      § 180.880   What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

#### § § 180.880

      The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on:

      (a) Newly discovered material evidence;

      (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;

      (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

      (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

      (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.

      § 180.885   May the debarring official extend a debarment?

#### § § 180.885

      (a) Yes. The debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.

      (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.

      (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F, to extend the debarment.

    § 180.10   How is this part organized?

#### § § 180.10

    This part is organized into two segments.

    (a) Sections 180.5 through 180.45 contain general policy direction for Federal agencies' use of the standards in subparts A through I.

    (b) Subparts A through I contain uniform government-wide standards that Federal agencies are to use to specify:

    (1) The types of transactions that are covered by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system;

    (2) The effects of an exclusion under that nonprocurement system, including reciprocal effects with the government-wide debarment and suspension system for procurement;

    (3) The criteria and minimum due process to be used in nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions; and

    (4) Related policies and procedures to ensure the effectiveness of those actions.

    § 180.15   To whom does the guidance apply?

#### § § 180.15

    This part provides guidance to Federal agencies. Publication of this guidance in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) does not change its nature—it is guidance and not regulation. Federal agencies' implementation of this guidance governs the rights and responsibilities of other persons affected by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system.

    § 180.20   What must a Federal agency do to implement these guidelines?

#### § § 180.20

    As Section 3 of Executive Order 12549 requires, each Federal agency with nonprocurement programs and activities covered by subparts A through I of the guidance must issue regulations consistent with those subparts.

    § 180.25   What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?

#### § § 180.25

    Each Federal agency's implementing regulation:

    (a) Must establish policies and procedures for that Federal agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension programs and activities consistent with this guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have a regulatory effect on that Federal agency's programs and activities.

    (b) Must address some matters for which these guidelines give each Federal agency some discretion. Specifically, the regulation must:

    (1) Identify either the Federal agency head or the title of the designated official who is authorized to grant exceptions under § 180.135 to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction.

    (2) State whether the Federal agency includes as covered transactions an additional tier of contracts awarded under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under § 180.220(c).

    (3) Identify the method(s) a Federal agency official may use when entering into a covered transaction with a primary tier participant to communicate to the participant the requirements described in § 180.435. Examples of methods are an award term that requires compliance as a condition of the award, an assurance of compliance obtained at the time of application, or a certification.

    (4) State whether the Federal agency specifies a particular method that participants must use to communicate compliance requirements to lower tier participants, as described in § 180.330(a). If there is a specified method, the regulation must require Federal agency officials to communicate that requirement when entering into covered transactions with primary tier participants.

    (c) May also, at the Federal agency's option:

    (1) Identify any specific types of transactions the Federal agency includes as “nonprocurement transactions” in addition to the examples provided in § 180.970.

    (2) Identify any types of nonprocurement transactions that the Federal agency exempts from coverage under these guidelines, as authorized under § 180.215(g)(2).

    (3) Identify specific examples of types of individuals who would be “principals” under the Federal agency's nonprocurement programs and transactions, in addition to the types of individuals described in § 180.995.

    (4) Specify the Federal agency's procedures, if any, by which a respondent may appeal a suspension or debarment decision.

    (5) Identify by title the officials designated by the Federal agency head as debarring officials under § 180.930 or suspending officials under § 180.1010.

    (6) Include a subpart covering disqualifications, as authorized in § 180.45.

    (7) Include any provisions authorized by OMB.

    § 180.30   Where does a Federal agency implement these guidelines?

#### § § 180.30

    Each Federal agency that participates in the government-wide nonprocurement debarment and suspension system must issue a regulation implementing these guidelines within its chapter in subtitle B of this title.

    § 180.40   How are these guidelines maintained?

#### § § 180.40

    The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, established by section 4 of Executive Order 12549, recommends to the OMB any needed revisions to the guidelines in this part. The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidelines in the  for public comment, considers comments with the help of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, and issues the final guidelines.

    § 180.45   Do these guidelines cover persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 180.45

    A Federal agency may add a subpart covering disqualifications to its regulation implementing these guidelines, but the guidelines in subparts A through I:

    (a) Address disqualified persons only to:

    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) Exclusions; and

    (2) State the responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

    (b) Do not specify the:

    (1) Transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;

    (2) Entities to which a disqualification applies; or

    (3) Process that a Federal agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion under subparts A through I of this part, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes and may include special procedures.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 182.100   How is this part written?

#### § § 182.100

      (a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use and understand. The section headings and text must be read together, as they are often in the form of questions and answers.

      (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

      § 182.105   Do terms in this part have special meanings?

#### § § 182.105

      This part uses terms that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart F.

      § 182.110   What do subparts A through F of this part do?

#### § § 182.110

      Subparts A through F specify standard policies and procedures to carry out the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for financial assistance awards.

      § 182.115   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 182.115

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either:

      (1) A recipient of a Federal assistance award (see definitions of award and recipient in §§ 182.605 and 182.660, respectively); or

      (2) A Federal agency awarding official.

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 182.120   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 182.120

      This part does not apply to any award to which the Federal agency head, or their designee, determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

      § 182.125   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 182.125

      This part will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 182.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 182.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 182.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to:

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 182.205 through 182.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 182.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 182.230).

      § 182.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 182.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, the employee:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if the employee is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 182.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 182.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 182.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      § 182.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 182.215

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about:

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 182.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 182.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 182.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 182.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 182.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 182.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 182.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must:

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

      (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every Federal agency awarding official or their designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

      (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either:

      (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

      (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or another appropriate agency.

      § 182.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 182.230

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Federal agency award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces:

      (1) To the Federal agency awarding official that is making the Federal award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the Federal award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by agency officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for a Federal award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (for example, all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the Federal agency awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the Federal award, you must inform the Federal agency awarding official.

    Subpart C—Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

      § 182.300   What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

      As a condition of receiving a Federal award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that:

      (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the Federal award; and

      (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any Federal award activity, you will report the conviction:

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the Federal agency awarding official or their designee for each Federal award that you currently have, unless the agency designates a central point for the receipt of the notices, either in the award document or its regulation implementing the guidance in this part. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected Federal award.

    Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Awarding Officials

      § 182.400   What are my responsibilities as a Federal agency awarding official?

#### § § 182.400

      As a Federal agency awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in:

      (a) Subpart B of this part, if the recipient is not an individual; or

      (b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

    Subpart E—Violations of This Part and Consequences

      § 182.500   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 182.500

      A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Federal agency head or their designee determines, in writing, that:

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good-faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

      § 182.505   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 182.505

      A recipient who is an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Federal agency head or their designee determines, in writing, that:

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart C of this part; or

      (b) The recipient is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity.

      § 182.510   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 182.510

      If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 182.500 or § 182.505, the Federal agency may take one or more of the following actions:

      (a) Suspension of payments under the award;

      (b) Suspension or termination of the award; and

      (c) Suspension or debarment of the recipient under the Federal agency's regulation implementing the OMB guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) for a period not to exceed five years.

      § 182.515   Are there any exceptions to those actions?

#### § § 182.515

      For a particular award, the Federal agency head may waive, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the agency head determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.

      means an action taken by a Federal agency that immediately prohibits a recipient from participating in Federal Government procurement contracts and covered nonprocurement transactions for a temporary period, pending completion of an investigation and any judicial or administrative proceedings that may ensue. A recipient so prohibited is suspended in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation for procurement contracts (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4) and Federal agency regulations implementing the OMB guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180, which implements Executive Orders 12549 and 12689). _Suspension_ of a recipient is a distinct and separate action from suspension of an award or suspension of payments under an award.

    § 182.5   What does this part do?

#### § § 182.5

    This part provides guidance for Federal agencies on the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 8101-8106, as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

    § 182.10   How is this part organized?

#### § § 182.10

    This part is organized into two segments.

    (a) Sections 182.5 through 182.40 contain general policy direction for Federal agencies' use of the uniform policies and procedures in subparts A through F.

    (b) Subparts A through F contain uniform government-wide policies and procedures for Federal agency use to specify the:

    (1) Types of awards that are covered by drug-free workplace requirements;

    (2) Drug-free workplace requirements with which a recipient must comply;

    (3) Actions required of a Federal agency awarding official; and

    (4) Consequences of a violation of drug-free workplace requirements.

    § 182.15   To whom does the guidance apply?

#### § § 182.15

    This part provides guidance to Federal agencies. Publication of this guidance in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) does not change its nature—it is guidance and not regulation. Federal agencies' implementation of this guidance governs the rights and responsibilities of other persons affected by the drug-free workplace requirements.

    § 182.20   What must a Federal agency do to implement the guidance?

#### § § 182.20

    To comply with the requirement in 41 U.S.C. 8106 for government-wide regulations, each Federal agency that awards grants or cooperative agreements or makes other financial assistance awards that are subject to the drug-free workplace requirements in subparts A through F of the guidance must issue a regulation consistent with those subparts.

    § 182.25   What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?

#### § § 182.25

    Each Federal agency's implementing regulation:

    (a) Must establish drug-free workplace policies and procedures for that Federal agency's Federal awards consistent with this guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have a regulatory effect on that Federal agency's awards.

    (b) Must address some matters for which the guidance in this part gives the Federal agency discretion. Specifically, the regulation must:

    (1) State whether the Federal agency:

    (i) Has a central point to which a recipient may send the notification of a conviction that is required under § 182.225(a) or § 182.300(b); or

    (ii) Requires the recipient to send the notification to the Federal agency awarding official or their designee for each Federal award.

    (2) Either:

    (i) State that the Federal agency head is the official authorized to determine under § 182.500 or § 182.505 that a recipient has violated the drug-free workplace requirements; or

    (ii) Provide the title of the official designated to make that determination.

    (c) May also, at the Federal agency's option, identify any specific types of financial assistance awards, in addition to grants and cooperative agreements, to which the Federal agency makes this guidance applicable.

    § 182.30   Where does a Federal agency implement the guidance?

#### § § 182.30

    Each Federal agency that awards grants or cooperative agreements or makes other financial assistance awards that are subject to the drug-free workplace guidance in this part must issue a regulation implementing the guidance within its chapter in subtitle B of this title of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    § 182.40   How is the guidance maintained?

#### § § 182.40

    The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidance in the  for public comment, considers comments with the help of appropriate interagency working groups, and then issues any changes to the guidance in final form.

### Part 184

**Authority:** Authority: Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429.

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 57787, Aug. 23, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

    § 184.1   Purpose and policy.

#### § § 184.1

    (a)  This part provides guidance to Federal agencies on the implementation of the Buy America Preference applicable to Federal financial assistance set forth in part I of subtitle A, Buy America Sourcing Preferences, of the Build America, Buy America Act included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58) at division G, title IX, subtitle A, part I, sections 70911 through 70917.

    (b)  The head of each Federal agency must ensure that none of the funds made available for a Federal award for an infrastructure project may be obligated unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials incorporated into the project are produced in the United States.  section 70914(a) of the Build America Buy America Act.

    § 184.2   Applicability, effective date, and severability.

#### § § 184.2

    (a)  This part does not apply to a Buy America Preference meeting or exceeding the requirements of section 70914 of the Build America, Buy America Act applied by a Federal agency to Federal awards for infrastructure projects before November 15, 2021.

    (b)  The effective date of this part is October 23, 2023. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this part applies to Federal awards obligated on or after its effective date. Awards obligated on or after May 14, 2022, the effective date of the Build America, Buy America Act, and before the effective date of this part, are instead subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11.

    (c)  If an infrastructure project that has previously received a Federal award obligated on or after May 14, 2022, but before the effective date of this part receives an additional Federal award obligated within one year of the effective date of this part, the additional Federal award is subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11. However, if significant design or planning changes are made to the infrastructure project, the Federal agency may apply this part to the additional Federal award. Federal awards for an infrastructure project obligated after one year from the effective date of this part are subject to this part, regardless of whether this part applied to previous awards for the project.

    (d)  The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. OMB intends that if a provision of this part is held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to a particular person or circumstance, the provision should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect permitted by law as applied to other persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. If any provision is determined to be wholly invalid and unenforceable, it should be severed from the remaining provisions of this part, which should remain in effect.

    § 184.3   Definitions.

#### § § 184.3

    Acronyms used in this part have the same meaning as provided in 2 CFR 200.0. Terms not defined in this part have the same meaning as provided in 2 CFR 200.1, except for the terms “equipment,” “expenditures,” and “supplies,” which are not specifically defined for this part.

    § 184.4   Applying the Buy America Preference to a Federal award.

#### § § 184.4

    (a)  The Buy America Preference applies to Federal awards where funds are appropriated or otherwise made available for infrastructure projects in the United States, regardless of whether infrastructure is the primary purpose of the Federal award.

    (b)  All Federal awards with infrastructure projects must include the Buy America Preference in the terms and conditions. The Buy America Preference must be included in all subawards, contracts, and purchase orders for the work performed, or products supplied under the Federal award. The terms and conditions of a Federal award flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise.

    (c)  Infrastructure encompasses public infrastructure projects in the United States, which includes, at a minimum, the structures, facilities, and equipment for roads, highways, and bridges; public transportation; dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime facilities; intercity passenger and freight railroads; freight and intermodal facilities; airports; water systems, including drinking water and wastewater systems; electrical transmission facilities and systems; utilities; broadband infrastructure; and buildings and real property; and structures, facilities, and equipment that generate, transport, and distribute energy including electric vehicle (EV) charging.

    (d)  The Federal agency should interpret the term “infrastructure” broadly and consider the description provided in paragraph (c) of this section as illustrative and not exhaustive. When determining if a particular project of a type not listed in the description in paragraph (c) constitutes “infrastructure,” the Federal agency should consider whether the project will serve a public function, including whether the project is publicly owned and operated, privately operated on behalf of the public, or is a place of public accommodation, as opposed to a project that is privately owned and not open to the public.

    (e)  (1) An article, material, or supply should only be classified into one of the following categories:

    (i) Iron or steel products;

    (ii) Manufactured products;

    (iii) Construction materials; or

    (iv) Section 70917(c) materials.

    (2) An article, material, or supply should not be considered to fall into multiple categories. In some cases, an article, material, or supply may not fall under any of the categories listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The classification of an article, material, or supply as falling into one of the categories listed in paragraph (e)(1) must be made based on its status at the time it is brought to the work site for incorporation into an infrastructure project. In general, the work site is the location of the infrastructure project at which the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials will be incorporated.

    (f)  An article, material, or supply incorporated into an infrastructure project must meet the Buy America Preference for only the single category in which it is classified.

    § 184.5   Determining the cost of components for manufactured products.

#### § § 184.5

    In determining whether the cost of components for manufactured products is greater than 55 percent of the total cost of all components, use the following instructions:

    (a) For components purchased by the manufacturer, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the manufactured product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or

    (b) For components manufactured by the manufacturer, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (a) of this section, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the manufactured product.

    § 184.6   Construction material standards.

#### § § 184.6

    (a) The Buy America Preference applies to the following construction materials incorporated into infrastructure projects. Each construction material is followed by a standard for the material to be considered “produced in the United States.”

    (1)  All manufacturing processes, from initial smelting or melting through final shaping, coating, and assembly, occurred in the United States.

    (2)  All manufacturing processes, from initial combination of constituent plastic or polymer-based inputs, or, where applicable, constituent composite materials, until the item is in its final form, occurred in the United States.

    (3)  All manufacturing processes, from initial batching and melting of raw materials through annealing, cooling, and cutting, occurred in the United States.

    (4)  All manufacturing processes, from the initial ribboning (if applicable), through buffering, fiber stranding and jacketing, occurred in the United States. All manufacturing processes also include the standards for glass and optical fiber, but not for non-ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based products, or any others.

    (5)  All manufacturing processes, from the initial preform fabrication stage through the completion of the draw, occurred in the United States.

    (6)  All manufacturing processes, from initial debarking through treatment and planing, occurred in the United States.

    (7)  All manufacturing processes, from initial blending of mined or synthetic gypsum plaster and additives through cutting and drying of sandwiched panels, occurred in the United States.

    (8)  All manufacturing processes from the initial combination of constituent materials until the wood product is in its final form, occurred in the United States.

    (b) Except as specifically provided, only a single standard under paragraph (a) of this section should be applied to a single construction material.

    § 184.7   Federal agency's issuance of a Buy America Preference waiver.

#### § § 184.7

    (a)  A Federal agency may waive the application of the Buy America Preference in any case in which it finds that:

    (1) Applying the Buy America Preference would be inconsistent with the public interest (a “public interest waiver”);

    (2) Types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality (a “nonavailability waiver”); or

    (3) The inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall infrastructure project by more than 25 percent (an “unreasonable cost waiver”).

    (b)  Recipients may request waivers from a Federal agency if the recipient reasonably believes a waiver is justified under paragraph (a) of this section. A request from a recipient to waive the application of the Buy America Preference must be provided to the Federal agency in writing. Federal agencies must provide waiver request submission instructions and guidance on the format, contents, and supporting materials required for waiver requests from recipients.

    (c)  Before issuing a proposed waiver, the Federal agency must prepare a detailed written explanation for the proposed determination to issue the waiver based on a justification listed under paragraph (a) of this section, including for waivers requested by a recipient.

    (d)  Before issuing a final waiver, the Federal agency must:

    (1) Make the proposed waiver and the detailed written explanation publicly available in an easily accessible location on a website designated by the Federal agency and the Office of Management and Budget;

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, provide a period of not less than 15 calendar days for public comment on the proposed waiver; and

    (3) Unless the Director of OMB provides otherwise, submit the waiver determination to the Made in America Office in OMB for final review pursuant to Executive Order 14005 and section 70923(b) of the Build America, Buy America Act.

    (e)  Waivers of general applicability mean waivers that apply generally across multiple Federal awards. A Federal agency must provide a period of not less than 30 days for public comment on a proposal to modify or renew a waiver of general applicability.

    § 184.8   Exemptions to the Buy America Preference.

#### § § 184.8

    (a) The Buy America Preference does not apply to expenditures for assistance authorized under section 402, 403, 404, 406, 408, or 502 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170a, 5170b, 16 5170c, 5172, 5174, or 5192) relating to a major disaster or emergency declared by the President under section 401 or 501, respectively, of such Act (42 U.S.C. 5170, 5191) or pre and post disaster or emergency response expenditures.

    (b) “Pre and post disaster or emergency response expenditures” consist of expenditures for financial assistance that are:

    (1) Authorized by statutes other than the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121  and

    (2) Made in anticipation of or response to an event or events that qualify as an “emergency” or “major disaster” within the meaning of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5122(1), (2).
