      § 1801.63   Scholar Accountability.

#### § § 1801.63

      (a) A Scholar selected after January 2005 must be employed in public service for three of the seven years following completion of his or her Foundation funded graduate education.

      (b) Following completion of Foundation funded graduate education, Scholars must submit a report to the Foundation by July 15 of each year. This report will include the Scholar's current contact information as well as a brief description of his or her employment during the past twelve months. This reporting requirement ends when the Foundation determines that a Scholar has reported three years of public service employment and the Foundation notifies him or her that he or she no longer is required to submit reports. Scholars who fail for two consecutive years to submit the required report to the Foundation will be considered to have failed to complete the three year public service requirement of paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) A Scholar who fails to be employed in public service for three out of the first seven years following completion of his or her Foundation funded graduate education must repay to the Foundation an amount equal to:

      (1) All of the Scholarship stipends received,

      (2) Interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of receipt of each payment until repayment is made to the Foundation, and

      (3) Reasonable collection fees.

      (d)(1) The repayment obligation of paragraph (c) of this section accrues on the first July 15 on which it becomes impossible for a Scholar to fulfill the three year public service requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. For example, the repayment obligation would accrue on July 15 of the sixth year following completion of Foundation funded graduate education for a Scholar who has been employed in the public service for only one of those six years.

      (2) The Foundation will send to the Scholar's last known address a notice that his or her repayment obligation has accrued. The failure, however, of the Foundation to send, or the Scholar to receive, such a notice does not alter or delay the Scholar's repayment obligation.

      (e) The Foundation may employ whatever remedies are available to it to collect any unpaid obligation accruing under this § 1801.63.

      (f) Upon application by the Scholar showing good cause for doing so, the Foundation may waive or modify the repayment obligation established by paragraph (c) of this section.

      (g) The Foundation will establish a process for appealing any disputes concerning the accrual of the repayment obligation imposed by paragraph (c) of this section. The Foundation will publish on its Web site  information about this appeals process and other information pertinent to repayment obligations accruing under this § 1801.63.

    (b) The seven-day period for the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced if a majority of the members of the Board or committee, as applicable, determine by a recorded vote that Board or committee business requires that such expedited meeting be called at an earlier date. The Board or committee shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.

    § 1802.6   Procedure for closing meetings.

#### § § 1802.6

    (a) Action to close a meeting or a portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions set forth in § 1802.4, shall be taken only when a majority of the entire voting membership of the Board or a majority of the entire voting membership of a committee, as applicable, vote to take such action. Any such action shall include a specific finding by the Board that an open meeting is not required by the public interest.

    (b) A separate vote of the Board or committee members shall be taken with respect to each Board or committee meeting, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to § 1802.4 or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under § 1802.4.

    (c) A single vote of the Board or committee may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series.

    (d) The vote of each member shall be recorded, and may be by notation voting, telephone polling or similar consideration.

    (e) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Board or a committee close such portion to the public under any of the exemptions relating to personal privacy, criminal accusation, or law enforcement information referred to in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of § 1802.4, the Board or committee, as applicable, upon request of any one of its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting. Where the Board receives such a request prior to a meeting, the Board may ascertain by notation voting, or similar consideration, the vote of each member of the Board, or committee, as applicable, as to the following:

    (1) Whether the business of the Board or committee permits consideration of the request at the next meeting, and delay of the matter in issue until the meeting following, or

    (2) Whether the members wish to close the meeting.

    (f) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (e), of this section, the Board or committee shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Board or committee shall, within one day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of its action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. The information required by this paragraph shall be disclosed except to the extent it is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 1802.4.

    (g) For every meeting closed pursuant to § 1802.4, the General Counsel of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation shall certify before the meeting may be closed that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the Board as part of the transcript, recording or minutes required by § 1802.7.

    § 1802.7   Transcripts, recordings, minutes of meetings.

    (b) Where minutes are maintained they shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons for such actions, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflecting the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.

    (c) The Board shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Board proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.

    (d) Public availability of records shall be as follows:

    (1) Within ten days of receipt of a request for information (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), the Foundation shall make available to the public, in the offices of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, 712 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any item of the testimony of any witness received at the meeting except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the General Counsel determines to contain information which may be withheld under § 1802.4.

    (3) The determination of the General Counsel to withhold information pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be appealed to the Board.

#### § § 1803.7

    (a) The Foundation shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not necessarily require the Foundation to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps, but no qualified individual with handicaps shall be denied the benefit of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any of the Foundation's programs and activities because any of the Foundation's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps.

    (b) When the Foundation uses facilities leased or otherwise provided by the General Services Administration (GSA), it shall request GSA to make any structural changes that the Foundation determines are required to provide necessary accessibility for individuals with handicaps, and shall inform that agency of any complaints regarding accessibility by individuals with handicaps.

    (c) The Foundation periodically uses meeting rooms or similar facilities made available by non-federal entities. In any instances in which such temporarily used facilities are not readily accessible to qualified individuals with handicaps, the Foundation shall make alternative arrangements so that such qualified individuals with handicaps can participate fully in the Foundation's activity.

    (d) This section does not require the Foundation to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administration burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter a program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Foundation has the burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) of this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Executive Secretary after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Foundation shall take other action not resulting in such an alteration or such burdens, but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the programs or activities.

    § 1803.8   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1803.8

The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

    § 1803.9   Employment.

#### § § 1803.9

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the Foundation. The definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

    § 1803.10   Communications.

#### § § 1803.10

    (a) The Foundation shall take appropriate steps to assure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can effectively communicate with the Foundation and obtain information as to the existence and availability of the Foundation's programs and activities.

    (1) The Foundation shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in the scholarship interview process or other programs or activities conducted by the Foundation.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Foundation shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.

    (ii) The Foundation need not provide individually prescribed devices or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) When the Foundation communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, the Foundation shall use, for persons with impaired hearing, a telecommunication device for deaf persons or equally effective telecommunication device.

    (b) The Foundation shall take appropriate steps to provide individuals with handicaps with information regarding their section 504 rights under the Foundation's programs or activities.

    (c) This section does not require the Foundation to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter a program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Foundation has the burden of proving that compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Executive Secretary after considering all Foundation resources available for use in the funding and operation of a conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Foundation shall take other action not resulting in such an alteration or such burdens, but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the programs or activities.

    § 1803.11   Compliance procedures.

#### § § 1803.11

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by the Foundation.

    (b) The Foundation shall process complaints alleging violations of § 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).

    (c) Responsibility for implementation and operation of this section shall be vested in the Executive Secretary.

    (d) The Foundation shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Foundation may extend this time period for good cause.

    (e) If the Foundation receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.

    (f) The Foundation shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is used by the Foundation that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.

    (g) The Foundation shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation within 90 days of the receipt of a complete complaint over which it has jurisdiction. Notification must be in a letter, and must include—

    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;

    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation discovered; and

    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.

    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by paragraph (f) of this section. The Foundation may extend this time for good cause.
