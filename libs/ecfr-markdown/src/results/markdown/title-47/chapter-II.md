    § 201.0   Background.

#### § § 201.0

    National policy with respect to the conservation, allocation and use of the Nation's telecommunications resources during crises and emergencies is set forth in Executive Order 12472. The following parts of this chapter address specific responsibilities with respect to management of telecommunications resources and related procedures which bear upon provision, restoration and continuity of telecommunications services during crises and emergencies. In doing so, the chapter encompasses both national security and emergency preparedness activities, consistent with Executive Order 12472. This concept of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services (as defined in § 201.2(g)) includes crises that do not necessarily entail serious degradation of, or serious threats to, national security. It therefore is a broader concept than the term “national security emergency preparedness activities” in Executive Order 12656, which concerns only national security emergencies, and preparedness activities necessarily related to such emergencies.

    § 201.1   Authority.

#### § § 201.1

    (a) Authorities and responsibilities related to and bearing upon national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications matters are set forth in:

    § 201.3   Policy.

#### § § 201.3

    (a) The Federal Government is responsible for resources mobilization, including determination of the need for and the extent of mobilization necessary in all crises and emergencies, wartime and non-wartime.

    (b) The President has limited non-wartime NS/EP telecommunications functions, and wartime NS/EP functions under the Communications Act of 1934 (as amended), which have been delegated to Federal agencies under Executive Order 12472. Federal, State, and local governments share the responsibility for conservation of the Nation's telecommunications resources.

    (1) The achievement of survival and recovery during a crisis or emergency would establish an unavoidable interdependence between and among Federal, State, and local authorities; therefore, there should be no barriers between Federal and State levels of authorities and between State and local levels of authorities which would impede, obstruct, or otherwise hinder effective conservation and equitable allocation of telecommunications resources and services to the needs of the Nation.

    (2) The Federal Government will rely upon State governments and their telecommunications management organizations for management or control of intrastate carrier services and continuity of interconnectivity with interstate carriers to assure that national objectives and priorities are properly served. Applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission govern the extent of the allocation of responsibility between Federal and State authorities for the management of NS/EP intrastate carrier services and the interconnectivity of intrastate services for NS/EP telecommunications functions.

    (c) A system of telecommunications service priorities will be established which facilitates the provisioning and early restoration of services considered vital to national interests during those events or crises which warrant NS/EP treatment.

    (d) The President is authorized during, or in anticipation of, an emergency or major disaster (as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 19/4) to establish temporary telecommunications systems and to make such telecommunications available to State and local government officials and such other persons as deemed appropriate (42 U.S.C. 5185).

    (e) The President also is authorized, during war, when necessary in the interest of national defense and security, to direct or establish priorities for essential communications with any commercial or governmental carrier and to prevent obstruction of telecommunications. The President may also suspend or amend rules and regulations, close stations and facilities, and authorize U.S. government use and control of telecommunications resources with regard to:

    (1) Radio communications (during war, or Presidentially declared threat of war, public peril, disaster or national emergency or a need to preserve the neutrality of the U.S.) and

    (2) Wire communications (during war or threat of war).

    (f) During an attack on the United States by an aggressor nation, and in an immediate postattack period, all decisions regarding the use of telecommunications resources will be directed to the objective of national survival and recovery. In order to achieve this objective, postattack resources will be assigned to activities concerned with the maintenance and saving of lives, immediate military defense and response, and economic activities essential to continued economic survival and recovery.

    (g) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will serve as the central authority to control, coordinate, and direct the activities of the Nation's telecommunications facilities, systems, and services during periods of wartime emergency as determined under section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.

    (h) Telecommunications resources of the Federal Government will be employed, as required, to best serve the continuity of government and national interests.

    (i) Federal agencies will, in the development of emergency operational plans, minimize, to the extent feasible, dependence upon telecommunications services for continuity of essential operations.

    § 202.0   Objectives.

#### § § 202.0

    (a) During, or in anticipation of, a non-wartime emergency or natural disaster, a telecommunications capacity must exist to provide temporary telecommunications service to State and local government officials and other persons deemed appropriate by the President.

    (b) In the event of a general war and attack upon the Nation, a national telecommunications capability must exist that will support telecommunications requirements with respect to national security, survival and recovery. The development of survivable telecommunications to support essential functions (including an emergency broadcasting system), and technical compatibility of signaling methods, transmission modes, switching facilities, and terminal devices to permit exchange of communications over the surviving media of all systems, government or commercial, are crucial elements of such a national capability. In addition, a survivable national telecommunications management structure is necessary to manage initiation, coordination and restoration of telecommunications services. The management structure must include the following:

    (1) Legal authority for telecommunications management.

    (2) A control mechanism to manage the initiation, coordination and restoration of telecommunications services.

    (3) Procedures to ensure timely damage assessment and allocation of residual resources and controlled restoration of services based on national policy/direction.

    (4) The capability to execute a telecommunications recovery plan based on national policy/guidance.

    (c) Notwithstanding any provision regarding NS/EP Planning and Execution, nothing in this part shall be deemed to affect the authorities or responsibilities of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or any Office or official thereof; or reassign any function assigned any agency under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, or under any other law, or any function vested by law in the Federal Communications Commission.

    § 202.1   Policies.

#### § § 202.1

    (a) The telecommunications resources of the Nation will be available for government use during crises and emergencies, wartime and non-wartime, and to satisfy the needs of the public welfare and safety.

    (b) The National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-Wartime Emergencies provides procedures for planning and using National telecommunications assets and resources in support of non-wartime emergencies, including those covered by the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, in Presidentially declared Emergencies and Major Disasters, Extraordinary Situations, and other emergencies.

    (c) An NS/EP Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System will provide procedures to authorize priority treatment for the provisioning and restoration of NS/EP telecommunications services for wartime and non-wartime emergencies.

    (d) In wartime emergencies, facilities management will remain decentralized to the extent feasible to assure continued flexibility of operational response to critical needs, subject to the management direction and overriding authority of those officials delegated to act for and with the consent of the central point of authority within the Federal Government.

    (1) Federally owned, leased, and/or operated telecommunications facilities, systems, and networks will be managed during such an emergency by the agency normally controlling the facility, system, or network except that all operations will be subject to the management direction and authority of the officials delegated overall management responsibility for Federal Government systems.

    (2) Facilities other than those of the Federal Government, with the exception of radio stations in the Aviation Services and certain classes of radio stations in the Maritime Services, will be managed by the authorized common carrier or other person owning and operating such facilities subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidance and direction or in accordance with State or local plans if not subject to FCC jurisdiction.

    (3) Radio stations in the Aviation Services and those aboard vessels in the Maritime Service will be subject to the control of the Secretary of Defense during a national emergency.

    (e) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is the single point of authority within the Federal Government for the wartime emergency functions under section 706 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 606) with respect to the allocation and use of surviving resources in support of national objectives enunciated by the President. Authority may be redelegated as necessary and when it can be exercised within boundaries established by Presidential authority.

    (f) Radio frequency utilization during a wartime emergency will be in accordance with authorizations, assignments, and mobilization plans in existence at the onset of the emergency. Subject to the overriding control of the Director, OSTP, under the President's War Emergency Powers, spectrum management regarding the authorization and assignment of radio frequencies will be made by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTLA) for the Federal Government, and the Director, OSTP, through the FCC, for all other entities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Radio stations are subject to closure if considered a threat to national security.

    (g) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, confers authority to the President in the matter of suspension of all rules and regulations pertaining to the use and operation of telecommunications facilities, public or private during wartime emergencies.

    § 202.2   Criteria and guidance.

#### § § 202.2

    NS/EP planning in government and industry with respect to effective conservation and use of surviving telecommunications resources in a disaster, emergency or postattack period must provide for orderly and uninhibited restoration of services by the carriers and authoritative control of services allocation which will assure that priority will be afforded the most critical needs of government and the private sector with respect to these objectives.

    (a) The preservation of the integrity of characteristics and capabilities of the Nation's telecommunications systems and networks during wartime or non-wartime emergencies is of the utmost importance. This can best be accomplished by centralized policy development, planning, and broad direction. Detailed operations management will remain decentralized in order to retain flexibility in the use of individual systems in responding to the needs of national security, survival and recovery. Each Federal agency responsible for telecommunications systems operations, and the carriers, are responsible for planning with respect to emergency operations. Guidance in this matter has been issued from a number of sources and contained in:

    (1) Annex C-XI (Telecommunications), Federal Emergency Plan D (Classified).

    (2) National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-wartime Emergencies.

    (3) The National Communications System Management Plan for Annex

    (b) The continuity of essential communications services will be maintained through the use of controls and operational procedures to assure that priority is given to vital services. NS/EP telecommunications services entail policies, procedures and responsibilities as described in parts 211 and 213 of this chapter.

    (c) The Nation's telecommunications systems facilities are vulnerable to physical and radiological damage. Planning factors with respect to the resumption of services in a disaster or postattack period must consider the probable loss of facilities which formerly provided direct and/or alternate intercity services among surviving population centers. Since surviving areas and population centers would serve as the sources of support to crippled areas of the Nation, the resumption of services between and among surviving metropolitan areas will be a high priority with the carriers.

    § 202.3   Plans preparation and execution.

#### § § 202.3

    Federal authority, substantive provisions, and functional responsibilities of the executive office are summarized in the following:

    (a)  (1) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (the National Security Advisor) shall provide general policy direction for the exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended, should the President issue implementing instructions in accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601).

    (2) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall direct the exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706(a), (c)-(e) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended, should the President issue implementing instructions in accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601).

**Authority:** Authority: 84 Stat. 2083 and Executive Order 12046, 43 FR, 13349  March 29, 1978.

**Source:** Source: 43 FR 50431, Oct. 30, 1978, unless otherwise noted.

    § 211.0   Purpose.

#### § § 211.0

    This part establishes policies and procedures under which government and private entities will be furnished restoration priorities to insure that leased intercity private line telecommunications services vital to the national interest will be maintained during the continuance of a war in which the United States engaged. It supersedes the Director of Telecommunications Management Order of January 15, 1967 (32 FR 791, 47 CFR part 201), which is hereby canceled. To assure the effective ability to implement its provisions, and also in order that government and industry resources may be used effectively under all conditions ranging from national emergencies to international crises, including nuclear attack, a single set of rules and procedures is essential, and they must be applied on a day-to-day basis so that the priorities they establish can be implemented at once when the occasion arises. As provided for in part 18 of Executive Order 11490, as amended (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 820), policies, plans, and procedures developed pursuant to the Executive order shall be in consonance with the plans and policies contained in this part.

    § 211.1   Authority.

#### § § 211.1

    (a) Authority to direct priorities for the restoration of communications services in national emergencies is vested in the President, including authority conferred by section 103 of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 404), section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2070), section 201 of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2281), section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, as amended (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 447), and section 606 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. (47 U.S.C. 606).

    (b) Authority to develop plans policies, and procedures for the establishment of such restoration priorities has been delegated to the National Security Council, by Executive Orders 11051, 11490, and by the President's Memorandum of August 21, 1963 (28 FR 9413, 3 CFR part 858 (1959-63 comp.)), all as amended by Executive Order 12046, (FR 43, 13349 ).

    (g)  means that system established by the President's Memorandum of August 21, 1963, “Establishment of a National Communications System” (28 FR 9413, 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 858).

    (h)  means the _Executive Agent_ of the National Communications System.

    (i)  means the Federal Communications _Commission_.

    § 211.3   Scope and coverage.

#### § § 211.3

    (a) The priority system and procedures established by this part are applicable to:

    (1) U.S. domestic leased intercity private line services, including private line switched network services;

    (2) U.S. international leased private line services to the point of foreign entry;

    (3) Foreign extensions of U.S. international leased private line services to the extent possible through agreement between U.S. carriers and foreign correspondents;

    (4) International leased private line services terminating in or transiting the United States;

    (5) Federal Government-owned and leased circuits.

    (b) The priority system and procedures established by this part are not applicable to operational circuits or order wires of the carriers needed for circuit reactivation and maintenance purposes, which shall have priority of restoration over all other circuits and shall be exempt from interruption for the purpose of restoring priority services.

    § 211.4   Policy.

#### § § 211.4

    During the continuance of a war in which the United States is engaged and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all communications common carriers shall comply with the following principles insofar as possible:

    (a) Whenever necessary to maintain or restore a service having a designated priority, services having lower priority, lower subpriority, or no priority, will be interrupted in the reverse order of priority starting with nonpriority services.

    (b) When services are interrupted to restore priority services, carriers will endeavor if feasible to notify users of the reason for the preemption.

    (c) When public correspondence circuits are needed to satisfy requirements for priority services, idle circuits will be selected first. A minimum number of public correspondence circuits shall at all times be kept available so as to provide for the transmission of precedence-type messages and calls.

    (d) Communications common carriers will not interrupt conversations having priority classification except insofar as necessary to restore services of higher priority.

    (e) It is recognized that as a practical matter in providing for the maintenance or restoration of a priority service or services operating within a multiple circuit-type facility (such as a carrier band, cable, or multiplex system), lower priority, lower subpriority, or nonpriority services on paralleled channels within a band or system may be restored concurrently with higher priority services. Such reactivation shall not, however, interfere with the expedited restoration of other priority services.

    (f) The Executive Agent is authorized to instruct the carriers on the percentage of government-switched network intermachine trunks to be restored to provide capacity for priority access line traffic.

    (g) The carriers are authorized to honor NCS-certified priorities from other authorized carriers for leased facilities.

    (h) The carriers are authorized to honor restoration priorities certified by the Executive Agent.

    (i) To ensure the effectiveness of the system of restoration priorities established by this part it is essential that rigorous standards be applied. Users are requested and directed to examine their private line service requirements in light of the criteria specified in this part and with regard to the availability of alternate communications facilities such as public correspondence message services, and Government-owned emergency communications systems.

    § 211.5   Priorities.

#### § § 211.5

    There are hereby established four levels of restoration priority. Within each level, subpriorities may be established by the Executive Agent, with the concurrence of the National Security Council, for both government and nongovernment services. The subpriorities categories currently in use, which have been established by the Executive Agent will remain in effect until modified. Compatibility of subcategories applicable to government and nongovernment users is essential to achieve the objective of a single restoration priority system.

    (a)  Priority 1 shall be the highest level of restoration priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign Government private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services which are designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this level of priority shall be limited to those esential to national survival if nuclear attack occurs for:

    (1) Obtaining or disseminating critical intelligence concerning the attack, or immediately necessary to maintain the internal security of the United States;

    (2) Conducting diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting or limiting of hostilities;

    (3) Executing military command and control functions essential to defense and retaliation;

    (4) Giving warning to the U.S. population;

    (5) Maintaining federal Government functions essential to national survival under nuclear attack conditions.

    (b)  Priority 2 shall be the second highest level of restoration priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign Government private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services which are designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those essential, at a time when nuclear attack threatens, to maintain an optimum defense posture and to give civil alert to the U.S. population. These are circuit requirements whose unavailability would present serious dangers:

    (1) Reducing significantly the preparedness of U.S. defense and retalitory forces;

    (2) Affecting adversely the ability of the United States to conduct critical preattack diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat of war;

    (3) Interfering with the effectual direction of the U.S. population in the interest of civil defense and survival;

    (4) Weakening U.S. capability to accomplish critical national internal security functions;

    (5) Inhibiting the provision of essential Federal Government functions necessary to meet a preattack situation.

    (c)  Priority 3 shall be the third highest level of restoration priority and shall be afforded to government, quais-government, and Industrial/Commercial private line services:  That Priority 3 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/Commercial, State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local government agencies only where, during an emergency, at least one station in the circuit (or in connected circuits if switched service is involved) will be manned continually, or where such circuits are automated and will be under constant surveillance from a remote location. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those necessary for U.S. military defense and diplomacy, for law and order, and for national health and safety in a national emergency involving heightened possibility of hostilities. These are curcuit requirements needed to:

    (1) Insure performance of critical logistic functions, public utility services, and administrative-military support functions;

    (2) Inform key diplomatic posts of the situation and of U.S. intentions;

    (3) Secure and disseminate urgent intelligence;

    (4) Distribute essential food and other supplies critical to health;

    (5) Provide for critical damage control functions;

    (6) Provide for hospitalization;

    (7) Continue critical Government functions;

    (8) Provide transportation for the foregoing activities.

    (d)  Priority shall be the fourth highest restoration priority and shall be afforded to government, quasi-government, and Industrial/Commercial private line services:  That Priority 4 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/Commercial, State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local government agencies only where, during an emergency, at least one station in the circuit (or in connected circuits if switched service is involved) will be manned continually, or where such circuits are automated and will be under constant surveillance from a remote location. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those necessary for the maintenance of the public welfare and the national economy in a situation short of nuclear attack, or during reconstitution after attack. These include circuit requirements needed to continue the more important financial, economic, health, and safety activities of the Nation.

    § 211.6   Submission and processing of restoration priority requests.

#### § § 211.6

    (a) Except as otherwise provided below, all requests for restoration priority assignments will be submitted to the Executive Agent in the format prescribed by him for processing and certification.

    (b) Priority 3 and 4 applications from county and municipal governments, quasi-state and local government agencies and private entities shall be forwarded to the Federal Communications Commission for its approval and for certification to the carriers. These submissions will be in the form prescribed by the Commission.

    (c) Industrial/Commercial entities designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national emergency should submit separate applications to the Commission when requesting the assignment of priorities in category 1 or 2. Such assignments will require the approval of the National Security Council in order to continue to be effective during a war emergency. In all cases the justification for restoration priorities will contain a validation statement from the Government agency with whom participation is prearranged.

    (d) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by Foreign Government agencies, except for NATO, NATO national military authority, and such other requests as the Executive Agent may be designated, will be submitted to the Department of State for initial evaluation and review. The Department will forward to the Executive Agent for processing and approval such of these requests as it finds acceptable.

    (e) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by NATO, NATO national military authority, and such other requests as the Executive Agent may designate, will be forwarded through established Allied Long Lines Agency (ALLA) channels to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary will forward to the Executive Agent for processing and approval such of these requests as he finds acceptable pursuant to approved NATO/U.S. procedures.

    (f) Requests for temporary upgrading of restoration priority assignments occasioned by special critical conditions, including natural disasters, heightened diplomatic and political tenseness, and tracking and control of manned space operations, may be submitted to the Executive Agent together with such information as he may require for expedited processing decision.

    (g) All assignments, denials and changes of restoration priorities and subpriorities are subject to review and modification by the National Security Council.

    (h) When requesting service from the carriers the user must include the certified restoration priority on the service authorization.

    § 211.7   Obligation of carriers.

#### § § 211.7

    (a) During the continuance of a war in which the United States is engaged, and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all carriers shall accord restoration priority assignments certified pursuant to this part priority over all other circuits.

    (b) To promote the national interest and defense preparedness, carriers shall:

    (1) Maintain such records of restoration priority assignments certified pursuant to this part as may be necessary to enable prompt implementation;

    (2) Enter into agreements, to the extent possible, with their foreign correspondents to effect restoration of the foreign portion of leased international services in accordance with this part;

    (3) Notify the Executive Agent of foreign correspondent procedures affecting Federal Government services that are not reasonably consistent with the priority requirements of this part.

**Source:** Source: 43 FR 50434, Oct. 30, 1978, unless otherwise noted.

    § 213.0   Authority.

#### § § 213.0

    (a) The voice and message precedence procedures for departments and agencies of the Federal Government prescribed by this part are prescribed pursuant to Executive Order No. 12046 (43 FR 13349 ) and the President's memorandum of August 21, 1963, which established the National Communications System (28 FR 9413; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 858).

    (b) The procedures applicable to communications common carriers and non-Federal Government users prescribed by this part are prescribed by authority conferred upon the President by subsection 606(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and delegated to the National Security Council by Executive Order 12046. That authority under section 606(a) may be exercised only during the continuance of a war in which the United States is engaged.

    § 213.1   Background and purpose.

#### § § 213.1

    (a) The National Security Council and the Federal Communications Commission have agreed upon a precedence system for the expeditious handling of messages and calls transmitted over Government and public correspondence facilities in all types of situations from peacetime to massive nuclear attack. Effectuation of that system requires that the Director issue a circular and that the Commission concurrently issue an order prescribing the standards, procedures, policies, and regulations that together, constitute this single integrated precedence system.

    (b) In conformity with that agreement the National Security Council is issuing this circular the purpose of which is to prescribe, on behalf of the President, that part of those standards, procedures, policies, and regulations which are within the cognizance of the NSC. No significance should be attached to the fact that slightly different terms are used in their circular from those used in the companion order of the FCC. Those differences result from differences in terms in the basic legal authorities of the director and the Commission rather than from an intent to denote a distinction in purpose or effect.

    § 213.2   Scope.

#### § § 213.2

    The precedence system contained herein is applicable to:

    (a) Users of Government service facilities, whether owned or leased.

    (b) Users of public correspondence service facilities of the communication common carriers, to U.S. domestic and international communication common carriers, and to the extent possible by agreement between the latter and their foreign correspondents.

    § 213.3   Cancellation.

#### § § 213.3

    This circular cancels:

    (a) Attachments A and B to Annex 3 of DMO 3000.1, dated November 8, 1963 (28 FR 12273).

    (b) That portion of the memorandum of the Special Assistant to the President for Telecommunications, dated August 27, 1964, pertaining to message precedences.

    § 213.4   Definitions.

#### § § 213.4

    As used herein:

    (a) Public correspondence services means those services offered to the general public for communications between all points served by a carrier or by interconnected carriers on a nonexclusive message by message or call by call basis, as differentiated from leased private line services.

    (b) The term  means the order in which messages and calls are processed. Transmission of information and call completion is therefore to be accomplished in the order required by the _precedence_ designator. Any such properly categorized communications precede noncategorized communications.

    (c) The term  where used alone means Federal, foreign, State, county, or municipal government agencies. Specific reference will be made whenever it is intended to apply to less than the whole, e.g.,  etc.

    (d) The term  includes those foreign diplomatic and consular establishments and those coalitions or associations of governments such as NATO, SEATO, OAS, UN, and associations of governments or governmental agencies such as Pan American Union, International Postal Union, International Monetary Fund, and similar organizations.

    (e) The term  means a written or other form of record communication prepared for transmission and delivery at the destination.

    (f) The term  means a request from a user for a connection to another station whether for telephone or record communication.

    § 213.5   Precedence designators.

#### § § 213.5

    (a) The following precedence designators are available for Government and public correspondence users:

    (b) Government and non-Government users of public correspondence services will handle their international messages in accordance with current ITU Telegraph Regulations. Government users should note that, generally, the only precedence designator available for their use for international messages sent over public correspondence circuits if Etat Priorite. The ITU Regulations do not contain precedence designators which equate to Flash, Immediate, or Priority. Accordingly, Government messages whether Flash, Immediate, or Priority precedence when sent over international public correspondence circuits will be handled as Etat Priorite messages. Thus, Priority messages will receive the same treatment in transmission and processing as Immediate or Flash messages. Conversely, Etat Priorite messages received in the United States shall be transmitted and processed in the order of receipt, to the extent possible. The precedence designator available for non-Government users of public correspondence services is Urgent. The Urgent designator is limited for use only during wartime conditions, as declared pursuant to section 606 of the Communications Act of 1934.

    (c) Domestic and International U.S. common carriers, insofar as practicable by agreement with their foreign correspondents, shall endeavor to arrange the proper level of precedence handling of international messages and calls originating, terminating in, or transiting the United States:  That insofar as international messages are concerned the level of precedence shall be consistent with the International Telecommunication Conventions and regulations thereunder.

    (d) The Government designators shall be used throughout the Federal Government. All messages and telephone calls sent via public correspondence services shall use domestic or international public correspondence designators as appropriate. Thus, the responsibility is on Government and public correspondence users to recognize and use the appropriate designators when using public correspondence services.

    (e) On international telephone calls the carrier's operator will convert to the appropriate international designator.

    § 213.6   Criteria.

#### § § 213.6

    (a)  (1) This is the highest order of precedence and shall be strictly limited to Federal and Foreign Government agencies.

    (2) Flash, or Flash Emergency telephone calls or messages shall be handled in the order received and ahead of all calls or messages except as indicated for international messages in ITU Regulations. When necessary to obtain a circuit for a Flash, or Flash Emergency call any call in progress of a lesser precedence will be interrupted, if feasible. Any message of a lesser precedence in the process of transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the channel for the Flash or Flash Emergency transmission. Flash or Flash Emergency precedence shall be reserved for calls and messages having an immediate bearing on:

    (i) Command and control of military forces essential to defense and retaliation.

    (ii) Critical intelligence essential to national survival.

    (iii) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting or limiting of hostilities.

    (iv) Dissemination of critical civil alert information essential to national survival.

    (v) Continuity of Federal governmental functions essential to national survival.

    (vi) Fulfillment of critical U.S. internal security functions essential to national survival.

    (vii) Catastrophic events of national or international significance, such as Presidential Action Notices essential to national survival during attack or preattack conditions.

    (b)  Immediate, Immediate Emergency, or Urgent telephone calls or messages shall be handled as fast as possible and ahead of all other calls or messages except those having a higher precedence. Any message or call of a lower precedence in the process of transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the channel for this transmission. It will be reserved generally for calls or messages pertaining to:

    (1) Situations which gravely affect the security of national and allied forces.

    (2) Reconstitution of forces in a postattack period.

    (3) Intelligence essential to national security.

    (4) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat of war.

    (5) Implementation of Federal Government actions essential to national survival.

    (6) Situations which gravely affect the internal security of the United States.

    (7) Civil defense actions concerning direction of our population and its survival.

    (8) Disasters or events of extensive seriousness having an immediate and detrimental effect on the welfare of the population.

    (9) Vital information having an immediate effect on aircraft, spacecraft, or missile operations.

    (c)  Priority, Priority Emergency, or Urgent messages and calls shall take precedence over messages or calls designated  or in the case of common carriers, over all nonprecedence traffic. Priority, Priority Emergency, or Urgent precedence is generally reserved for calls or messages which require expeditious action. Examples are calls or messages pertaining to:

    (1) Information on locations where attack is impending or where fire or air support will soon be placed.

    (2) Air-ground integrated operations.

    (3) Important intelligence.

    (4) Important diplomatic information.

    (5) Important information concerning the launch, operation, or recovery of spacecraft or missiles.

    (6) Movement of naval, air, and ground forces.

    (7) Coordination between governmental agencies concerning the performance of emergency preparedness functions.

    (8) Major civil aircraft accidents.

    (9) Maintaining the public health, safety, and the welfare of our population.

    (10) Critical logistic functions, provisions of critical public utility services, and administrative military support functions.

    (11) Distributing essential food and supplies critical to health.

    (12) Accomplishing tasks necessary to insure critical damage control functions.

    (13) Preparations for adequate hospitalization.

    (14) Continuity of critical Government functions.

    (15) Arranging minimum transportation for accomplishing the aforesaid functions.

    (16) Continuing or reestablishing our more important financial, economic, health, and safety activities. Producing, procuring, and distributing food materials and supplies which are considered necessary to the immediate support of a war effort, the national defense, or for expediting the means of meeting the effects of natural disasters.

    (17) Prompt delivery of information by press representatives to news media organizations and newspapers covering news of national or widespread disasters.

    (d)  Routine precedence designation applies to those normal day-to-day communications which require rapid transmission by telephone or message, but do not require urgent or preferential handling.

    § 213.7   Policies.

#### § § 213.7

    (a) Calls and messages in each precedence classification above shall have no precedence over others within the same classification, except where, within the same classification, they cannot be handled simultaneously. Then, they shall be handled in the order of their receipt.

    (b) Individuals whose requirements qualify them to use the precedence system share the responsibility for insuring its effectiveness. Users must familiarize themselves with the purposes to be served by the use of each precedence designator. It must be remembered that the entire system will operate successfully only if the use of the precedence designator is limited strictly to the intended purposes. Each user must consider whether each message or call requires any special precedence and exercise care not to specify a higher precedence than circumstances require.

    (c) For public correspondence message services, the domestic or international precedence designators shall be shown in full by the sender as the first word preceding the name of the addressee.

    (d) For public correspondence call services, the user should first attempt to complete the call in the normal manner. In the event the user is unable to complete the call and the type of communication falls within one of the precedence categories listed herein the call should be filed with an operator for completion and the user must specify the required precedence handling by stating that this is a Flash Emergency, Immediate Emergency, or Priority Emergency call, whichever the case may be.

    (e) Any apparent misuse of precedence indicators by non-Federal Government activities brought to the attention of the communication common carriers shall be referred to the FCC on and after-the-fact basis.

    (f) Any apparent misuse by Federal Government activities brought to the attention of the communication common carriers shall be referred to the Executive Agent, National Communications System. The Executive Agent will refer any matter which cannot be resolved with the cognizant Government activity to the National Security Council, for decision.

    (g) It is essential to provide public message and call capability for the transmission of military, governmental, and essential non-Government precedence messages and calls. Private line services for military, governmental, and other essential users are protected under a Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services promulgated by the FCC (FCC Order 67-51) and the National Security Council. However, during national emergencies, military, governmental, and other essential users will have additional requirements for prompt completion of precedence traffic over public correspondence communication common carrier facilities. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of the above-described Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services, communication common carriers shall have available a minimum number of public correspondence circuits at all times so as to provide for the transmission of precedence type messages and calls. Normally, the communication common carriers shall use their judgment in determining this number of circuits required for public correspondence precedence traffic. However, the authority is reserved to the National Security Council or the Federal Communications Commission, as appropriate to the time and situation, to revise the decisions of the carriers respecting the allocation of circuits, and to resolve any questions which are referred to them by the carriers or the users.

    § 213.8   Implementation.

#### § § 213.8

    Federal departments and agencies are authorized to issue such additional orders as are necessary to effect implementation of this circular.

    (b) In this connection, and concurrently with the war or national emergency proclamation by the President, the Director will:

    (1) Authorize the continuance of all frequency authorizations issued by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), except as they may otherwise be modified or revoked by the Director, OSTP, in the national interest;

    (2) Redelegate to the Secretary of Defense the authority necessary to control the use of the radio spectrum in areas of active combat, where such control is necessary to the support of U.S. military operations;

    (3) Close all non-government radio stations in the international broadcasting service as defined in the FCC rules and regulations, except those carrying or scheduled to carry U.S. Government-controlled radio broadcasts.

    § 214.5   Responsibilities.

#### § § 214.5

    (a) The Director, OSTP, will issue such policy guidance, rules, regulations, procedures, and directives as may be necessary to assure effective frequency usage during wartime emergency conditions.

    (b) The FCC, in coordination with NTIA, shall issue appropriate rules, regulations, orders, and instructions and take such other actions not inconsistent with the actions of the Director, OSTP, and the NTIA Emergency Readiness Plan for Use of the Radio Spectrum as may be necessary to ensure the effective use of those portions of the radio spectrum shared by Government and non-governments users.

    (c) The FCC shall assist the Director in the preparation of emergency plans pursuant to section 3(h)(3) of Executive Order 12472.

    (d) Each Federal Government agency concerned shall develop and be prepared to implement its own plans, and shall make necessary preemergency arrangements with non-government entities for the provision of desired facilities or services, all subject to the guidance and control of the Director.

    § 214.6   Postattack procedures and actions.

#### § § 214.6

    (a) The frequency management staff supporting the Director, OSTP, comprised of predesignated personnel from the frequency management staffs of the government user agencies, NTIA and the FCC, will have proceeded to the OSTP relocation site in accordance with alerting orders in force.

    (b) Government agencies having need for new radio frequency assignments or for modification of existing assignments involving a change in the frequency usage pattern shall, unless otherwise provided, submit applications therefor to the Director, OSTP, by whatever means of communication are available and appropriate, together with a statement of any preapplication coordination accomplished. The Director, OSTP, will review such applications accomplish the necessary additional coordination insofar as practicable, consider all pertinent views and comments, and grant or deny, as he shall determine, the assignment of such frequencies. All concerned will be informed promptly of his decisions.

    (c) Non-Government entities having need for new radio frequency assignments or for modifications of existing assignments will continue to submit applications therefor to the FCC, or in accordance with FCC instructions. Such applications shall be coordinated with the Director, OSTP, and granted subject to the approval of the Director, OSTP, or his delegate.

    (d) All changes of radio frequency usage within U.S. military theaters of operation will be coordinated with the Director, OSTP, where harmful interference is likely to be caused to stations authorized to operate within the United States and its possessions.

    (e) Where submission to the Director, OSTP, is impracticable, the applicant shall:

    (1) Consult the NTIA Emergency Readiness Plan for use of the Radio Spectrum and the Government Master File;

    (2) Accomplish such coordination as appropriate and possible;

    (3) Act in such manner as to have a minimum impact upon established services, accepting the responsibility entailed in taking the temporary action required;

    (4) Advise the Director, OSTP, as soon as possible of the action taken, and submit an application for retroactive approval.

    § 215.0   Purpose and authority.

#### § § 215.0

    The purpose of this part is to designate a focal point within the Federal Government for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) information concerning telecommunications. It is issued pursuant to the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, 42 FR 56101, 91 Stat. 1633, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix), Executive Order 12472, (49 FR 13471; 3 CFR, 1984 Comp., p. 193), “Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications, April 3, 1984 and Executive Order 12046, 43 FR 13349, “Relating to the Transfer of Telecommunications Functions,” May 27, 1978, as amended by Executive Order 12472.

    § 215.1   Background.

#### § § 215.1

    (a) The nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is part of the complex environment produced by nuclear explosions. It consists of transient voltages and currents which can cause malfunctioning and serious damage to electrical and electronic equipment.

    (b) The Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is the overall technical coordinator for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DOE laboratories on matters concerning nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons effects, and nuclear weapons testing. It acts as the focal point between the service laboratories and other agencies. The National Communications System (NCS), with the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), maintains a data base for telecommunications. DCA also provides the primary capability for the NCS to conduct telecommunications survivability studies for civil and military departments and agencies.

    (c) In order to disseminate among affected Federal agencies information concerning the telecommunications effects of EMP and available protective measures, and in order to avoid duplication of research efforts, it is desirable to designate a focal point within the Federal Government for telecommunications EMP matters.

    § 215.2   Assignment of responsibilities.

#### § § 215.2

    The Executive Agent, NCS, shall be the focal point within the Federal Government for all EMP technical data and studies concerning telecommunications. It shall provide such data and the results of such studies to all appropriate agencies requesting them. It shall coordinate and approve EMP telecommunications tests and studies, and shall keep the National Security Advisor informed regarding such tests and studies being conducted and planned.
