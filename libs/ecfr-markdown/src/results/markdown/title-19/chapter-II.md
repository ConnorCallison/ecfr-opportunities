        (b)  Rules in this chapter may be amended, waived, suspended, or revoked by the Commission only. A rule may be waived or suspended only when in the judgment of the Commission there is good and sufficient reason therefor, provided the rule is not a matter of procedure required by law.

Whenever any party or person, including the Commission staff, has reason to believe that (1) a matter under investigation pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, or (2) a matter under an investigation pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252), which is causing increased imports may come within the purview of another remedial provision of law not the basis of such investigation, including but not limited to the antidumping provisions (19 U.S.C. 1673 ) or the countervailing duty provisions (19 U.S.C. 1671 ) of the Tariff Act of 1930, then the party or person may file a suggestion of notification with the Commission that the appropriate agency be notified of such matter or circumstances, together with such information as the party or person has available. The Secretary shall promptly thereafter publish notice of the filing of such suggestion and information, and make them available for inspection and copying to the extent permitted by law. Any person may comment on the suggestion within 10 days after the publication of said notice. Thereafter, the Commission shall determine whether notification is appropriate under the law and, if so, shall notify the appropriate agency of such matters or circumstances. The Commission may at any time make such notification in the absence of a suggestion under this rule when the Commission has reason to believe, on the basis of information before it, that notification is appropriate under law.

        § 201.6   Confidential business information.

#### § § 201.6

        (a) —(1)  is information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of works, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, or amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization, or other information of commercial value, the disclosure of which is likely to have the effect of either impairing the Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to perform its statutory functions, or causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the Commission is required by law to disclose such information. The term “confidential business information” includes “proprietary information” within the meaning of section 777(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f(b)). Nonnumerical characterizations of numerical confidential business information (e.g., discussion of trends) will be treated as confidential business information only at the request of the submitter for good cause shown.

        (2)  is privileged information, classified information, or specific information ( trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure. Special rules for the handling of such information are set out in § 206.17 and § 207.7 of this chapter.

        (b)  (1) A request for confidential treatment of business information shall be addressed to the Secretary, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall indicate clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.

        (2) In the absence of good cause shown, any request relating to material to be submitted during the course of a hearing shall be submitted at least three (3) working days prior to the commencement of such hearing.

        (3) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential business information, under paragraph (a) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public:

        (i) A written description of the nature of the subject information;

        (ii) A justification for the request for its confidential treatment;

        (iii) A certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public;

        (iv) A copy of the document

        (A) Clearly marked on its cover as to the pages on which confidential information can be found;

        (B) With information for which confidential treatment is requested clearly identified by means of brackets; and

        (C) With information for which nondisclosable confidential treatment is requested clearly identified by means of triple brackets (except when submission of such document is withheld in accord with paragraph (b)(4) of this section); and

        (v) A nonconfidential copy of the documents as required by § 201.8(d).

        (4) The submission of the documents itemized in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will provide the basis for rulings on the confidentiality of submissions, including rulings on the confidentiality of submissions offered to the Commission which have not yet been placed under the possession, control, or custody of the Commission. The submitter has the option of providing the business information for which confidential treatment is sought at the time the documents itemized in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are provided or of withholding them until a ruling on their confidentiality has been issued.

        (c)  Business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential shall be clearly labeled “confidential business information” when submitted, and shall be segregated from other material being submitted.

        (d)  Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Secretary or Acting Secretary. An approval or a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing. A denial shall specify the reason therefor, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.

        (e)  (1) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of a denial or whenever the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person requesting confidential treatment.

        (2) An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an extension notice in writing with the reasons therefor, has been provided the person making the appeal.

        (3) The justification submitted to the Commission in connection with an appeal shall be limited to that presented to the Secretary with the original or amended request. When the Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied a request on the ground that the submitter failed to provide adequate justification, any such additional justification shall be submitted to the Secretary for consideration as part of an amended request. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the twenty (20) day period for filing an appeal shall be tolled on the filing of an amended request and a new twenty (20) day period shall begin once the Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied the amended request, or the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days of the filing of the amended request. A denial of a request by the Secretary on the ground of inadequate justification shall not obligate a requester to furnish additional justification and shall not preclude a requester from filing an appeal with the Commission based on the justification earlier submitted to the Secretary.

        (f)  (1) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from an approval by the Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, shall show that a copy thereof has been served upon the submitter, and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of the approval by the Secretary of a request for confidential treatment or whenever the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person requesting confidential treatment.

        (2) An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an extension notice, in writing with the reasons therefor, has been provided the person making the appeal.

        (g)  Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event that any business information submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw the tender within five days of its denial of confidential treatment unless it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings. After such five day period, the business information deemed not entitled to confidential treatment, and not withdrawn, will be treated as public information.

        (h)  The provisions of §§ 201.6(b) and 201.6 (d) through (g) shall not apply to adjudicative investigations under subchapter C, part 210, of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure.

        (2)  The Commission, one or more of the Commissioners, or one or more designated employees shall have all the powers to conduct fair and impartial hearings, to take necessary action to avoid delay in the disposition of proceedings, including the prescription of time allocated to testimony, argument, and questioning, to regulate the course of hearings and the conduct of the parties and their counsel therein, and to maintain order.

        (c) —(1)  A party may participate in the hearing, either in person or by representative. A nonparty who has testimony or arguments that may aid the Commission's deliberations may also participate, under such conditions as may be established by the presiding officials at the hearing.

        (2)  Notices of participation in a hearing shall be filed with the Secretary at least three (3) days in advance of the date set for the hearing or two (2) days in advance of the date set in the notice of investigation for a prehearing conference, whichever shall first occur, except that the presiding officials may waive this requirement for good cause. Witnesses on behalf of persons filing notices of participation need not file separate notices.

        (d)  Each person who files a notice of participation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall simultaneously file with the Secretary a list of the witnesses he intends to call at the hearing.

        (e)  Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officials, witnesses will give testimony in the order designated by the Secretary to the Commission. Each witness, after being duly sworn, will be permitted to proceed with his or her testimony without interruption except by presiding officials.

        (f)  A party to the investigation may file with the Secretary _supplementary material_, other than remarks read into the record, for acceptance into the record. The party shall file any such material with the Secretary at the hearing. Supplementary materials must be marked with the name of the organization submitting it. As used herein, the term  refers to (1) additional graphic material such as charts and diagrams used to illuminate an argument or clarify a position and (2) information not available to a party at the time its prehearing brief was filed.

        (g)  After completing testimony, a witness may be questioned by any member of the Commission or by its staff. Any participant may, with the permission of the presiding officials, direct questions to the witness, but only for the purpose of assisting the Commission in obtaining relevant and material facts with respect to the subject matter of the investigation.

        (h)  When, in the opinion of the presiding officials, time permits and the nature of the proceedings and the complexity or importance of the questions of fact or law involved warrant, the presiding officials may allow oral argument after conclusion of the testimony in a hearing. The presiding officials will determine in each instance the time to be allowed for argument and the allocation thereof.

        (i) —(1)  _Briefs_ of the information produced at the hearing and arguments thereon may be presented to the Commission by parties to the investigation. Time to be allowed for submission of briefs will be set after conclusion of testimony and oral argument, if any.

        (2)  Any person who is not a party to an investigation may submit a short statement for the record regarding the subject matter of an investigation.

        (j)  Oral or written information submitted at hearings will, upon order of the Commission, be subject to verification from books, papers, and records of the persons submitting the information and from any other available sources.

        (k)  A verbatim transcript of all hearings will be taken. The Commission does not distribute transcripts of the records of such hearings. Any person may inspect the transcript of a hearing at the Commission's office in Washington, DC, or purchase it from the official reporter.

        (l) To facilitate the conduct of hearings, parties intending to use easels, audio visual, and similar equipment in the course of hearing presentations should advise the Secretary of their intent to use such equipment at least three (3) working days before the hearing.

        (m)  (1) Upon a request filed by a party to the investigation no later than seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing (or three (3) days prior to the date of a conference conducted under § 207.15 of this chapter) that

        (i) Identifies the subjects to be discussed;

        (ii) Specifies the amount of time requested; and

        (iii) Justifies the need for a closed session with respect to each subject to be discussed, the Commission (or the Director, as defined in § 207.2(c) of this chapter, for a conference under § 207.15 of this chapter) may close a portion of a hearing (or conference under § 207.15 of this chapter) held in any investigation in order to allow such party to address confidential business information, as defined in § 201.6, during the course of its presentation.

        (2) In addition, during each hearing held in an investigation conducted under section 202 of the Trade Act, as amended, or in an investigation under title VII of the Tariff Act as provided in § 207.24 of this chapter, following the public presentation of the petitioner(s) and that of each panel of respondents, the Commission will, if it deems it appropriate, close the hearing in order to allow Commissioners to question parties and/or their representatives concerning matters involving confidential business information.

        § 201.14   Computation of time, additional hearings, postponements, continuances, and extensions of time.

#### § § 201.14

        (a)  Computation of any period of time prescribed or allowed by the rules in this chapter, by order of the Commission, or by order of the presiding officer under part 210 of this chapter shall begin with the first business day following the day on which the act or event initiating such period of time shall have occurred. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next business day. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation. As used in this rule, a Federal legal holiday refers to any full calendar day designated as a legal holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States. In the event of an early or all-day closing of the Commission on a business day, the Secretary is authorized to accept on the next full business day filings due the day of the early or all-day closing, without requiring the granting of an extension of time by the Chairman of the Commission, or such other person designated to conduct the investigation.

        (b)  (1) Prior to its final determination in any investigation, the Commission may in its discretion for good cause shown grant additional hearings, postponements, or continuances of hearings.

        (2) The Chairman of the Commission or such other person as is designated to conduct the investigation shall determine whether to grant for good cause shown extensions of time for performing any act required by or pursuant to the rules contained in this chapter.

        (3) A request that the Commission take any of the actions described in this section shall be filed with the Secretary and served on all parties to the investigation. Such request shall be filed electronically and two (2) true paper copies shall be submitted on the same business day.

        § 201.15   Attorneys or agents.

#### § § 201.15

        (a)  No register of attorneys or agents who may practice before the Commission is maintained. No application for admission to practice is required. Any person desiring to appear as attorney or agent before the Commission may be required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission his acceptability in that capacity. Any attorney or agent practicing before the Commission, or desiring so to practice, may for good cause shown be suspended or barred from practicing before the Commission, or have imposed on him such lesser sanctions as the Commission deems appropriate, but only after he has been accorded an opportunity to present his views in the matter.

        (b)  No former officer or employee of the Commission who personally and substantially participated in a matter which was pending in any manner or form in the Commission during his employment shall be eligible to appear before the Commission as attorney or agent in connection with such matter. No former officer or employee of the Commission shall be eligible to appear as attorney or agent before the Commission in connection with any matter which was pending in any manner or form in the Commission during his employment, unless he first obtains written consent from the Commission.

        § 201.16   Service of process and other documents.

#### § § 201.16

        (a)  Except when service by another method shall be specifically ordered by the Commission, the service of a process or other document of the Commission shall be served by anyone duly authorized by the Commission and be effected—

        (1) By mailing, delivering, or serving by electronic means a copy of the document to the person to be served, to a member of the partnership to be served, to the president, secretary, other executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the corporation, association, or other organization to be served, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by mailing, delivering, or serving by electronic means a copy to such attorney; or

        (2) By leaving a copy thereof at the principal office of such person, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by leaving a copy at the office of such attorney.

        (3) By using an express delivery service to send a copy of the document to the principal office of such person, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by serving the attorney by express delivery.

        (4) When service is by mail, it is complete upon mailing of the document. When service is by an express service, service is complete upon submitting the document to the express delivery service or depositing it in the appropriate container for pick-up by the express delivery service. When service is by electronic means, service is complete upon transmission of a notification that the document has been placed in an appropriate repository for retrieval by the person, organization, representative, or attorney being served, unless the Commission is notified that the notification was not received by the party served.

        (b)  Except when service by another method shall be specifically ordered by the Commission, the service of a document of a party shall be effected:

        (1) By mailing or delivering a copy of a nonconfidential version of the document to each party, or, if the party is represented by an attorney before the Commission, by mailing or delivering a nonconfidential version thereof to such attorney; or

        (2) By leaving a copy thereof at the principal office of each other party, or, if a party is represented by an attorney before the Commission, by leaving a copy at the office of such attorney.

        (3) When service is by mail, it is complete upon mailing of the document.

        (4) When service is by mail, it shall be by first class mail, postage prepaid. In the event the addressee is outside the United States, service shall be by first class airmail, postage prepaid.

        (c)  (1) Each document filed with the Secretary to the Commission by a party in the course of an investigation (as provided in § 201.8 of this part) shall be served on each other party to the investigation (as provided in § 210.4(i) of this chapter for investigations under 19 U.S.C. 1337).

        (2) Each document served by a party shall include a certificate of service, setting forth the manner and date of such service. The certificate of service shall be deemed proof of service of the document. In the event a document is not accompanied by a certificate of service, the Secretary shall not accept such document for filing and shall promptly notify the submitter.

        (d)  Whenever a party or Federal agency or department has the right or is required to perform some act or take some action within a prescribed period after the service of a document upon it and the document is served upon it by mail, three (3) calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period, except that when mailing is to a person located in a foreign country, ten (10) calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period.

        (e)  Whenever a party or Federal agency or department has the right or is required to perform some act or take some action within a prescribed period after the service of a document upon it and the document is served by express delivery, one (1) day shall be added to the prescribed period if the service is to a destination in the United States, and five (5) days shall be added to the prescribed period if the service is to a destination outside the United States. “Service by express delivery” refers to a method that would provide delivery by the next business day within the United States and refers to the equivalent express delivery service when the delivery is to a foreign location.

        (f)  Parties may serve documents by electronic means in all matters before the Commission. Parties may effect such service on any party, unless that party has, upon notice to the Secretary and to all parties, stated that it does not consent to electronic service. If electronic service is used, no additional time is added to the prescribed period. However, any dispute that arises among parties regarding electronic service must be resolved by the parties themselves, without the Commission's involvement. When a document served by electronic means contains confidential business information or business proprietary information subject to an administrative protective order, the document must be securely stored and transmitted by the serving party in a manner, including by means ordered by the presiding administrative law judge, that prevents unauthorized access and/or receipt by individuals or organizations not authorized to view the specified confidential business information.

      Subpart C—Availability of Information to the Public Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552

**Authority:** Authority: 19 U.S.C. 1335, 5 U.S.C. 552.

**Source:** Source: 40 FR 8328, Feb. 27, 1975, unless otherwise noted.

        § 201.17   Procedures for requesting access to records.

#### § § 201.17

        (a)  (1) A request for any information or record shall be addressed to the Secretary, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436 and shall indicate clearly in the request, and if the request is in paper form on the envelope, that it is a “Freedom of Information Act Request.” A written request may be made either (1) in paper form, or (2) electronically by contacting the Commission at

        (2) Any request shall reasonably describe the requested record to facilitate location of the record. If the request pertains to a record that is part of the Commission's file in an investigation, the request should identify the investigation by number and name. A clear description of the requested record(s) should reduce the time required by the Commission to locate and disclose releasable responsive record(s) and minimize any applicable search and copying charges.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, requests will be processed in the order in which they are filed.

        (4) Requests for transcripts of hearings should be addressed to the official hearing reporter, the name and address of which can be obtained from the Secretary. A copy of such request shall at the same time be forwarded to the Secretary.

        (5) Copies of public Commission reports and other publications are available online at  or can be requested by calling or writing the Office of the Secretary. Certain Commission publications are sold by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, and are available from that agency at the price set by that agency.

        (6) A day-to-day, composite record will be kept by the Secretary of each request with the disposition thereof.

        (b)  (1) Requests for records under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:

        (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

        (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;

        (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

        (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

        (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time.

        (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester within paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.

        (4) Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Secretary will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.

        (c)  The Commission maintains a public reading room in the Office of the Secretary for access to the records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection and copying. Reading room records created by the Commission on or after November 1, 1996, are available electronically. This includes a current subject-matter index of reading room records, which will indicate which records are available electronically.

        (d)  The Secretary will provide to a requester an acknowledgment of the receipt of a request and an individualized tracking number for each request. The requester may obtain information about the status of the request and/or contact the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison by telephone (202-205-2595) or email (). The FOIA Public Liaison is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.

        (e)  The FOIA applies to third-party requests for documents concerning the general activities of the government and of the Commission in particular. When a U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence requests access to his or her own records,  makes a first-party request, it is considered a Privacy Act request. Although requests are considered either FOIA requests or Privacy Act requests, the Commission processes first-party requests in accordance with both laws, which provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal privacy.

        (f)  If the Secretary refers a request or a portion thereof to another agency, the Secretary will notify the requester of the referral and the part of the request that has been referred. If feasible, the Secretary will provide the requester with a point of contact within the receiving agency regarding the referral.

        (g)  (1) The Secretary shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to requests received as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by a General Records Schedule of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or other NARA-approved records schedule.

        (2) Materials that are identified as responsive to a FOIA request will not be disposed of or destroyed while the request or a related appeal or lawsuit is pending. This is true even if they would otherwise be authorized for disposition under a General Records Schedule or other NARA-approved records schedule.

        § 201.18   Denial of requests, appeals from denial.

#### § § 201.18

        (a) Written requests for inspection or copying of records shall be denied only by the Secretary or Acting Secretary, or, for records maintained by the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General. A denial shall be in writing and shall provide information on the exemptions that justify withholding and the amount of information withheld. The denial also shall advise the person requesting of the right to appeal to the Commission.

        (b) An appeal from a denial of a request must be received within ninety days of the date of the letter of denial and shall be made to the Commission and addressed to the Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. Any such appeal shall be in writing, and shall indicate clearly in the appeal, and if the appeal is in paper form on the envelope, that it is a “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” An appeal may be made either in paper form, or electronically by contacting the Commission at

        (c) Except when expedited treatment is requested and granted, appeals will be decided in the order in which they are filed, but in any case within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) unless an extension, noticed in writing with the reasons therefor, has been provided to the person making the request. Notice of the decision on appeal and the reasons therefor will be made promptly after a decision. Requests for expedited treatment should conform with the requirements in § 201.17(c) of this part.

        (d) The extensions of time mentioned in paragraph (c) of this section shall be made only for one or more of the following reasons:

        (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

        (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are requested in a single communication; or

        (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having a substantial subject-matter interest therein.

        (e) The extensions of time mentioned in paragraph (c) of this section shall not exceed ten working days in the aggregate.

        (f) A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison officer and the Office of Government Information Services both offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. The requester may contact the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison officer by telephone (202-205-2595) or email () or the Office of Government Information Services at National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road—OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.

        § 201.19   Notification regarding requests for confidential business information.

#### § § 201.19

        (a)  Business information provided to the Commission by a business submitter which the Commission has designated as “confidential business information” will not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request except in accordance with this section.

        (b)  The following definitions are to be used in reference to this section:

        means commercial or financial information that has been designated as confidential business information by the Commission under § 201.6 of this part.

        means any person or entity who provides confidential business information, directly or indirectly, to the Commission. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, producers, importers, and state and federal governments, as well as others who have an administrative relationship with the Commission such as contractors, bidders and vendors.

        (c)  Except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the Commission will, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing its confidential business information whenever required under paragraph (d) of this section, in order to afford the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. Such written notice will describe the nature of the confidential business information requested. The requester will also be notified that notice and opportunity to object to are being provided to a submitter.

        (d)  Notice will be given to a submitter in writing at submitter's last known address whenever:

        (1) The information the subject of the FOIA request or appeal has been designated by the Commission as confidential business information; and

        (2) The Commission has reason to believe that the information may not be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemptions 3 or 4.

        (e)  The notice requirements of paragraph (c) of this section will not apply if:

        (1) The Commission determines that the information should not be disclosed;

        (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; or

        (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).

        (f)  Through the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission will afford a submitter an opportunity, within the period afforded to the Commission to make its decision in response to the FOIA request, to provide the Commission with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall be filed by a deadline set by the Secretary, and it shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of FOIA. In the case of FOIA Exemptions 3 or 4, it shall demonstrate why the information should continue to be considered confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6 of this part and should not be disclosed. The submitter's claim of continued confidentiality should be supported by a certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

        (g)  The Commission will consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information. Whenever the Commission decides to disclose such information over the objection of a submitter, the Commission will forward to the submitter a written notice which will include:

        (1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;

        (2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

        (3) A specified disclosure date.

        (h)  Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of information that the Commission has designated as confidential business information, the Commission will promptly notify the submitter at its last known address. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Secretary may assume such address to be that given on the submission.

        § 201.20   Fees.

#### § § 201.20

        (a)  Fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered by agency personnel in responding to and processing requests for records under this subpart. All fees so assessed shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph (c) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (d) of this section. The Secretary will collect all applicable fees. Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

        (b)  In responding to requests under this subpart, the following fees shall be assessed, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section:

        (1)  (i) No search fee shall be assessed with respect to requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news media as defined in paragraphs (j) (6), (7), and (8) of this section, respectively. Search fees shall be assessed with respect to all other requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section. The secretary may assess fees for time spent searching even if agency personnel fail to locate any respective record or where records located are subsequently determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.

        (ii) For each quarter hour spent by agency personnel in salary grades GS-2 through GS-10 in searching for and retrieving a requested record, the fee shall be $4.00. When the time of agency personnel in salary grades GS-11 and above is required, the fee shall be $6.50 for each quarter hour of search and retrieval time spent by such personnel.

        (iii) For computer searches of records, which may be undertaken through the use of existing programming, requester shall be charged the actual direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search (at no more than $6.50 per quarter hour of time so spent).

        (2)  Duplication fees shall be assessed with respect to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee shall be $0.10 per page. For copies produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the Secretary shall charge the actual direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other methods of duplication, the Secretary shall charge the actual direct costs of duplicating a record.

        (3)  (i) Review fees shall be assessed with respect to only those requesters who seek records for a commercial use, as defined in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. For each quarter hour spent by agency personnel in reviewing a requested record for possible disclosure, the fee shall be $6.50.

        (ii) Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record review, i.e., all of the review undertaken when a component analyzes the applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. However, records or record portions withheld pursuant to an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs of such a subsequent review are properly assessable, particularly where that review is made necessary by a change of circumstances.

        (c)  (1) No search or review fee shall be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

        (2) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use (as defined in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), the Secretary shall provide without charge—

        (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent), and

        (ii) The first two hours of search (or its cost equivalent).

        (3) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (b) of this section is $25.00 or less, no fee shall be charged.

        (4) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section work together. For requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, no fee shall be charged unless the cost of search is in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages exceeds $25.00.

        (5) The Commission will not charge fees if it fails to comply with any time limit under the FOIA or these regulations, and if it has not timely notified the requester, in writing, that an unusual circumstance exists. If an unusual circumstance exists, and timely written notice is given to the requester, the Commission will have an additional 10 working days to respond to the request before fees are automatically waived under this paragraph.

        (6) If the Commission determines that unusual circumstances apply and that more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to a request, it may charge fees if it has provided a timely written notice to the requester and discusses with the requester via mail, Email, or telephone how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request (or make at least three good faith attempts to do so).

        (7) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with time limits imposed by these regulations or FOIA shall be excused for the length of time provided by court order.

        (d)  (1) Records responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (b) of this section where the Secretary determines, based upon information provided by a requester in support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Secretary that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.

        (2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government—the Secretary shall consider the following four factors in sequence:

        (i)  The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government—with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their informative value with respect to those government operations or activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic informational content alone will not satisfy this threshold consideration.

        (ii)  The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative on specific government operations or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increased public understanding of those operations and activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public record.

        (iii)  The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons. A requester's identity and qualifications—e.g., expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the general public—shall be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media (as defined in paragraph (j)(8) of this section) who has access to the means of public dissemination readily will be able to satisfy this consideration. Requests from libraries or other record repositories (or requesters who intend merely to disseminate information to such institutions) shall be analyzed, like those of other requesters, to identify a particular person who represents that he actually will use the requested information in scholarly or other analytic work and then disseminate it to the general public.

        (iv)  The public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The Secretary shall not make separate judgments as to whether information, even though it in fact would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, is “important” enough to be made public.

        (3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester—the Secretary shall consider the following two factors in sequence:

        (i)  The Secretary shall consider all commercial interests of the requester (with reference to the definition of  in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), or any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, but shall consider only those interests which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercial interests, consideration shall be given to the role that such FOIA-disclosed information plays with respect to those commercial interests, as well as to the extent to which FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall. Requesters shall be given a reasonable opportunity in the administrative process to provide information bearing upon this consideration.

        (ii)  A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where, once the “public interest” standard set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is satisfied, that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude than that of the requester's commercial interest in disclosure. The Secretary shall ordinarily presume that, where a news media requester has satisfied the “public interest” standard, that will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the “public interest.”

        (4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.

        (5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each of the factors listed in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, as they apply to each record request.

        (e)  Where the Secretary determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section may amount to more than $25.00, he shall notify the requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. (If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Secretary shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.) In cases where a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to more than $25.00, the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice of the requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offer him the opportunity to confer with agency personnel in order to reformulate his request to meet his needs at a lower cost.

        (f)  Where the Secretary reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Secretary may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. The Secretary may presume that multiple requests of such type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to evade fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, the Secretary shall aggregate them only where there exists a reasonable basis for determining that said aggregation is warranted, e.g., where the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated

        (g)  (1) Where the Secretary estimates that a total fee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00, the Secretary may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the entire estimated fee before beginning to process the request, except where the Secretary receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

        (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a records access fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Secretary may require the requester to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest (as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section), and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any estimated fee before he begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.

        (3) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the Secretary shall not require the requester to make an advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed on work already completed is not an advance payment.

        (4) Where the Secretary acts under paragraph (g) (1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limits described in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA for the processing of an initial request or an appeal, plus permissible extensions of these time limits, shall be deemed not to begin to run until the Secretary has received payment of the assessed fee.

        (h)  The Secretary may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent to the requester. Once a fee payment has been received by the Secretary, even if not processed, the accrual of interest shall be stayed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and shall accrue from the date of the billing. The Secretary shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-265 (Oct. 25, 1982), and its implementing procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

        (i)  (1) The fee schedule of this section does not apply with respect to the charging of fees under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records—i.e., any statute that specifically requires a government entity such as the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service, to set and collect fees for particular types of records—in order to:

        (i) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by conveniently making available government information;

        (ii) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications and other services that are for their special use so that these costs are not borne by the general taxpaying public;

        (iii) Operate an information-dissemination activity on a self-sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or

        (iv) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriate funds used to pay the costs of disseminating government information.

        (2) Where records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutorily based fee schedule programs, the Secretary shall inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from those sources.

        (j)  For the purpose of this section:

        (1) The term  means those expenditures which the agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in _direct costs_ are overhead expenses such as costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.

        (2) The term  includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. The Secretary shall ensure, however, that _search_es are undertaken in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible; thus, for example, the Secretary shall not engage in line-by-line search where merely duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less expensive.

        (3) The term  refers to the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.

        (4) The term  refers to the process of examining a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any record for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise it and otherwise prepare it for release, although _review_ costs shall be recoverable even where there ultimately is no disclosure of a record. Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

        (5) The term  in the context of a request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Secretary shall determine, as well as reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the records requested. Where the circumstances of a request suggest that the requester will put the records sought to a _commercial use_, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the Secretary otherwise has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the Secretary shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.

        (6) The term  refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research.

        (7) The term  refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (j)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scientific research.

        (8) The term  refers to any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term 'news' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of 'news') who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.

        (9) The term  means one of the three categories that requesters are placed in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, including commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.

        (10) The term  means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.

        (k)  Apart from the other provisions of this section, where the Secretary elects, as a matter of administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special service or materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or sending them other than by ordinary mail, the actual direct costs of providing the service or materials shall be charged.

        § 201.21   Availability of specific records.

#### § § 201.21

        (a)  The following information, on request to the Secretary of the Commission, is available for public inspection and copying: (1) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases; (2) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency; and (3) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public. Available information includes, but is not limited to: (i) Applications, petitions, and other formal documents filed with the Commission, (ii) notices to the public concerning Commission matters, (iii) transcripts of testimony taken and exhibits submitted at hearings, (iv) reports to the President, to either or both Houses of Congress, or to Committees of Congress, release of which has been authorized by the President or the legislative body concerned, (v) reports and other documents issued for general distribution. Much of the information described above also is available on the Commission's World Wide Web site. The Commission's home page is at  The Web site also includes information subject to repeated Freedom of Information Act requests. Persons accessing the Web site can find instructions on how to locate Commission information by following the “Freedom of Information Act” link on the home page.

        (b)  Information specifically exempted from disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b), including reports to the President, to either or both Houses of Congress, or to Committees of Congress, the release of which has not been authorized by the President or the legislative body concerned, and confidential business data as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 19 CFR 201.06 are not available to the public.

        (c)  (1) The procedure specified in this section will apply to all _demand_s directed to Commission _employee_s for the production of _documents_ or for testimony that relates in any way to the employees' official duties. These procedures will also apply to demands directed to former employees if the demands seek _nonpublic_ materials or information acquired during Commission employment. The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section will also apply to demands directed to the agency. For purposes of this section, the term  means any request, order or _subpoena_ for testimony or production of documents; the term  means any compulsory process in a _case or matter_ to which the Commission is not a party; the term  includes any material or information which, under § 201.21(b), is exempt from availability for public inspection and copying; the term  means any current or former officer or employee of the Commission; the term  means all records, papers or official files, including without limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda, reports, studies, calendar and diary entries, graphs, notes, charts, tabulations, data analysis, statistical or information accumulations, records of meetings and conversations, film impressions, magnetic tapes, and sound or mechanical reproductions; the term  means any civil proceeding before a court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or other body conducting a legal or administrative proceeding in which the Commission is not a named party.

        (2) Prior to or simultaneously with a demand to a Commission employee for the production of documents or for testimony concerning matters relating to official duties, the party seeking such production or testimony must serve upon the General Counsel of the Commission an affidavit, or if that is not feasible, then a statement which sets forth the title of the case, the forum, the party's interest in the case, the reasons for the request, and a showing that the desired testimony or documents are not reasonably available from any other source. Where testimony is sought, the party must also provide a summary of the testimony desired, the intended use of the testimony, and show that Commission records could not be provided and used instead of the requested testimony. A subpoena for testimony from a Commission employee concerning official matters or for the production of documents shall be served in accordance with Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and a copy of the subpoena shall be sent to the General Counsel.

        (3) Any employee or former employee who is served with a subpoena or other demand shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the service of the subpoena or other demand, the nature of the documents or information sought, and all relevant facts and circumstances.

        (4) Absent written authorization from the Chairman of the Commission (“Chairman”), the employee shall respectfully decline to produce the requested documents, to testify, or to otherwise disclose requested information. If a court rules that the demand must be complied with despite the absence of such written authorization, the employee upon whom the demand is made shall respectfully refuse to comply based upon these regulations and  v.  340 U.S. 462 (1951).

        (5) The Chairman will consider and act upon subpoenas under this section with due regard for statutory restrictions, the Commission's rules and the public interest, taking into account such factors as the need to conserve employees' time for conducting official business, the need to prevent the expenditure of the United States government's time and money for private purposes, the need to maintain impartiality between private litigants in cases where no substantial governmental interest is involved, and the relevant legal standards for determining whether justification exists for the disclosure of nonpublic information and documents. If the Chairman determines that the subpoenaed documents or information are protected by a privilege or that the Commission has a duty in law or equity to protect such documents or information from disclosure, the General Counsel shall move the court to quash the subpoena or for other appropriate action.

        (6) The General Counsel may consult or negotiate with counsel or the party seeking testimony or documents to refine and limit the demand so that compliance is less burdensome, or obtain information necessary to make the determination described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Failure of the counsel or party seeking the testimony or documents to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed recommendation to the Chairman under paragraph (c)(5) of this section may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the demand.

        (7) Permission to testify will, in all cases, be limited to the information set forth in the affidavit as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or to such portions thereof as the Chairman deems proper.

        (8) If the Chairman authorizes the testimony of an employee, then the General Counsel shall arrange for the taking of the testimony by methods that are least disruptive of the official duties of the employee. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law. Costs of providing testimony, including transcripts, will be borne by the party requesting the testimony. Such costs shall also include reimbursing the Commission for the usual and ordinary expenses attendant upon the employee's absence from his or her official duties in connection with the case or matter, including the employee's salary and applicable overhead charges and any necessary travel expenses.

        (9) The Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel is further authorized to charge reasonable fees to parties demanding documents or information. Such fees, calculated to reimburse the government for the expense of responding to such demand, may include the costs of time expended by Commission employees to process and respond to the demand, attorney time for reviewing the demand and for related legal work in connection with the demand, and expenses generated by equipment used to search for, produce and copy the responsive information. In general, such fees will be assessed at the rates and in the manner specified in § 201.20 of this part.

        (10) This section does not affect the rights and procedures governing the public access to official documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act or the Privacy Act.

        (11) This section is intended to provide instructions to Commission employees and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the Commission.

        § 201.24   Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a records system.

#### § § 201.24

        (a) A request by an individual to gain access to his or her record(s) or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Commission shall be addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall indicate clearly both on the envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act request.

        (b) In order to facilitate location of requested records, whenever possible, the request of the individual shall name the system(s) of records maintained by the Commission which he or she believes contain records pertaining to him or her, shall reasonably describe the requested records, and identify the time period in which the records were compiled.

        (c) The Privacy Act Officer shall acknowledge receipt of a request within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), and wherever practicable, indicate whether or not access can be granted. If access is not to be granted, the requestor shall be notified of the reason in writing.

        (d) The Privacy Act Officer, or, the Inspector General, if such records are maintained by the Inspector General, shall ascertain whether the systems of records maintained by the Commission contain records pertaining to the individual, and whether access will be granted. Thereupon the Privacy Act Officer shall:

        (1) Notify the individual whether or not the requested record is contained in any system of records maintained by the Commission; and

        (2) Notify the individual of the procedures as prescribed in Secs. 201.25 and 201.26 of this part by which the individual may gain access to those records maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her. Access to the records will be provided within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

        § 201.25   Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

#### § § 201.25

        (a) If an individual wishes to examine his or her records in person, it shall be the responsibility of the individual requester to arrange an appointment with the Privacy Act Officer for the purpose of inspecting individual records. The time of inspection shall be during the regular office hours of the Commission, 8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., Monday through Friday. The time arranged should be mutually convenient to the requester and to the Commission.

        (b) The place where an individual may gain access to records maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her shall be at the United States International Trade Commission Building, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. The Privacy Act Officer shall inform the individual requester of the specific room wherein inspection will take place.

        (c) An individual may also request the Privacy Act Officer to provide the individual with a copy of his or her records by certified mail.

        (d) An individual who requests to gain access to those records maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her shall not be granted access to those records without first presenting adequate identification to the Privacy Act Officer. Adequate identification may include, but is not limited to, a government identification card, a driver's license, Medicare card, a birth certificate, or a passport. If requesting records by mail, an individual must provide full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The request must be signed and either notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, which permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, a requestor may also, at his or her option, include the individual's social security number.

        § 201.26   Disclosure of requested information to individuals.

#### § § 201.26

        (a) Once the Privacy Act Officer has made a determination to grant a request for access to individual records, in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform the requesting individual in writing and permit the individual to review the pertinent records and to have a copy made of all or any portion of them. Where redactions due to exemptions pursuant to § 201.32 would render such records or portions thereof incomprehensible, the Privacy Act Officer shall furnish an abstract in addition to an actual copy.

        (b) An individual has the right to have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him or her to review his or her records. The Privacy Act Officer shall permit a person of the individual requester's choosing to accompany the individual during inspection.

        (c) When the individual requests the Privacy Act Officer to permit a person of the individual's choosing to accompany him or her during the inspection of his or her records, the Privacy Act Officer shall require the individual requester to furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of the records in the accompanying person's presence.

        (d) The Privacy Act Officer shall take all necessary steps to insure that individual privacy is protected while the individual requester is inspecting his or her records or while those records are being discussed. Only the Privacy Act Officer shall accompany the individual as representative of the Commission during the inspection of the individual's records. The Privacy Act Officer shall be authorized to discuss the pertinent records with the individual.

        § 201.27   Special procedures: Medical records.

#### § § 201.27

        (a) While an individual has an unqualified right of access to the records in systems of records maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her, medical and psychological records merit special treatment because of the possibility that disclosure will have an adverse physical or psychological effect upon the requesting individual. Accordingly, in those instances where an individual is requesting the medical and/or psychological records which pertain to him or her, he or she shall, in his or her Privacy Act request to the Privacy Act Officer as called for in § 201.24(a) of this part, specify a physician to whom the medical and/or psychological records may be released.

        (b) It shall be the responsibility of the individual requesting medical or psychological records to specify a physician to whom the requested records may be released. If an individual refuses to name a physician and insists on inspecting his or her medical or psychological records in the absence of a doctor's discussion and advice, the individual shall so state in his or her Privacy Act request to the Privacy Act Officer as called for in § 201.24(a) of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall provide access to or transmit such records directly to the individual.

        § 201.28   Requests for correction or amendment of records.

#### § § 201.28

        (a) If, upon viewing his or her records, an individual disagrees with a portion thereof or feels sections thereof to be erroneous, the individual may request amendment[s] of the records pertaining to him or her. The individual should request such an amendment in writing and should identify each particular record in question, the system[s] of records wherein the records are located, specify the amendment requested, and specify the reasons why the records are not correct, relevant timely or complete. The individual may submit any documentation that would be helpful. The request for amendment of records shall be addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall clearly indicate both on the envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act request for amendment of records.

        (b) Not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of a Privacy Act request for amendment of records, the Privacy Act Officer shall acknowledge such receipt in writing. Such a request for amendment will be granted or denied by the Privacy Act Officer or, for records maintained by the Inspector General. If the request is granted, the Privacy Act Officer, or the Inspector General for records maintained by the Inspector General, shall promptly make any correction of any portion of the record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. If, however, the request is denied, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform the individual of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the individual's request and give the reason(s) for the refusal. In cases where the Privacy Act Officer or the Inspector General has refused to amend in accordance with an individual's request, he or she also shall advise the individual of the procedures under § 201.30 of this part for the individual to request a review of that refusal by the full Commission or by an officer designated by the Commission.

        § 201.29   Commission disclosure of individual records, accounting of record disclosures, and requests for accounting of record disclosures.

#### § § 201.29

        (a) It is the policy of the Commission not to disclose, except as permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), any record which is contained in any system of records maintained by the Commission to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains.

        (b) Except for disclosures either to officers and employees of the Commission, or to contractor employees who, in the Inspector General's or the Privacy Act Officer's judgment, as appropriate, are acting as federal employees, who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties, and any disclosure required by 5 U.S.C. 552, the Privacy Act Officer shall keep an accurate accounting of:

        (1) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to another agency under paragraph (a) of this section; and

        (2) The name or address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made.

        (c) The Privacy Act Officer shall retain the accounting required by paragraph (b) of this section for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after such disclosure.

        (d) Except for disclosures made to other agencies for civil or criminal law enforcement purposes pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7), the Privacy Act Officer shall make any accounting made under paragraph (b) of this section available to the individual named in the record at the individual's request.

        (e) An individual requesting an accounting of disclosure of his or her records should make the request in writing to the Privacy Act Officer, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. The request should identify each particular record in question and, whenever possible, the system[s] of records wherein the requested records are located, and clearly indicate both on the envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act request for an accounting of disclosure of records.

        (f) Where the Commission has provided any person or other agency with an individual record and such accounting as required by paragraph (b) of this section has been made, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform all such persons or other agencies of any correction, amendment, or notation of dispute concerning said record.

#### § § 201.30

        (a) The individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Privacy Act Officer or the Inspector General for access to a record, to amend a record, or to obtain an accounting of any record disclosure, may request a review of such refusal by the Commission within 60 days of receipt of the denial of his or her request. A request for review of such a refusal should be addressed to the Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall clearly indicate both on the envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act review request.

        (b) Not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date on which the Commission receives a request for review of the Privacy Act Officer's or the Inspector General's refusal to grant access to a record, to amend a record, or to provide an accounting of a record disclosure, the Commission shall complete such a review and make a final determination thereof unless, for good cause shown, the Commission extends the 30-day period.

        (c) After the individual's request has been reviewed by the Commission, if the Commission agrees with the Privacy Act Officer's or the Inspector General's refusal to grant access to a record, to amend a record, or to provide an accounting of a record disclosure, in accordance with the individual's request, the Commission shall:

        (1) Notify the individual in writing of the Commission's decision;

        (2) For requests to amend or correct records, advise the individual that he or she has the right to file a concise statement of disagreement with the Commission which sets forth his or her reasons for disagreement with the refusal of the Commission to grant the individual's request; and

        (3) Notify the individual of his or her legal right, if any, to judicial review of the Commission's final determination.

        (d) In any disclosure, containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement regarding an amendment of an individual's record, the Privacy Act Officer, or, for records maintained by the Inspector General, the Inspector General, shall clearly note any portion of the record which is disputed and shall provide copies of the statement and, if the Commission deems it appropriate, copies of a concise statement of the reasons of the Commission for not making the amendments requested, to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.

        § 201.31   Fees and employee conduct.

#### § § 201.31

        (a) The Commission shall not charge any fee for the cost of searching for and reviewing an individual's records.

        (b) Reproduction, duplication or copying of records by the Commission shall be at the rate of $0.10 per page. There shall be no charge, however, when the total amount does not exceed $25.00.

        (c) The Privacy Act Officer shall establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record, and periodically instruct each such person with respect to such rules and the requirements of the Privacy Act including the penalties for noncompliance.

        § 201.32   Specific exemptions.

#### § § 201.32

        (a) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (5) and (6), records contained in the system entitled “Personnel Security Investigative Files” have been exempted from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I) and (f) of the Privacy Act. Pursuant to section 552a(k)(1) of the Privacy Act, the Commission exempts records that contain properly classified information that pertains to national defense or foreign policy and is obtained from other systems of records or another Federal agency. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d). All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is also exempted because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts or access to classified information. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor such a promise should an individual request access to the accounting of disclosure, or access to or amendment of the record, that would reveal the identity of a confidential source. All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is also exempt because portions of a case file record may relate to testing and examining material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.

        (b) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (k)(2), records contained in the system entitled “Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Records” have been exempted from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I) and (f) of the Privacy Act. Pursuant to section 552a(k)(1) of the Privacy Act, the Commission exempts records that contain properly classified information pertaining to national defense or foreign policy. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude individuals' access to or amendment of such classified information under the Privacy Act. Pursuant to section 552a(k)(2) of the Privacy Act, and in order to protect the effectiveness of Inspector General investigations by preventing individuals who may be the subject of an investigation from obtaining access to the records and thus obtaining the opportunity to conceal or destroy evidence or to intimidate witnesses, the Commission exempts records insofar as they include investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. However, if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which he is otherwise entitled under Federal law due to the maintenance of this material, such material shall be provided to such individual except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

        § 201.33   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 201.33

        (a) Consistent with the principle that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government, it is the purpose of this subpart to open the meetings of the United States International Trade Commission to public observation while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Commission to carry out its statutory functions and responsibilities. These regulations are promulgated pursuant to the directive of section (g) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b(g)), and specifically implement sections (b) through (f) of said act (5 U.S.C. 552(b) through (f)).

        (b) Public access to documents being considered at Commission meetings may be obtained by access to the public files of the Commission or, where documents are not in said public files, shall be obtained in the manner set forth in subpart C of this part (§§ 201.17 through 201.21).

        (c) Unless otherwise provided by the public notices as described in § 201.35 of this subpart, public observation of Commission meetings does not encompass public participation in the deliberations at such meetings.

        (a)(1) Except as hereinafter provided, the term  means the deliberations of at least the number of individual Commissioners required to take action on behalf of the Commission where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Commission business.

        (2) The consideration by individual Commissioners of business which is circulated sequentially in writing (circulation by “action jacket”) is not considered a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because circulation by action jacket does not determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of Commission business until ratification thereof by formal vote of the Commissioners in a meeting as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, although action proposed by action jacket may be taken before or after formal ratification thereof by vote at a Commission meeting.

        (3) Conference telephone calls among the Commissioners are considered meetings as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section if they involve the number of Commissioners requisite for Commission action, and where the deliberations of the Commissioners determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Commission business.

        (4) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the  purpose of determining whether or not to call a meeting at a date earlier than the requisite public notice period as specified in § 201.35 of this subpart are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (5) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the  purpose of determining whether or not to close a portion or portions of a meeting or series of meetings pursuant to § 201.36 of this subpart are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (6) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the  purpose of determining whether or not to change the subject matter of a publicly announced meeting, or to change the determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, to the public, following a public notice, as permitted under § 201.37(b) of this subpart, are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (b) The terms  and  mean the _Secretary_ and _General Counsel_ of the Commission and their respective designees within their respective offices.

When a vote to close a portion or portions of a meeting in accordance with § 201.36 of this subpart or a vote to change the subject matter of a meeting or to change a determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, to the public in accordance with § 201.37(b) of this subpart fails for lack of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission, the vote shall also be published as part of the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)(1) The 7-day period for public notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply when a majority of the entire membership of the Commission determines by recorded vote that Commission business requires that a particular meeting be called with less than 7 days' notice and that no earlier announcement of such meeting was possible.

        (3) When the Commission not only has voted in conformity with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to shorten the 7-day period for public notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a particular meeting, but also has voted to close a portion or portions of such meeting in accordance with § 201.36 of this subpart, the public notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall also include, or be amended to include, if already issued, those items specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d)(1) When the Commission has changed the time or place of a publicly announced meeting by acting under § 201.37(a) of this subpart, the public notice required by paragraph (a) or (c)(2) of this section shall be amended to reflect such changed time or place.

        (2) When the Commission has changed the subject matter of a meeting or its determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, to the public following a public notice by acting under § 201.37(b) of this subpart, the public notice required by paragraph (a) or (c)(2) of this section shall be amended to

        (i) Include a statement affirming that Commission business required the change in subject matter and that no earlier announcement of such change was possible and

        (ii) Indicate the change in subject matter and the vote of each Commissioner upon such change.

        (e)(1) The Secretary shall issue the public notices required by this section and such amendments thereto as are appropriate to the specific meeting to which they pertain.

        (2) The Secretary

        (i) Shall promptly post the public notices referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section on bulletin boards outside the Office of the Secretary to the Commission,

#### § § 201.36

        (a) Every meeting of the Commission shall be open to public observation except when the Commission properly determines in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section that a portion or portions of a Commission meeting shall be closed to the public for the specific reasons enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) The Commission may close a portion or portions of a Commission meeting only when it determines that public disclosure of information to be discussed at such meeting is likely to:

        (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;

        (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act), provided that such statute (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.

        (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes, or information which, if written, would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would: (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or to an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source, and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law-enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national-security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;

        (8)(i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would, in those instances where the Commission regulates commodities, be likely to lead to significant financial speculation in such commodities;

No proxy votes are permissible.

        (2) A series of meetings may be closed pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section so long as each meeting in such series: (i) Involves the same particular matters and (ii) is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series.

        (f) When the Commission (i) Has voted to close a portion or portions of a meeting in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section or (ii) has voted to close a portion or portions of a series of meetings in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the public notices referred to in paragraph (a) or (c)(2) of § 201.35 shall be issued or amended in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c)(3) of § 201.35 at the earliest practicable time, but no later than one (1) working day following such vote.

**Authority:** Authority: 19 U.S.C. 1335; E.O. 13526, 75 FR 707.

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 46350, Aug. 8, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 201.42   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 201.42

        This subpart supplements Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, and its implementing directive (32 CFR part 2001) as it applies to the Commission.

        § 201.43   Mandatory declassification review.

#### § § 201.43

        (a) —(1)  Mandatory declassification review (“MDR”) means the review for declassification of classified information in response to a request for declassification that meets the requirements under section 3.5 of Executive Order 13526.

        (2)  Requests for MDR of information in the custody of the Commission that is classified under Executive Order 13526 or predecessor orders shall be directed to the Secretary to the Commission, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. MDR requests will be processed in accordance with Executive Order 13526, its implementing directive, and this section. An MDR request must describe the document or material containing the requested information with sufficient specificity to enable Commission personnel to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Requests for broad types of information, entire file series of records, or similar non-specific requests may be denied processing. The Secretary shall notify a requester who has submitted a non-specific request that no further action will be taken on the request unless the requester provides additional description.

        (b)  (1) Requests for records submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended, or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, which include classified information shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of those acts and applicable Commission regulations (subpart C of this part (FOIA regulations); subpart D of this part (Privacy Act regulations)).

        (2) If a requester submits a request under FOIA and also requests MDR, the Secretary shall require the requester to select one process or the other. If the requester fails to select one or the other process, the Secretary will treat the request as a FOIA request unless the requested materials are subject only to MDR.

        (c)  (1) Because the Commission does not have original classification authority and all U.S. originated classified information in its custody has been originally classified by another Federal agency, the Secretary shall refer all requests for MDR and the pertinent records to the originating agency for review. Following consultations with the originating agency, the Secretary shall notify the requester of the referral unless such association is itself classified under Executive Order 13526 or its predecessor orders. The Secretary shall request that the originating agency, in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33(a)(2)(ii) and 2001.34(e):

        (i) Promptly process the request for declassification,

        (ii) Communicate its declassification determination to the Secretary, and

        (iii) If the originating agency proposes to withhold any information from public release, notify the Secretary of the specific information at issue and the applicable law that authorizes and warrants withholding such information.

        (2) Unless a prior arrangement has been made with the originating agency, the Secretary shall collect the results of that agency's review and inform the requester of any final decision regarding the declassification of the requested information as follows:

        (i) If the originating agency denies declassification of the requested information in whole or in part, the Secretary shall ensure that the decision provided to the requester includes notification of the right to file an administrative appeal with the originating agency within 60 days of receipt of the denial and the mailing address for the appellate authority at the originating agency.

        (ii) If the originating agency declassifies the requested information in whole or in part, the Secretary shall determine whether the requested declassified information is exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part, under the provisions of a statutory authority, such as the FOIA. The Secretary shall inform the requester that an appeal from a denial of requested declassified information must be received within 60 days of the date of the letter of denial and shall be made to the Commission and addressed to the Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436.

        (d) —(1)  “Foreign government information” (“FGI”) means information provided to the United States Government by a foreign government or governments, an international organization of governments, or any element thereof, with the expectation that the information, the source of the information, or both, are to be held in confidence; information produced by the United States Government pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangement with a foreign government or governments, or an international organization of governments, or any element thereof, requiring that the information, the arrangement, or both, are to be held in confidence; or information received and treated as FGI under the terms of a predecessor of Executive Order 13526.

        (2)  The Commission will handle such MDR requests consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 13526 and 32 CFR part 2001. MDR requests for FGI initially received or classified by another Federal agency shall be referred to such agency following the referral procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (e)  MDR appeals are for the denial of classified information only. Appeals of denials are handled in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33(a)(2)(iii), which provides that the agency appellate authority deciding an administrative appeal of the denial of an MDR request shall notify the requester in writing of the reasons for any denial and inform the requester of his or her final appeal rights to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.

        (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

        (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 201.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens.

        (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

        (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written).

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

        (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.

        § 201.202   Purpose and scope of salary and administrative offset rules.

#### § § 201.202

        (a)  The purpose of sections 201.201 through 201.207 is to implement 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716, and 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorize the collection by salary offset, administrative offset, or tax refund offset of debts owed by persons, organizations, or entities to the Federal government. Generally, however, a debt may not be collected by such means if it has been outstanding for more than ten years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued. These proposed regulations are consistent with the Office of Personnel Management regulations on salary offset, codified at 5 CFR Part 550, subpart K, and with regulations on administrative offset codified at 31 CFR part 901.

        (b)  (1) Sections 201.201 through 201.207 establish agency procedures for the collection of certain debts owed the Government.

        (2) Sections 201.201 through 201.207 apply to collections by the Commission from:

        (i) Federal employees who are indebted to the Commission;

        (ii) Employees of the Commission who are indebted to other agencies; and

        (iii) Other persons, organizations, or entities that are indebted to the Commission.

        (3) Sections 201.201 through 201.207 do not apply:

        (i) To debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), or the tariff laws of the United States;

        (ii) To a situation to which the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601 ) applies; or

        (iii) In any case where collection of a debt is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 4108).

        (4) Nothing in Sections 201.201 through 201.207 precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711 ), namely, 31 CFR chapter IX.

        § 201.203   Delegation of authority.

#### § § 201.203

        (a) Initiate and effectuate the administrative collection process;

        (b) Accept or reject compromise offers and suspend or terminate collection actions where the claim does not exceed $100,000 or such higher amount as the Chairman may from time to time prescribe, exclusive of interest, administrative costs, and penalties as provided herein, as set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2);

        (c) Report to consumer reporting agencies certain data pertaining to delinquent debts;

        (d) Use offset procedures to effectuate collection; and

        (e) Take any other action necessary to facilitate and augment collection in accordance with the policies contained herein and as otherwise provided by law.

        § 201.204   Salary offset.

#### § § 201.204

        (a)  Deductions under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be made unless the Commission provides the employee with a written Notice of Intent to Offset a minimum of 30 calendar days before salary offset is initiated. The Notice of Intent shall state:

        (1) That the Director has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed;

        (2) The Director's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full;

        (3) The amount of the debt and the facts giving rise to the debt;

        (4) A repayment schedule that includes the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;

        (5) The opportunity for the employee to propose an alternative written schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt, in lieu of offset, on terms acceptable to the Commission. The employee shall include a justification in the request for the alternative schedule. The schedule shall be agreed to and signed by both the employee and the Director;

        (6) An explanation of the Commission's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards;

        (7) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records of the Commission not exempt from disclosure pertaining to the debt claimed or to receive copies of such records if the debtor is unable personally to inspect the records, due to geographical or other constraints;

        (8) The name, address, and telephone number of the Director to whom requests for access to records relating to the debt must be sent;

        (9) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an impartial hearing official (an administrative law judge or other hearing official not under the supervision or control of the Chairman) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed or the repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period), so long as a request is filed by the employee as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

        (10) The name, address, and telephone number of the Director to whom a proposal for voluntary repayment must be sent and who may be contacted concerning procedures for requesting a hearing;

        (11) The method and deadline for requesting a hearing;

        (12) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following receipt of the Notice of Intent will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

        (13) The name and address of the office to which the request should be sent;

        (14) That the Commission will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset not less than 30 days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Intent to Offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;

        (15) That a final decision on whether a hearing will be held (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date;

        (16) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

        (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

        (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, or under any other applicable statutory authority; or

        (iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or under any other applicable statutory authority;

        (17) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made;

        (18) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted from debts that are later waived or found not to be owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and

        (19) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.

        (b)  (1) An employee who desires to inspect or copy Commission records related to a debt owed to the Commission must send a letter to the Director as designated in the Notice of Intent requesting access to the relevant records. The letter must be received in the office of the Director within 15 calendar days after the employee's receipt of the Notice of Intent.

        (2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the Director will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.

        (3) If the employee is unable personally to inspect the records, due to geographical or other constraints, the Director shall arrange to send copies of such records to the employee.

        (c) —(1)  (i) An employee who requests a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt held by the Commission or on the offset schedule proposed by the Commission must send such request to the Director. The request for a hearing must be received by the Director on or before the 15th calendar day following receipt by the employee of the notice.

        (ii) The employee must specify whether an oral hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. The request must be signed by the employee and must fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position.

        (2)  If the employee files a request for hearing after the expiration of the 15-calendar-day period provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Director may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control or that he or she failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.

        (3)  (i) When the debtor is not a Commission employee and the Commission cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or other hearing official, the Commission may request a hearing official from an agent of the paying agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the paying agency.

        (ii) When the debtor is a Commission employee, the Commission may contact any agent of another agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the agency, to request a hearing official.

        (4) —(i)  After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing, which must occur no more than 30 calendar days after the request is received, unless the employee requests that the hearing be delayed. If the hearing will be conducted by examination of documents, the employee shall be notified within 30 calendar days that he or she should submit evidence and arguments in writing to the hearing official.

        (ii)  An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing need not be an adversarial adjudication, and rules of evidence need not apply. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings shall do so under oath or affirmation. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:

        (A) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the employee and agency representative are given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument;

        (B) Informal meetings in which the hearing examiner interviews the employee; or

        (C) Formal written submissions followed by an opportunity for oral presentation.

        (iii)  If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she shall make the determination based upon a review of the written record.

        (iv)  The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing conducted under this section.

        (5)  The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon all evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the request was received by the Commission, unless the hearing was delayed at the request of the employee, in which case the 60 day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. The decision of the hearing official shall be final.

        (6)  The written decision shall include:

        (i) A summary of the facts concerning the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

        (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and

        (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.

        (7)  If, in the absence of good cause shown (e.g., illness), the employee or the representative of the Commission fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentation submitted by both parties. At the request of both parties, the hearing official may schedule a new hearing date. Both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of this new hearing.

        (d)  (1) The Director shall issue a certification in all cases where:

        (i) The hearing official determines that a debt exists; or

        (ii) The employee admits the existence and amount of the debt, for example, by failing to request a hearing.

        (2) The certification must be in writing and must state:

        (i) That the employee owes the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued;

        (iv) That the Commission's regulations have been approved by OPM pursuant to 5 CFR part 550, subpart K;

        (v) If the collection is to be made by lump-sum payment, the amount and date such payment will be collected;

        (vi) If the collection is to be made in installments, the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially established pay period; and

        (vii) The date the employee was notified of the debt, the action(s) taken pursuant to the Commission's regulations, and the dates such actions were taken.

        (e)  (1) In response to a Notice of Intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt in accordance with scheduled installment payments. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall set forth a proposed repayment schedule. Any proposal under paragraph (e) of this section must be received by the Director within 15 calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Intent.

        (2) In response to a timely proposal by the debtor, the Director shall notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the discretion of the Director to accept, reject, or propose to the debtor a modification of the proposed repayment agreement.

        (3) If the Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee shall have 15 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision in which to file a request for a hearing.

        (4) If the Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable or the debtor agrees to a modification proposed by the Director, the agreement shall be put in writing and signed by both the employee and the Director.

        (f)  (1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Director of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.

        (2) In determining whether, as a result of materially changed circumstances, an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit to the Director a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:

        (i) Income from all sources;

        (ii) Assets;

        (iii) Liabilities;

        (iv) Number of dependents;

        (v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;

        (vi) Medical expenses; and

        (vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.

        (3) If the employee requests a special review under paragraph (f) of this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in extreme financial hardship to the employee.

        (4) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Director shall notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of such determination, including, if appropriate, his or her acceptance of a revised offset or payment schedule.

        (5) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Director shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.

        (g)  (1) Upon issuance of a proper certification by the Director (for debts owed to the Commission) or upon receipt of a proper certification from another creditor agency, the Office of Finance shall send the employee a written notice of salary offset. Such notice shall advise the employee:

        (i) Of the certification that has been issued by the Director or received from another creditor agency;

        (ii) Of the amount of the debt and of the deductions to be made; and

        (iii) Of the initiation of salary offset at the next officially established pay interval or as otherwise provided for in the certification.

        (2) The Office of Finance shall provide a copy of the notice to the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.

        (h) —(1)  (i) The Director shall coordinate salary deductions under this section.

        (ii) The Director shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount of the salary offset subject to the requirements in this paragraph.

        (iii) Deductions shall begin the pay period following the issuance of the certification by the Director or the receipt by the Office of Finance of the certification from another agency or as soon thereafter as possible.

        (2) —(i)  If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt ordinarily will be collected in one lump-sum payment.

        (ii)  Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment should normally be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments of less than $50 should be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

        (iii)  In order to liquidate a debt, a lump-sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay may be made pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) from any final salary payment due a former employee, whether the former employee was separated voluntarily or involuntarily.

        (iv)  Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Commission, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Commission, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, may offset any later payments of any kind to the former employee to collect the balance of the debt.

        (3)  Where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Office of Finance may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.

        (4)  (i) For Commission employees, subject to paragraph (h)(3) of this section and (paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, offsets to recover debts owed the United States Government shall be made from disposable pay in the following order of precedence:

        (A) Indebtedness due the Commission;

        (B) Indebtedness due other agencies.

        (ii) In the event that a debt to the Commission is certified while an employee is subject to salary offset to repay another agency, the Office of Finance may, at its discretion, determine whether the debt to the Commission should be repaid before the debt to the other agency, repaid simultaneously, or repaid after the debt to the other agency.

        (iii) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over other deductions under this section, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).

        (i) —(1)  (i) The Director shall be responsible for:

        (A) Arranging for a hearing upon proper request by a Federal employee;

        (B) Preparing the Notice of Intent to Offset consistent with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;

        (C) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

        (D) Ensuring that each certification of debt is sent to a paying agency pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (ii) Upon completion of the procedures established in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, the Director shall submit a certified debt claim and an installment agreement or other instruction on the payment schedule, if applicable, to the employee's paying agency.

        (iii) If the employee is in the process of separating from Government employment, the Commission shall submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection by lump-sum deduction from the employee's final check. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its collection and furnish a copy of the certification to the Commission and to the employee.

        (iv) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Commission may, unless otherwise prohibited, request that money due and payable to the employee from the Federal Government be administratively offset to collect the debt.

        (v) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Commission shall not repeat the procedures described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section in order to resume collecting the debt. Instead, the Commission shall review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer and shall ensure that collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

        (2) —(i)  When the Commission receives a certified claim from a creditor agency, the employee shall be given written notice of the certification, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the periodic deductions. Deductions shall be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval or as otherwise provided for in the certification.

        (ii)  When the Commission receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Commission shall return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed and that a properly certified debt claim must be received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.

        (iii)  The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.

        (iv)  If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Commission, the employee transfers to an agency outside the Commission before the debt is collected in full, the Commission must certify the total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification shall be furnished to the employee and one copy shall be sent to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer. If the Commission is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the requirements set forth herein and in the Office of Personnel Management's regulation (5 CFR part 550) have been fully met.

        (j) Interest, Penalties, and Administrative Costs. Where the Commission is the creditor agency, it shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9.

        (k)  (1) Where the Commission is the creditor agency, it shall promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 when:

        (i) The debt is compromised or otherwise found not to be owing to the United States; or

        (ii) An administrative or judicial order directs the Commission to make a refund.

        (2) Unless required by law or contract, refunds under this paragraph (k) shall not bear interest.

        (l)  (1) The Commission may provide a hearing official upon request of the creditor agency when the debtor is employed by the Commission and the creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement.

        (2) The Commission may provide a hearing official upon request of a creditor agency when the debtor works for the creditor agency and that agency cannot arrange for a hearing official.

        (3) The Director shall arrange for qualified personnel to serve as hearing officials.

        § 201.205   Salary adjustments.

#### § § 201.205

        Any negative adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage, or a change in coverage, under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay shall not be considered collection of a “debt” for the purposes of this section if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. In such cases, the Commission need not comply with § 201.204, but it will provide a clear and concise statement in the employee's earnings statement advising the employee of the previous overpayment at the time the adjustment is made.

        § 201.206   Administrative offset.

#### § § 201.206

        (a)  The Director may collect a claim pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from a person, organization, or entity other than an agency of the United States Government by administrative offset of monies payable by the Government. Collection by administrative offset shall be undertaken where the claim is certain in amount, where offset is feasible and desirable and not otherwise prohibited, where the applicable statute of limitations has not expired, and where the offset is in the best interest of the United States.

        (b)  Prior to the completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission may effect offset if:

        (1) Failure to offset would substantially prejudice the Commission's ability to collect the debt; and

        (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section. Such prior offsetting shall be followed promptly by the completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  (1) Unless the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section are used, prior to collecting any claim by administrative offset or referring such claim to another agency for collection through administrative offset, the Director shall provide the debtor with the following:

        (i) Written notification of the nature and amount of the claim, the intention of the Director to collect the claim through administrative offset, and a statement of the rights of the debtor under this paragraph;

        (ii) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Commission not exempt from disclosure with respect to the claim;

        (iii) An opportunity to have the Commission's determination of indebtedness reviewed by the Director. Any request for review by the debtor shall be in writing and be submitted to the Commission within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice of the offset. The Director may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor. The Commission shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when:

        (A) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Commission to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or

        (B) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Commission determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Commission shall document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Commission shall nevertheless accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” (i.e., the Commission will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the written record); and

        (iv) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of the Commission.

        (2) If the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section are employed, the procedures described in this paragraph shall be effected after offset.

        (d)  Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9, the Commission shall assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States. The Commission is authorized to assess interest and related charges on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

        (e)  Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.

        (f)  The Director may request that a debt owed to the Commission be administratively offset against funds due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency. In requesting administrative offset, the Commission, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor:

        (1) That the debtor owes the debt;

        (2) The amount and basis of the debt; and

        (3) That the Commission has complied with the requirements of its own administrative offset regulations and the applicable provisions of 31 CFR part 901 with respect to providing the debtor with due process.

        (g)  Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the requested offset only upon:

        (1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency:

        (i) That the debtor owes the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and

        (iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 31 CFR part 901, including providing any required hearing or review.

        (2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.

        § 201.207   Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund

#### § § 201.207

        (a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Commission may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debt owed to the Commission by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.

        (b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall include a written certification that:

        (1) The debtor owes the Commission a debt, including the amount of the debt;

        (2) The Commission has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and

        (3) The Commission has complied with the requirements of 31 CFR 901.3, including any required hearing or review.

        (c) Once the Commission decides to request administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it shall make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor shall be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.

        (d) If the Commission collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 201.208   Tax refund offset.

#### § § 201.208

        (a)  The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) and 31 U.S.C. 3720A authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to offset a delinquent debt owed to the United States Government from the tax refund due a taxpayer when other collection efforts have failed to recover the amount due.

        (b) —(1)  Debt means money owed by an individual, organization or entity from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, leases, services, overpayments, civil and criminal penalties, damages, interest, fines, administrative costs, and all other similar sources. A debt becomes eligible for tax refund offset procedures if:

        (i) It cannot currently be collected pursuant to the salary offset procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);

        (ii) The debt is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot currently be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a); and

        (iii) The requirements of this section are otherwise satisfied.

        (2)  A dispute is a written statement supported by documentation or other evidence that all or part of an alleged debt is not past due or legally enforceable, that the amount is not the amount currently owed, that the outstanding debt has been satisfied, or, in the case of a debt reduced to judgment, that the judgment has been satisfied or stayed.

        (3)  Notice means the information sent to the debtor pursuant to § 201.208(d). The date of the notice is the date shown on the notice letter as its date of issuance.

        (4)  All judgment debts are past due for purposes of this section. Such debts remain past due until paid in full.

        (c) The Commission may refer any past due, legally enforceable non-judgment debt of an individual, organization or entity to Treasury for offset if the Commission's or the referring agency's rights of action accrued more than three months but less than ten years before the offset is made. Debts reduced to judgment may be referred at any time. Debts in amounts lower than $25.00 are not subject to referral.

        (d) The Commission will provide the debtor with written notice of its intent to offset before initiating the offset. Notice will be mailed to the debtor at the current address of the debtor, as determined from information obtained from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2), (4), (5) or from information regarding the debt maintained by the Commission. The notice sent to the debtor will state the amount of the debt and inform the debtor that:

        (1) The debt is past due;

        (2) The Commission intends to refer the debt to Treasury for offset from tax refunds that may be due to the taxpayer;

        (3) The Commission intends to provide information concerning the delinquent debt exceeding $100 to a consumer reporting bureau unless such debt has already been disclosed; and

        (4) The debtor has 65 calendar days from the date of notice in which to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due, that the amount is not the amount currently owed, that the outstanding debt has been satisfied, or, if a judgment debt, that the debt has been satisfied, or stayed, before the debt is reported to a consumer reporting agency, if applicable, and referred to Treasury for offset from tax refunds.

        (e) If the debtor neither pays the amount due nor presents evidence that the amount is not past due or is satisfied or stayed, the Commission will report the debt to a consumer reporting agency at the end of the notice period, if applicable, and refer the debt to Treasury for offset from the taxpayer's federal tax refund. The Commission shall certify to Treasury that reasonable efforts have been made by the Commission to obtain payment of such debt.

        (f) A debtor may request a review by the Commission if the debtor believes that all or part of the debt is not past due or is not legally enforceable, or, in the case of a judgment debt, that the debt has been stayed or the amount satisfied, as follows:

        (1) The debtor must send a written request for review to the Director at the address provided in the notice.

        (2) The request must state the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past due, is not legally enforceable, has been satisfied, or, if a judgment debt, has been satisfied or stayed.

        (3) The request must include any documents that the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information will be submitted within the time permitted.

        (4) If the debtor wishes to inspect records establishing the nature and amount of the debt, the debtor must make a written request to the Director for an opportunity for such an inspection. The office holding the relevant records not exempt from disclosure shall make them available for inspection during normal business hours within one week from the date of receipt of the request.

        (5) The request for review and any additional information submitted pursuant to the request must be received by the Director at the address stated in the notice within 65 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice.

        (6) The Commission will review disputes and shall consider its records and any documentation and arguments submitted by the debtor. The Commission's decision to refer to Treasury any disputed portion of the debt shall be made by the Chairman. The Commission shall send a written notice of its decision to the debtor. There is no administrative appeal of this decision.

        (7) If the evidence presented by the debtor is considered by a non-Commission agent or other entities or persons acting on the Commission's behalf, the debtor will be accorded at least 30 calendar days from the date the agent or other entity or person determines that all or part of the debt is past-due and legally enforceable to request review by an officer or employee of the Commission of any unresolved dispute.

        (8) Any debt that previously has been reviewed pursuant to this section or any other section of this subpart, or that has been reduced to a judgment, may not be disputed except on the grounds of payments made or events occurring subsequent to the previous review or judgment.

        (g) The Commission will notify Treasury of any change in the amount due promptly after receipt of payments or notice of other reductions.

        (h) In the event that more than one debt is owed, the tax refund offset procedure will be applied in the order in which the debts became past due.

        (b)  Any party submitting a document for the consideration of the Commission in the course of an investigation to which this part pertains shall, in addition to complying with § 201.8 of this chapter, serve a copy of the public version of such document on all other parties to the investigation in the manner prescribed in § 201.16 of this chapter, and, when appropriate, serve a copy of the confidential version of such document in the manner provided for in § 206.17(f). The Secretary shall promptly notify a petitioner when, before the establishment of a service list under § 206.17(a)(4), an application under § 206.17(a) is approved. When practicable, this notification shall be made by facsimile transmission. A copy of the petition including all confidential business information shall then be served by petitioner on those approved applicants in accordance with this section within two (2) calendar days of the time notification is made by the Secretary. If a document is filed before the Secretary's issuance of the service list provided for in § 201.11 of this chapter or the administrative protective order list provided for in § 206.17, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the document shall be served on all appropriate parties within two (2) days of the issuance of the service list or the administrative protective order list and a certificate of service shall then be filed. Notwithstanding § 201.16 of this chapter, petitions, briefs, and testimony filed by parties shall be served by hand or, if served by mail, by overnight mail or its equivalent.

The confidential version shall enclose all confidential business information in brackets and have the following warning marked on every page: “Bracketing of CBI not final for one business day after date of filing.” The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date of filing of the document,  at the same time as the nonconfidential version of the document is due to be filed. Until the bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the administrative protective order issued in the investigation. If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, the submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the confidential document at the same time as the nonconfidential version is filed. No changes to the document other than bracketing and deletion of confidential business information are permitted after the deadline. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the striking of all or a portion of a submitter's document.

        (d)  All briefs filed in proceedings subject to this part shall be filed electronically, and eight (8) true paper copies shall be filed on the same business day.

        (4) Such other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines to be appropriate, including public release of or striking from the record any information or briefs submitted by, or on behalf of, the offender or the party represented by the offender, denial of further access to confidential business information in the current or any future investigations before the Commission, and issuance of a public or private letter of reprimand; and

        (5) Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.

        (e)  (1) The Commission shall determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the later of

        (i) The date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care; or

        (ii) The completion of an investigation conducted under this subpart, the Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of an administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time during the pendency of the investigation, including all appeals, remands, and subsequent appeals. Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe a breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present his views on whether a breach has occurred. If subsequently the Commission determines that a breach has occurred and that further investigation is warranted, then the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person of that determination and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present his views on whether mitigating circumstances exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but no longer on whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his views, the Commission shall determine what sanction if any to impose.

        (2) Where the sanction imposed is a private letter of reprimand, the Secretary shall expunge the sanction from the recipient's record two (2) years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that

        (i) The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two year period, and

        (ii) The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at the end of the two year period. Upon the completion of such a pending breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.

        (f)  (1) Any party filing written submissions which include confidential business information to the Commission during an investigation shall at the same time serve complete copies of such submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and, except as provided in § 206.8(c), a nonconfidential version on all other parties. All such submissions must be accompanied by a certificate attesting that complete copies of the submission have been properly served. In the event that a submission is filed before the Secretary's list is established, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the submission shall be served within two (2) days of the establishment of the list and a certificate of service shall then be filed.

        (2) A party may seek an exemption from the service requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section for particular confidential business information by filing a request for exemption from disclosure in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. The Secretary shall promptly respond to the request. If a request is granted, the Secretary shall accept the information. The party shall file three versions of the submission containing the information in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and serve the submission in accordance with the requirements of § 206.8(b) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section, with the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure under administrative protective order has been granted redacted from the copies served. If a request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester.

        (3) The Secretary shall not accept for filing into the record of an investigation submissions filed without a proper certificate of service. Failure to comply with paragraph (f) of this section may result in denial of party status and such sanctions as the Commission deems appropriate. Confidential business information in submissions must be clearly marked as such when submitted, and must be segregated from other material being submitted.

        (g) —(1)  Any person may request exemption from the disclosure of confidential business information under administrative protective order, whether the person desires to include such information in a petition filed under this subpart B, or any other submission to the Commission during the course of an investigation. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary finds that such information is nondisclosable confidential business information. As defined in § 201.6(a)(2) of this chapter, nondisclosable confidential business information is privileged information, classified information, or specific information ( trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure.

        (2)  A request for exemption from disclosure must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor. At the same time as the request is filed, one copy of the confidential business information in question must be lodged with the Secretary solely for the purpose of obtaining a determination as to the request. The confidential business information for which exemption from disclosure is sought shall remain the property of the requester, and shall not become or be incorporated into any agency record until such time as the request is granted. A request should, when possible, be filed two business days prior to the deadline, if any, for filing the document in which the information for which exemption from disclosure is sought is proposed to be included. The Secretary shall promptly notify the requester as to whether the request has been approved or denied.

        (3)  If the request is approved, the person shall file three versions of the submission containing the nondisclosable confidential business information in question. One version shall contain all confidential business information, bracketed in accordance with § 201.6 of this chapter and § 206.8(c), with the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was granted enclosed in triple brackets. This version shall have the following warning marked on every page: “CBI exempted from disclosure under APO enclosed in triple brackets.” The other two versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 201.6 of this chapter and § 206.8(c), except that the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was granted shall be redacted from those versions of the submission.

        (4)  If the request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester.

If the Commission establishes a deadline for the filing of a document, and the submitter includes business proprietary information in the document, the submitter is to file and, if the submitter is a party, serve the business proprietary version of the document on the deadline and may file and serve the nonbusiness proprietary version of the document no later than one business day after the deadline for filing the document. The business proprietary version shall enclose all business proprietary information in brackets and have the following warning marked on every page: “Bracketing of BPI not final for one business day after date of filing.” The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date of filing of the document,  at the same time as the nonbusiness proprietary version of the document is due to be filed. Until the bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the administrative protective order issued in the investigation. If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, the submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the business proprietary document at the same time as the nonbusiness proprietary version is filed. No changes, including typographical changes, to the document other than bracketing and deletion of business proprietary information are permitted after the deadline unless an extension of time is granted to file an amended document pursuant to § 201.14(b)(2) of this chapter. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the striking from the record of all or a portion of a submitter's document.

#### § § 207.4

        (a)  The Secretary shall maintain the record of each investigation conducted by the Commission pursuant to title VII of the Act. The record shall be maintained contemporaneously with each actual filing in the record. It shall be divided into public and nonpublic sections. The Secretary shall also maintain a contemporaneous index of all materials filed in the record. All material properly filed with the Secretary shall be placed in the record. The Commission need not consider in its determinations or include in the record any material that is not filed with the Secretary. All material which is placed in the record shall be maintained in the public record, with the exception of material which is privileged, or which is business proprietary information submitted in accordance with § 201.6 of this chapter. Privileged and business proprietary material shall be maintained in the nonpublic record.

        (b)  The Commission may in its discretion verify information received in the course of an investigation. To the extent a verification results in new or different information, the Commission shall place such information on the record.

        (c)  Materials received by the Commission from the administering authority shall be placed on the Commission's record and shall be designated by the Commission as public or nonpublic in conformity with the applicable designation of the administering authority.

        § 207.6   [Reserved]

#### § § 207.6

        § 207.7   Limited disclosure of certain business proprietary information under administrative protective order.

#### § § 207.7

        (a)(1)  Upon receipt of a timely application filed by an authorized applicant, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, which describes in general terms the information requested, and sets forth the reasons for the request ( all business proprietary information properly disclosed pursuant to this section for the purpose of representing an interested party in investigations pending before the Commission), the Secretary shall make available all business proprietary information contained in Commission memoranda and reports and in written submissions filed with the Commission at any time during the investigation (except nondisclosable confidential business information) to the authorized applicant under an administrative protective order described in paragraph (b) of this section. The term “business proprietary information” has the same meaning as the term “confidential business information” as defined in § 201.6 of this chapter.

        (2)  An application under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be made by an authorized applicant on a form adopted by the Secretary or a photocopy thereof. A signed application shall be filed electronically. An application on behalf of a petitioner, a respondent, or another party must be made no later than the time that entries of appearance are due pursuant to § 201.11 of this chapter. In the event that two or more authorized applicants represent one interested party who is a party to the investigation, the authorized applicants must select one of their number to be lead authorized applicant. The lead authorized applicant's application must be filed no later than the time that entries of appearance are due. Provided that the application is accepted, the lead authorized applicant shall be served with business proprietary information pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. The other authorized applicants representing the same party may file their applications after the deadline for entries of appearance but at least five days before the deadline for filing posthearing briefs in the investigation, or the deadline for filing briefs in the preliminary phase of an investigation, or the deadline for filing submissions in a remanded investigation, and shall not be served with business proprietary information.

        (3)  (i) Only an authorized applicant may file an application under this subsection. An authorized applicant is:

        (A) An attorney for an interested party which is a party to the investigation;

        (B) A consultant or expert under the direction and control of a person under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section;

        (C) A consultant or expert who appears regularly before the Commission and who represents an interested party which is a party to the investigation; or

        (D) A representative of an interested party which is a party to the investigation, if such interested party is not represented by counsel.

        (ii) In addition, an authorized applicant must not be involved in competitive decisionmaking for an interested party which is a party to the investigation. Involvement in “competitive decisionmaking” includes past, present, or likely future activities, associations, and relationships with an interested party which is a party to the investigation that involve the prospective authorized applicant's advice or participation in any of such party's decisions made in light of similar or corresponding information about a competitor (pricing, product design, etc.).

        (4)  (i) The Secretary may adopt, from time to time, forms for submitting requests for disclosure pursuant to an administrative protective order incorporating the terms of this rule. The Secretary shall determine whether the requirements for release of information under this rule have been satisfied. This determination shall be made concerning specific business proprietary information as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than fourteen (14) days from the filing of the information, or seven (7) days in the preliminary phase of an investigation, except if the submitter of the information objects to its release or the information is unusually voluminous or complex, in which case the determination shall be made within thirty (30) days from the filing of the information, or ten (10) days in the preliminary phase of an investigation. The Secretary shall establish a list of parties whose applications have been granted. The Secretary's determination shall be final for purposes of review by the U.S. Court of International Trade under section 777(c)(2) of the Act.

        (ii) Should the Secretary determine pursuant to this section that materials sought to be protected from public disclosure by a person do not constitute business proprietary information or were not required to be served under paragraph (f) of this section, then the Secretary shall, upon request, issue an order on behalf of the Commission requiring the return of all copies of such materials served in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (iii) The Secretary shall release business proprietary information only to an authorized applicant whose application has been accepted and who presents the application along with adequate personal identification; or a person described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section who presents a copy of the statement referred to in that paragraph along with adequate personal identification.

        (iv) An authorized applicant granted access to business proprietary information in the preliminary phase of an investigation may, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, retain such business proprietary information during any final phase of that investigation, provided that the authorized applicant has not lost his authorized applicant status ( by terminating his representation of an interested party who is a party). When retaining business proprietary information pursuant to this paragraph, the authorized applicant need not file a new application in the final phase of the investigation.

        (b)  The administrative protective order under which information is made available to the authorized applicant shall require the applicant to submit to the Secretary a personal sworn statement that, in addition to such other conditions as the Secretary may require, the applicant shall:

        (1) Not divulge any of the business proprietary information obtained under the administrative protective order and not otherwise available to the applicant, to any person other than

        (i) Personnel of the Commission concerned with the investigation,

        (ii) The person or agency from whom the business proprietary information was obtained,

        (iii) A person whose application for access to business proprietary information under the administrative protective order has been granted by the Secretary, and

        (iv) Other persons, such as paralegals and clerical staff, who are employed or supervised by the authorized applicant; who have a need thereof in connection with the investigation; who are not involved in competitive decision making for an interested party which is a party to the investigation; and who have signed a statement in a form approved by the Secretary that they agree to be bound by the administrative protective order (the authorized applicant shall be responsible for retention and accuracy of such forms and shall be deemed responsible for such persons' compliance with the administrative protective order);

        (2) Use such business proprietary information solely for the purposes of representing an interested party in the Commission investigation then in progress or during judicial or other review of such Commission investigation;

        (3) Not consult with any person not described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section concerning such business proprietary information without first having received the written consent of the Secretary and the party or the attorney of the party from whom such business proprietary information was obtained;

        (4) Whenever materials ( documents, computer disks, etc.) containing such business proprietary information are not being used, store such material in a locked file cabinet, vault, safe, or other suitable container;

        (5) Serve all materials containing business proprietary information as directed by the Secretary and pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section;

        (6) Transmit all materials containing business proprietary information with a cover sheet identifying the materials as containing business proprietary information;

        (7) Comply with the provisions of this section;

        (8) Make true and accurate representations in the authorized applicant's application and promptly notify the Secretary of any changes that occur after the submission of the application and that affect the representations made in the application ( change in personnel assigned to the investigation);

        (9) Report promptly and confirm in writing to the Secretary any breach of the administrative protective order; and

        (10) Acknowledge that breach of the administrative protective order may subject the authorized applicant to such sanctions or other actions as the Commission deems appropriate.

        (c)  At such date as the Secretary may determine appropriate for particular data, each authorized applicant shall return or destroy all copies of materials released to authorized applicants pursuant to this section and all other materials containing business proprietary information, such as charts or notes based on any such information received under administrative protective order, and file with the Secretary a certificate attesting to his personal, good faith belief that all copies of such material have been returned or destroyed and no copies of such material have been made available to any person to whom disclosure was not specifically authorized.

        (d)  A breach of an administrative protective order may subject an offender to:

        (1) Disbarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission along with such person's partners, associates, employer, and employees, for up to seven years following publication of a determination that the order has been breached;

        (2) Referral to the United States Attorney;

        (3) In the case of an attorney, accountant, or other professional, referral to the ethics panel of the appropriate professional association;

        (4) Such other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines to be appropriate, including public release of or striking from the record any information or briefs submitted by, or on behalf of, the offender or the party represented by the offender, denial of further access to business proprietary information in the current or any future investigations before the Commission, and issuance of a public or private letter of reprimand; and

        (5) Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.

        (e)  (1) The Commission shall determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the later of the date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care, or the completion of an investigation conducted under subpart B or C of this part, the Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of an administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time during the pendency of the investigation, including all appeals, remands, and subsequent appeals. Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe a breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present his views on whether a breach has occurred. If subsequently the Commission determines that a breach has occurred and that further investigation is warranted, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person of that determination and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present his views on whether mitigating circumstances exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but no longer on whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his views, the Commission shall determine what sanction if any to impose.

        (2) Where the sanction imposed is a private letter of reprimand, the Secretary shall expunge the sanction from the recipient's record two (2) years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that

        (i) The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two year period, and

        (ii) The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at the end of the two year period. Upon the completion of such a pending breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.

        (f)  (1) Any party filing written submissions which include business proprietary information to the Commission during an investigation shall at the same time serve complete copies of such submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and, except as provided in § 207.3, a nonbusiness proprietary version on all other parties. All such submissions must be accompanied by a certificate attesting that complete copies of the submission have been properly served. In the event that a submission is filed before the Secretary's list is established, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the submission shall be served within two (2) days of the establishment of the list and a certificate of service shall then be filed.

        (2) If a party's request under paragraph (g) of this section is granted, the Secretary shall accept the nondisclosable confidential business information into the record. The party shall serve the submission containing such information in accordance with the requirements of § 207.3(b) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section, with the information redacted from the copies served.

        (3) The Secretary shall not accept for filing into the record of an investigation submissions filed without a proper certificate of service. Failure to comply with paragraph (f) of this section may result in denial of party status and such sanctions as the Commission deems appropriate. Business proprietary information in submissions must be dealt with as required by § 207.3(c).

        (g) —(1)  Any person may request exemption from the disclosure of business proprietary information under administrative protective order, whether the person desires to include such information in a petition filed under § 207.10, or any other submission to the Commission during the course of an investigation. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary finds that such information is nondisclosable confidential business information. As defined in § 201.6(a)(2) of this chapter, nondisclosable confidential business information is privileged information, classified information, or specific information ( trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure. The request will be granted or denied not later than thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in a preliminary phase investigation) after the date on which the request is filed.

        (2)  A request for exemption from disclosure must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor. At the same time as the request is filed, one copy of the business proprietary information in question must be lodged with the Secretary solely for the purpose of obtaining a determination as to the request. The business proprietary information for which exemption from disclosure is sought shall remain the property of the requester, and shall not become or be incorporated into any agency record until such time as the request is granted. A request should, when possible, be filed two business days prior to the deadline, if any, for filing the document in which the information for which exemption from disclosure is sought is proposed to be included. If the request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary finds that such information is privileged information, classified information, or specific information of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure. The Secretary shall promptly notify the requester as to whether the request has been approved or denied.

        (3)  If the request is approved, the person shall file three versions of the submission containing the nondisclosable confidential business information in question. One version shall contain all business proprietary information, bracketed in accordance with § 201.6 of this chapter and § 207.3. The other two versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 201.6 of this chapter and § 207.3, except that the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was granted shall be redacted from the submission.

        (4)  If the request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester. The requester may file the submission in question without that information, in accordance with the requirements of § 207.3.

        Procedures for Imposing Sanctions for Violation of the Provisions of a Protective Order Issued During Panel and Committee Proceedings

          § 207.100   Sanctions.

#### § § 207.100

          (a) A person, other than a person exempted from this regulation by the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(4), who is determined under this subpart to have committed a prohibited act, may be subject to one or more of the following sanctions:

          (1) A civil penalty not to exceed $100,000 for each violation, each day of a continuing violation constituting a separate violation;

          (2) Debarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission, which disbarment may, in appropriate circumstances, include such person's partners, associates, employers and employees, for a designated time period following publication of a determination that the protective order has been breached;

          (3) Denial of further access to proprietary or privileged information covered by the breached protective order or to proprietary information in future Commission proceedings;

          (4) An official reprimand by the Commission;

          (5) In the case of an attorney, accountant, or other professional, referral of the facts underlying the prohibited act to the ethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate professional association or licensing authority;

          (6) When appropriate, referral of the facts underlying the violation to the United States Trade Representative or his or her designees, or to another government agency; and

          (7) Any other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines to be appropriate.

          (b) Each partner, associate, employer, and employee described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is entitled to all the administrative rights set forth in this subpart.

          (c) For the purposes of this subpart, the knowing receipt of information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of a protective order includes, but is not limited to, the reading or unauthorized dissemination of the information covered by a protective order by a person who knows or should reasonably believe that he or she is not authorized to read or disseminate such information.

          § 207.101   Reporting of prohibited act and commencement of investigation.

#### § § 207.101

          (a) Any person who has information indicating that a prohibited act has been committed shall immediately report all pertinent facts relating thereto to the Commission Secretary.

          (b) Upon receipt, the Commission Secretary shall record the information, assign an investigation number, and forward all information he or she received to the Office of Unfair Import Investigations.

          (c) As expeditiously as possible, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations shall conduct an inquiry to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have committed a prohibited act. At any time, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations may request that the Commission assign an administrative law judge to oversee the inquiry.

          (d) At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations shall assess whether the available information is sufficient to provide reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have committed a prohibited act.

          § 207.102   Initiation of proceedings.

#### § § 207.102

          (a) Upon completion of the inquiry,

          (1) If the Office of Unfair Import Investigations concludes that there is not reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have committed a prohibited act, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations shall:

          (i) Submit a report to the Commission; and

          (ii) Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the file shall be closed and returned to the Commission Secretary.

          (2) If the Office of Unfair Import Investigations concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have committed a prohibited act, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations shall:

          (i) Make a recommendation to the Commission regarding whether and to what extent it is appropriate to notify the person whose proprietary information may have been compromised; and

          (ii) Submit a report and recommendation to the Commission regarding whether to initiate sanctions proceedings or to take other appropriate action.

          (b) The Commission may make any appropriate determination regarding the initiation of sanctions proceedings, including rejecting, approving, or approving and amending any recommendation made by the Office of Unfair Import Investigations.

          (c) If the Commission determines that it is appropriate to issue a charging letter, the Commission shall appoint an administrative law judge to oversee the proceeding and the Commission Secretary shall initiate a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a charging letter as set forth in 19 CFR 207.103.

          (d) If the Commission determines that it is appropriate to initiate proceedings, but that the party to be charged is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission and within the jurisdiction of another Free Trade Area country, or that for other reasons an authorized agency of another Free Trade Area country would be the more appropriate forum for initiation of a proceeding, the Commission shall take the necessary steps for issuance of a letter requesting the authorized agency of another Free Trade Area country to initiate proceedings under applicable law on the basis of an alleged prohibited act.

          (e) The Commission may make any determination regarding notification about the alleged prohibited act and the relevant underlying facts to the persons who submitted the proprietary information that allegedly has been disclosed. A determination by the Commission on this subject does not foreclose the administrative law judge from redetermining at any time during the hearing whether notification to the compromised party is appropriate.

          (f) If the Commission determines that it is not appropriate to issue a charging letter or to refer the facts to the authorized agency of another Free Trade Area country, the file shall be closed and returned to the Commission Secretary, unless the Commission directs otherwise.

          (g) All aspects of the inquiry shall remain confidential, except as deemed reasonably necessary to the Office of Unfair Import Investigations to gather relevant information and to protect the interests of the person who submitted the proprietary information, or except as otherwise ordered by the Commission. Except as the Commission may otherwise order, the Commission Secretary shall maintain all closed investigatory files in confidence to the extent permitted by law, and shall destroy any documentary evidence containing allegations of a prohibited act for which no proceeding is initiated one year after the file is closed.

          § 207.103   Charging letter.

#### § § 207.103

          (a)  Each charged party shall be served by the Commission with a copy of a charging letter and any accompanying motion for interim measures, as provided for in 19 CFR 207.106. The charging letter shall include:

          (3) A statement that a proceeding has been initiated and that an APA hearing will be held before an administrative law judge;

          (5) A statement that the charged party has a right to retain an attorney at the charged party's own expense for purposes of representation; and

          (6) A statement that the charged party has the right to request in the response described in § 207.104 of this subpart that the proceedings remain confidential to the extent practicable.

          (b)  (1) The charging letter shall be served in a double envelope. The inner envelope shall indicate that it is to be opened only by the addressee. Service of a charging letter shall be made by one of the following methods:

          (i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the charged party at the party's last known permanent address; or

          (ii) Personal service; or

          (iii) Any other method acceptable under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

          (2) Service shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service.

          (c)  Prior to entry of an order by the administrative law judge under § 207.105 of this subpart, the charging letter will be confidential and disclosed only to necessary Commission staff and the charged parties.

          (d)  (1) At any time after proceedings have been initiated, the investigative attorney may move for leave to amend or withdraw the charging letter.

          (2) If the administrative law judge determines that the charging letter should be amended to include additional parties, the judge shall issue a recommended determination to that effect. The Commission shall review the recommended determination, and issue a determination granting or denying the motion to amend the charging letter to include additional parties.

          (3) Upon motion, the administrative law judge may grant leave to amend the charging letter for good cause shown upon such conditions as are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties already charged.

          (4) Any amended charging letter shall be served upon all charged parties in the form and manner set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

          § 207.104   Response to charging letter.

#### § § 207.104

          (a)  A charged party shall have twenty (20) days from the date of service of the charging letter within which to file a written response to the allegations made in the charging letter unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.

Each charged party shall respond to each allegation in the charging letter, and may set forth a concise statement of the facts constituting each ground of defense. There shall be a specific admission or denial of each fact alleged in the charging letter, or if the charged party is without knowledge of any such fact, a statement to that effect.

          (c)  The response shall contain a statement as to whether the charged party seeks an order to maintain the confidentiality of all or part of the proceedings to the extent practicable, pursuant to § 207.105 of this subpart.

          § 207.105   Confidentiality.

#### § § 207.105

          (a)  As the administrative law judge deems reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of a charged party, the attorney for the charged party may be granted access in these proceedings to proprietary information or to the privileged information, the disclosure of which is the subject of the proceedings. Any such access shall be under protective order consistent with the provisions of this subpart.

          (b)  Upon the request of any charged party pursuant to § 207.106 of this subpart, the administrative law judge will issue an appropriate confidentiality order. This order will provide for the confidentiality, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, of information relating to allegations concerning the commitment of a prohibited act, consistent with public policy considerations and the needs of the parties in conducting the sanctions proceedings. The order will provide that all proceedings under this provision shall be kept confidential within the terms of the order, except to the extent that a discussion of such proceedings is incorporated into a published final decision of the Commission. Any confidential information not disclosed in such decision will remain protected.

          § 207.106   Interim measures.

#### § § 207.106

          (a) At any time after proceedings are initiated, the administrative law judge, upon motion, or on his or her own initiative, may issue a recommended determination to revoke the allegedly-violated protective order, to disclose information about the proceedings that would otherwise be kept confidential, or to take other appropriate interim measures.

          (b) Before issuing a determination recommending interim sanctions, the administrative law judge shall afford a party against whom such measures are proposed the opportunity to oppose them. The administrative law judge shall ordinarily decide any motion under this section no more than twenty (20) days after it is filed.

          (c) The Commission shall review any recommended determination regarding the imposition of interim measures within twenty (20) days from its issuance or such other time as it may order. The Commission may impose any appropriate interim sanctions.

          (d) The administrative law judge may recommend to the Commission that interim measures be modified or revoked. The Commission shall rule on such recommendation within ten (10) days after its issuance or such other time as it may order.

          (e) The Commission Secretary shall immediately notify the Secretariat of any interim measures that revoke or modify an outstanding protective order in an ongoing panel review. The Commission Secretary shall also immediately notify the Secretariat of any revocation or modification of an interim measure.

          § 207.107   Motions.

#### § § 207.107

          (a)  (1) After issuance of the charging letter and while part of the proceeding is pending before the administrative law judge, all motions relating to that part of the proceeding shall be addressed to the administrative law judge.

          (2) While part of a proceeding is pending before the Commission, all motions relating to that part of the proceeding shall be addressed to the Chairman of the Commission. All written motions shall be filed with the Commission Secretary and served upon all parties.

          As soon as practicable after the response to the charging letter is filed, the administrative law judge shall direct counsel or other representatives for the parties to meet with him or her at a preliminary conference, unless the administrative law judge determines that such a conference is not necessary. At the conference, the administrative law judge shall consider the issuance of such orders as the administrative law judge deems necessary for the conduct of the proceedings.

        (10) Acknowledge that breach of the administrative protective order may subject the authorized applicant to such sanctions or other actions as the Commission deems appropriate.

        (c)  At such date as the Secretary may determine appropriate for particular data, each authorized applicant shall destroy all physical and electronic copies of materials released to authorized applicants pursuant to this section and all other materials containing confidential business information, such as charts or notes based on any such information received under administrative protective order, and file with the Secretary a certificate attesting to the applicant's personal, good faith belief that all copies of such material have been returned or destroyed and no copies of such material have been made available to any person to whom disclosure was not specifically authorized.

        (d)  A breach of an administrative protective order may subject an offender to:

        (1) Disbarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission along with such person's partners, associates, employer, and employees, for up to seven years following publication of a determination that the order has been breached;

        (2) Referral to the United States Attorney;

        (3) In the case of an attorney, accountant, or other professional, referral to the ethics panel of the appropriate professional association;

        (4) Such other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines to be appropriate, including public release of or striking from the record any information or briefs submitted by, or on behalf of, the offender or the party represented by the offender, denial of further access to confidential business information in the current or any future investigations before the Commission, and issuance of a public or private letter of reprimand; and

        (5) Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.

        (e)  (1) The Commission shall determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the later of;

        (i) The date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care; or

        (ii) Upon the completion of an investigation conducted under this subpart, the Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of an administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time during the pendency of the investigation. Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe that a breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present views on whether a breach has occurred. If the Commission subsequently determines that a breach has occurred and that further investigation is warranted, then the Secretary shall issue a letter informing such person of that determination and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to present views on whether mitigating circumstances exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but no longer on whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to present views, the Commission shall determine what sanction, if any, to impose.

        (2) Where the sanction imposed is a private letter of reprimand, the Secretary shall expunge the sanction from the recipient's record two (2) years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that

        (i) The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two-year period, and

        (ii) The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at the end of the two-year period. Upon the completion of such a pending breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.

        (f)  (1) Any party filing written submissions that include confidential business information to the Commission during an investigation shall at the same time serve complete copies of such submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and, except as provided in § 208.20(c), a nonconfidential version on all other parties. All such submissions must be accompanied by a certificate attesting that complete copies of the submission have been properly served. In the event that a submission is filed before the Secretary's list is established, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the submission shall be served within two (2) days of the establishment of the list and a certificate of service shall then be filed.

        (2) A party may seek an exemption from the service requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section for particular confidential business information by filing a request for exemption from disclosure in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. The Secretary shall promptly respond to the request. If a request is granted, the Secretary shall accept the information. The party shall file three versions of the submission containing the information in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and serve the submission in accordance with the requirements of § 208.20(b) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section, with the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure under administrative protective order has been granted redacted from the copies served. If a request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester.

        (3) The Secretary shall not accept for filing into the record of an investigation submissions filed without a proper certificate of service. Failure to comply with paragraph (f) of this section may result in denial of party status and such sanctions as the Commission deems appropriate. Confidential business information in submissions must be clearly marked as such when submitted by enclosing such information within brackets, and it must be segregated from other material being submitted.

        (g)  (1)  Any person may request exemption from the disclosure of confidential business information under administrative protective order, whether the person desires to include such information in a petition filed under this part, or any other submission to the Commission during the course of an investigation under this part. Such a request shall be granted only if the Secretary finds that such information is non-disclosable confidential business information. As defined in § 201.6(a)(2) of this chapter, non-disclosable confidential business information is privileged information, classified information, or specific information ( trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure.

        (2)  A request for exemption from disclosure must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor. At the same time as the request is filed, one copy of the confidential business information in question must be lodged with the Secretary solely for the purpose of obtaining a determination as to the request. The confidential business information for which exemption from disclosure is sought shall remain the property of the requester, and it shall not become or be incorporated into any agency record until such time as the request is granted. A request should, when possible, be filed two business days prior to the deadline, if any, for filing the document in which the information for which exemption from disclosure is sought is proposed to be included. The Secretary shall promptly notify the requester as to whether the request has been approved or denied.

        (3)  If the request is approved, the person shall file three versions of the submission containing the non-disclosable confidential business information in question. One version shall contain all confidential business information, bracketed in accordance with § 201.6 of this chapter and § 208.20(c), with the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was granted enclosed in triple brackets. This version shall have the following warning marked on every page: “CBI exempted from disclosure under APO enclosed in triple brackets.” The other two versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 201.6 of this chapter and § 208.20(c), except that the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was granted shall be redacted from those versions of the submission.

        (4)  If the request is denied, the copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the requester.

        § 210.4   Written submissions; representations; sanctions.

#### § § 210.4

        (a)  The front page of every written submission filed by a party or a proposed party to an investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the Commission, the title of the investigation or related proceeding, the docket number or investigation number, if any, assigned to the investigation or related proceeding, and in the case of a complaint, the names of the complainant and all proposed respondents.

        (b)  Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party or proposed party who is represented by an attorney in an investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name. A party or proposed party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign, or his duly authorized officer or agent shall sign, the pleading, written motion, or other paper. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Pleadings, written motions, and other papers need not be under oath or accompanied by an affidavit, except as provided in § 210.12(a)(1), § 210.13(b), § 210.18, § 210.52(d), § 210.59(b), or another section of this part or by order of the administrative law judge or the Commission. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after omission of the signature is called to the attention of the submitter.

        (c)  By presenting to the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party or proposed party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances—

        (1) It is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the investigation or related proceeding;

        (2) The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;

        (3) The allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and

        (4) The denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.

        (d)  If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond (see paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section and § 210.25), the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission determines that paragraph (c) of this section has been violated, the administrative law judge or the Commission may, subject to the conditions stated below and in § 210.25, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated paragraph (c) or are responsible for the violation. A representation need not be frivolous in its entirety in order for the administrative law judge or the Commission to determine that paragraph (c) has been violated. If any portion of a representation is found to be false, frivolous, misleading, or otherwise in violation of paragraph (c), a sanction may be imposed. In determining whether paragraph (c) has been violated, the administrative law judge or the Commission will consider whether the representation or disputed portion thereof was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.

        (1) —(i)  A motion for sanctions under this section shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate paragraph (c). It shall be served as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but shall not be filed with or presented to the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission unless, within seven days after service of the motion (or such other period as the administrative law judge or the Commission may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. See also § 210.25 (a) through (c). If warranted, the administrative law judge or the Commission may award to the party or proposed party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.

        (ii)  The administrative law judge or the Commission may enter an order sua sponte describing the specific conduct that appears to violate paragraph (c) of this section and directing an attorney, law firm, party, or proposed party to show cause why it has not violated paragraph (c) with respect thereto.

        (2)  A sanction imposed for violation of paragraph (c) of this section shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.

        (i) Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.

        (ii) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party or proposed party for a violation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (iii) Monetary sanctions may not be imposed on the administrative law judge's or the Commission's initiative unless—

        (A) The Commission or the administrative law judge issues an order to show cause before the investigation or related proceeding is terminated, in whole or in relevant part, as to the party or proposed party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned; and

        (B) Such termination is the result of—

        () A motion to withdraw the complaint, motion, or petition that was the basis for the investigation or related proceeding;

        () A settlement agreement;

        () A consent order agreement; or

        () An arbitration agreement.

        (iv) Monetary sanctions imposed to compensate the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations will include reimbursement for some or all costs reasonably incurred as a direct result of the violation, but will not include attorney's fees.

        (3)  When imposing sanctions, the administrative law judge or the Commission shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed. See also § 210.25(d)-(f).

        (e)  Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply to discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to provisions of §§ 210.27 through 210.34.

        (f)  (1) Written submissions that are addressed to the Commission during an investigation or a related proceeding shall comply with the Commission's Handbook on Filing Procedures, which is issued by and available from the Secretary and posted on the Commission's Electronic Document Information System Web site at  Failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the Handbook on Filing Procedures in the filing of a document may result in the rejection of the document as improperly filed.

        (2) A complaint, petition, or request, and supplements and amendments thereto, filed under § 210.8, § 210.75, § 210.76, or § 210.79 shall be filed in paper form.

Submitted media will be retained by the Commission, except that media may be returned to the submitter if a document is not accepted for filing.

        (3) Responses to a complaint, briefs, comments and responses thereto, compliance reports, motions and responses or replies thereto, petitions and replies thereto, prehearing statements, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and responses thereto provided for under §§ 210.4(d), 210.13, 210.8, 210.14, 210.15, 210.16, 210.17, 210.18, 210.19, 210.20, 210.21, 210.23, 210.24, 210.25, 210.26, 210.33, 210.34, 210.35, 210.36, 210.38, 210.40, 210.43, 210.45, 210.46, 210.47, 210.50, 210.52, 210.53, 210.57, 210.59, 210.66, 210.70, or 210.71; and submissions filed with the Secretary pursuant to an order of the presiding administrative law judge shall be filed electronically, and true paper copies of such submissions shall be filed by 12 noon, eastern time, on the next business day.

        (4) Except for the documents listed in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, all other documents shall be filed electronically, and no paper copies will be required.

        (5) If paper copies are required under this section, the required number of paper copies shall be governed by paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

        (ii) Eight (8) true paper copies of each submission shall be filed if the investigation or related proceeding is before the Commission.

        (7)(i) If a complaint, a supplement or amendment to a complaint, a motion for temporary relief, or the documentation supporting a motion for temporary relief contains confidential business information as defined in § 201.6(a) of this chapter, the complainant shall file nonconfidential copies of the complaint, the supplement or amendment to the complaint, the motion for temporary relief, or the documentation supporting the motion for temporary relief concurrently with the requisite confidential copies, as provided in § 210.8(a). A nonconfidential copy of all exhibits, appendices, and attachments to the document shall be filed in electronic form on one CD-ROM, DVD, or other portable electronic media approved by the Secretary, separate from the media used for the confidential version.

        (ii)(A) Persons who file the following submissions that contain confidential business information covered by an administrative protective order, or that are the subject of a request for confidential treatment, must file nonconfidential copies and serve them on the other parties to the investigation or related proceeding within 10 calendar days after filing the confidential version with the Commission:

        () All submissions relating to a motion to amend the complaint or notice of investigation; and

        () All submissions addressed to the Commission.

        (B) Other sections of this part may require, or the Commission or the administrative law judge may order, the filing and service of nonconfidential copies of other kinds of confidential submissions. If the submitter's ability to prepare a nonconfidential copy is dependent upon receipt of the nonconfidential version of an initial determination, or a Commission order or opinion, or a ruling by the administrative law judge or the Commission as to whether some or all of the information at issue is entitled to confidential treatment, the nonconfidential copies of the submission must be filed within 10 calendar days after service of the Commission or administrative law judge document in question. The time periods for filing specified in this paragraph apply unless the Commission, the administrative law judge, or another section of this part specifically provides otherwise.

        (9)  Documents shall be filed at the Office of the Secretary of the Commission in Washington, DC. Such documents, if properly filed within the hours of operation specified in § 201.3(c), will be deemed to be filed on the date on which they are actually received in the Commission.

        (11) During any period in which the Commission is closed, deadlines for filing documents electronically and by other means are extended so that documents are due on the first business day after the end of the closure.

        (g)  When making a paper filing, parties must complete the cover sheet online at  and print out the cover sheet for submission to the Office of the Secretary with the paper filing.

        (e)  (1) If an investigation is instituted or if a related proceeding is assigned to an administrative law judge, the administrative law judge shall set the ground rules for the designation, submission, and handling of information designated confidential by the submitter. When requested to do so, the administrative law judge shall decide whether information in a document addressed to the administrative law judge, or to be exchanged among the parties while the administrative law judge is presiding, is entitled to confidential treatment. The administrative law judge shall also decide, with respect to all orders, initial determinations, or other documents issued by the administrative law judge, whether information designated confidential by the supplier is entitled to confidential treatment. The supplier of the information or the person seeking the information may, with leave of the administrative law judge, request an appeal to the Commission of the administrative law judge's unfavorable ruling on this issue, under § 210.24(b)(2).

        (2) The Commission may continue protective orders issued by the administrative law judge, amend or revoke those orders, or issue new ones.

        (f) When the Commission or the administrative law judge issues a confidential version of an order, initial determination, opinion, or other document, the Commission, or the presiding administrative law judge if the administrative law judge has issued the confidential version, shall issue any public version of the document within 30 days, unless good cause exists to extend the deadline. An administrative law judge or the Commission may extend this time by order. Upon request by the Commission, or the administrative law judge if the administrative law judge has issued the confidential version, parties must provide support in the record for their claim of confidentiality, pursuant § 201.6 of this chapter and § 210.4 of this subpart for any proposed redactions that parties may submit to the Commission or the administrative law judge for the preparation of any public version.

        § 210.13   The response.

#### § § 210.13

        (a)  Except as provided in § 210.59(a) and unless otherwise ordered in the notice of investigation or by the administrative law judge, respondents shall have 20 days from the date of service of the complaint and notice of investigation, by the Commission under § 210.11(a) or by a party under § 210.11(b), within which to file a written response to the complaint and the notice of investigation. When the investigation involves a motion for temporary relief and has not been declared “more complicated,” the response to the complaint and notice of investigation must be filed along with the response to the motion for temporary relief—i.e., within 10 days after service of the complaint, notice of investigation, and the motion for temporary relief by the Commission under § 210.11(a) or by a party under § 210.11(b). (See § 210.59.)

        (b)  In addition to conforming to the requirements of §§ 210.4 and 210.5 of this part, each response shall be under oath and signed by respondent or his duly authorized officer, attorney, or agent with the name, address, and telephone number of the respondent and any such officer, attorney, or agent given on the first page of the response. Each respondent shall respond to each allegation in the complaint and in the notice of investigation, and shall set forth a concise statement of the facts constituting each ground of defense. There shall be a specific admission, denial, or explanation of each fact alleged in the complaint and notice, or if the respondent is without knowledge of any such fact, a statement to that effect. Allegations of a complaint and notice not thus answered may be deemed to have been admitted. Each response shall include, when available, statistical data on the quantity and value of imports of the involved article. Respondents who are importers must also provide the Harmonized Tariff Schedule item number(s) for importations of the accused imports occurring on or after January 1, 1989, and the Tariff Schedules of the United States item number(s) for importations occurring before January 1, 1989. Each response shall also include a statement concerning the respondent's capacity to produce the subject article and the relative significance of the United States market to its operations. Respondents who are not manufacturing their accused imports shall state the name and address of the supplier(s) of those imports. Affirmative defenses shall be pleaded with as much specificity as possible in the response. When the alleged unfair methods of competition and unfair acts are based upon the claims of a valid U.S. patent, the respondent is encouraged to make the following showing when appropriate:

        (1) If it is asserted in defense that the article imported or sold by respondents is not covered by, or produced under a process covered by, the claims of each involved U.S. patent, a showing of such noncoverage for each involved claim in each U.S. patent in question shall be made, which showing may be made by appropriate allegations and, when practicable, by a chart that applies the involved claims of each U.S. patent in question to a representative involved imported article of the respondent or to the process under which such article was produced;

        (2) Drawings, photographs, or other visual representations of the involved imported article of respondent or the process utilized in producing such article, and, when a chart is furnished under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the parts of such drawings, photographs, or other visual representations, should be labeled so that they can be read in conjunction with such chart; and

        (3) If the claims of any involved U.S. patent are asserted to be invalid or unenforceable, the basis for such assertion, including, when prior art is relied on, a showing of how the prior art renders each claim invalid or unenforceable and a copy of such prior art. For good cause, the presiding administrative law judge may waive any of the substantive requirements imposed under this paragraph or may impose additional requirements.

        (c)  At the time the response is filed, if practicable, the respondent shall submit the accused article imported or sold by that respondent, unless the article has already been submitted by the complainant.

        § 210.14   Amendments to pleadings and notice; supplemental submissions; counterclaims; consolidation of investigations.

#### § § 210.14

        (a)  The complaint may be amended at any time prior to the institution of the investigation. If, prior to institution, the complainant seeks to amend a complaint to add a respondent or to assert an additional unfair act not in the original complaint, including asserting a new patent or patent claim, then the complaint shall be treated as if it had been filed on the date the amendment is filed for purposes of §§ 210.8(b) and (c), 210.9, and 210.10(a).

        (b)  (1) After an investigation has been instituted, the complaint or notice of investigation may be amended only by leave of the Commission for good cause shown and upon such conditions as are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties to the investigation. A motion for amendment must be made to the presiding administrative law judge. A motion to amend the complaint and notice of investigation to name an additional respondent after institution shall be served on the proposed respondent. If the proposed amendment of the complaint would require amending the notice of investigation, the presiding administrative law judge may grant the motion only by filing with the Commission an initial determination. All other dispositions of such motions shall be by order.

        (2) If disposition of the issues in an investigation on the merits will be facilitated, or for other good cause shown, the presiding administrative law judge may allow appropriate amendments to pleadings other than complaints upon such conditions as are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties to the investigation.

        (c)  When issues not raised by the pleadings or notice of investigation, but reasonably within the scope of the pleadings and notice, are considered during the taking of evidence by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings and notice. Such amendments of the pleadings and notice as may be necessary to make them conform to the evidence and to raise such issues shall be allowed at any time, and shall be effective with respect to all parties who have expressly or impliedly consented.

        (d)  The administrative law judge may, upon reasonable notice and on such terms as are just, permit service of a supplemental submission setting forth transactions, occurrences, or events that have taken place since the date of the submission sought to be supplemented and that are relevant to any of the issues involved.

        (e)  At any time after institution of the investigation, but not later than ten business days before the commencement of the evidentiary hearing, a respondent may file a counterclaim at the Commission in accordance with section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930. Counterclaims shall be filed in a separate document. A respondent who files such a counterclaim shall immediately file a notice of removal with a United States district court in which venue for any of the counterclaims raised by the respondent would exist under 28 U.S.C. 1391.

        (f)  When the Commission has ordered the administrative law judge to take evidence with respect to the public interest under § 210.50(b)(1), respondents must submit a statement concerning the public interest, including any response to the issues raised by the complainant pursuant to § 210.8(b) and (c)(2), at the same time that their response to the complaint is due. This submission must be no longer than five pages, inclusive of attachments.

        (g)  The Commission may consolidate two or more investigations. If the investigations are currently before the same presiding administrative law judge, he or she may consolidate the investigations. The investigation number in the caption of the consolidated investigation will include the investigation numbers of the investigations being consolidated. The investigation number in which the matter will be proceeding (the lead investigation) will be the first investigation number named in the consolidated caption.

        (h)  The administrative law judge may determine to sever an investigation into two or more investigations at any time prior to or upon thirty days from institution, based upon either a motion by any party or upon the administrative law judge's own judgment that severance is necessary to allow efficient adjudication. The administrative law judge's decision will be in the form of an order. The newly severed investigation(s) shall remain with the same presiding administrative law judge unless reassigned at the discretion of the chief administrative law judge. The severed investigation(s) will be designated with new investigation numbers.

      Subpart D—Motions

        § 210.15   Motions.

#### § § 210.15

        (a)  (1) During the period between the institution of an investigation and the assignment of the investigation to a presiding administrative law judge, all motions shall be addressed to the chief administrative law judge. During the time that an investigation or related proceeding is before an administrative law judge, all motions therein shall be addressed to the administrative law judge.

        (2) When an investigation or related proceeding is before the Commission, all motions shall be addressed to the Chairman of the Commission. All such motions shall be filed with the Secretary and shall be served upon each party. Motions may not be filed with the Commission during preinstitution proceedings except for motions for temporary relief pursuant to § 210.53.

        (b)  All written motions shall state the particular order, ruling, or action desired and the grounds therefor.

        (c)  Within 10 days after service of any written motions, or within such longer or shorter time as may be designated by the administrative law judge or the Commission, a nonmoving party, or in the instance of a motion to amend the complaint or notice of investigation to name an additional respondent after institution, the proposed respondent, shall respond or he may be deemed to have consented to the granting of the relief asked for in the motion. The moving party shall have no right to reply, except as permitted by the administrative law judge or the Commission.

        (d)  As a matter of discretion, the administrative law judge or the Commission may waive the requirements of this section as to motions for extension of time, and may rule upon such motions ex parte.

        § 210.16   Default.

#### § § 210.16

        (a)  (1) A party shall be found in default if it fails to respond to the complaint and notice of investigation in the manner prescribed in § 210.13 or § 210.59(c), or otherwise fails to answer the complaint and notice, and fails to show cause why it should not be found in default.

        (2) A party may be found in default as a sanction for abuse of process, under § 210.4(c), or failure to make or cooperate in discovery, under § 210.33(b).

        (b)  (1)(i) If a respondent has failed to respond or appear in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a party may file a motion for, or the administrative law judge may issue upon his own initiative, an order directing respondent to show cause why it should not be found in default.

        (ii) If the respondent fails to make the necessary showing pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the administrative law judge shall issue an initial determination finding the respondent in default. An administrative law judge's decision denying a motion for a finding of default under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be in the form of an order.

        (2) Any party may file a motion for issuance of, or the administrative law judge may issue on his own initiative, an initial determination finding a party in default for abuse of process under § 210.4(c) or failure to make or cooperate in discovery. A motion for a finding of default as a sanction for abuse of process or failure to make or cooperate in discovery shall be granted by initial determination or denied by order.

        (3) If a proposed respondent has not filed a response to the complaint and notice of investigation pursuant to § 210.13 or § 210.59(c) of this chapter, the proposed respondent may file a notice of intent to default under this section. The filing of a notice of intent to default does not require the administrative law judge to issue the show-cause order of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The administrative law judge shall issue an initial determination finding the proposed respondent in default upon the filing of a notice of intent to default. Such default will be treated in the same manner as any default under this section.

        (4) A party found in default shall be deemed to have waived its right to appear, to be served with documents, and to contest the allegations at issue in the investigation.

        (c) —(1)  After a respondent has been found in default by the Commission, the complainant may file with the Commission a declaration that it is seeking immediate entry of relief against the respondent in default. The facts alleged in the complaint will be presumed to be true with respect to the defaulting respondent. The Commission may issue an exclusion order, a cease and desist order, or both, affecting the defaulting respondent only after considering the effect of such order(s) upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers, and concluding that the order(s) should still be issued in light of the aforementioned public interest factors.

        (2)  In any motion requesting the entry of default or the termination of the investigation with respect to the last remaining respondent in the investigation, the complainant shall declare whether it is seeking a general exclusion order. The Commission may issue a general exclusion order pursuant to section 337(g)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, regardless of the source or importer of the articles concerned, provided that a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is established by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence and that the other requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1337(d)(2) are satisfied, and only after considering the aforementioned public interest factors and the requirements of § 210.50(c).

        § 210.17   Other failure to act and default.

#### § § 210.17

        Failures to act other than the defaults listed in § 210.16 may provide a basis for the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission to draw adverse inferences and to issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, determinations (including a determination on violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930), and orders that are adverse to the party who fails to act. Such failures include, but are not limited to:

        (a) Failure to respond to a motion that materially alters the scope of the investigation or a related proceeding;

        (b) Failure to respond to a motion for temporary relief pursuant to § 210.59;

        (c) Failure to respond to a motion for summary determination under § 210.18;

        (d) Failure to appear at a hearing before the administrative law judge after filing a written response to the complaint or motion for temporary relief, or failure to appear at a hearing before the Commission;

        (e) Failure to file a brief or other written submission requested by the administrative law judge or the Commission during an investigation or a related proceeding;

        (f) Failure to respond to a petition for review of an initial determination, a petition for reconsideration of an initial determination, or an application for interlocutory review of an administrative law judge's order; and

        (g) Failure to participate in temporary relief bond forfeiture proceedings under § 210.70.

        (h)  If a respondent has filed a response to the complaint or notice of investigation under § 210.13 of this chapter, the respondent may still file a notice of intent to default with the presiding administrative law judge at any time before the filing of the final initial determination. The administrative law judge shall issue an initial determination finding the respondent in default upon the filing of a notice of intent to default. Such default will be treated in the same manner as any other failure to act under this section. The filing of a notice of intent to default does not require the administrative law judge to issue an order to show cause as to why the respondent should not be found in default.

        § 210.18   Summary determinations.

#### § § 210.18

        (a)  Any party may move with any necessary supporting affidavits for a summary determination in its favor upon all or any part of the issues to be determined in the investigation. Counsel or other representatives in support of the complaint may so move at any time after 20 days following the date of service of the complaint and notice instituting the investigation. Any other party or a respondent may so move at any time after the date of publication of the notice of investigation in the  Any such motion by any party in connection with the issue of permanent relief, however, must be filed at least 60 days before the date fixed for any hearing provided for in § 210.36(a)(1). Notwithstanding any other rule, the deadline for filing summary determinations shall be computed by counting backward at least 60 days including the first calendar day prior to the date the hearing is scheduled to commence. If the end of the 60 day period falls on a weekend or holiday, the period extends until the end of the next business day. Under exceptional circumstances and upon motion, the presiding administrative law judge may determine that good cause exists to permit a summary determination motion to be filed out of time.

        (b)  Any nonmoving party may file opposing affidavits within 10 days after service of the motion for summary determination. The administrative law judge may, in his discretion or at the request of any party, set the matter for oral argument and call for the submission of briefs or memoranda. The determination sought by the moving party shall be rendered if pleadings and any depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a summary determination as a matter of law.

        (c)  Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The administrative law judge may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for summary determination is made and supported as provided in this section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the opposing party's pleading, but the opposing party's response, by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, or as otherwise provided in this section, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the evidentiary hearing under § 210.36(a)(1) or (2). If the opposing party does not so respond, a summary determination, if appropriate, shall be rendered against the opposing party.

        (d)  Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the administrative law judge may refuse the application for summary determination, or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is appropriate, and a ruling to that effect shall be made a matter of record.

        (e)  If on motion under this section a summary determination is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a hearing is necessary, the administrative law judge, by examining the pleadings and the evidence and by interrogating counsel if necessary, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. The administrative law judge shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy and directing such further proceedings in the investigation as are warranted. The facts so specified shall be deemed established.

        (f)  An order of summary determination shall constitute an initial determination of the administrative law judge.

        § 210.19   Intervention.

#### § § 210.19

        Any person desiring to intervene in an investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall make a written motion after institution of the investigation or related proceeding. The motion shall have attached to it a certificate showing that the motion has been served upon each party to the investigation or related proceeding in the manner described in § 201.16(b) of this chapter. Any party may file a response to the motion in accordance with § 210.15(c) of this part, provided that the response is accompanied by a certificate confirming that the response was served on the proposed intervenor and all other parties. The Commission, or the administrative law judge by initial determination, may grant the motion to the extent and upon such terms as may be proper under the circumstances.

        § 210.20   Declassification of confidential information.

#### § § 210.20

        (a) Any party may move to declassify documents (or portions thereof) that have been designated confidential by the submitter but that do not satisfy the confidentiality criteria set forth in § 201.6(a) of this chapter. All such motions, whether brought at any time during the investigation or after conclusion of the investigation shall be addressed to and ruled upon by the presiding administrative law judge, or if the investigation is not before a presiding administrative law judge, by the chief administrative law judge or such administrative law judge as he may designate.

        (b) Following issuance of a public version of the initial determination on whether there is a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or an initial determination that would otherwise terminate the investigation (if adopted by the Commission), the granting of a motion, in whole or part, to declassify information designated confidential shall constitute an initial determination, except as to that information for which no submissions in opposition to declassification have been filed.

        § 210.21   Termination of investigations.

#### § § 210.21

        (a)  (1) Any party may move at any time prior to the issuance of an initial determination on violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to terminate an investigation in whole or in part as to any or all respondents, on the basis of withdrawal of the complaint or certain allegations contained therein, or for good cause other than the grounds listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A motion for termination of an investigation based on withdrawal of the complaint, or for good cause, shall contain a statement that there are no agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties concerning the subject matter of the investigation, or if there are any agreements concerning the subject matter of the investigation, all such agreements shall be identified, and if written, a copy shall be filed with the Commission along with the motion. If the agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6(a) of this chapter, at least one copy of the agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion, in addition to a copy of the confidential version. On motion for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may limit service of the agreements to the settling parties and the Commission investigative attorney. The presiding administrative law judge may grant the motion in an initial determination upon such terms and conditions as he deems proper.

        (2) Any party may move at any time to terminate an investigation in whole or in part as to any or all respondents on the basis of a settlement, a licensing or other agreement, including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration, or a consent order, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.

        (b)  (1) An investigation before the Commission may be terminated as to one or more respondents pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a licensing or other settlement agreement. The motion for termination by settlement shall contain copies of the licensing or other settlement agreements, any supplemental agreements, any documents referenced in the motion or attached agreements, and a statement that there are no other agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties concerning the subject matter of the investigation. If the licensing or other settlement agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion. On motion for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may limit the service of the agreements to the settling parties and the Commission investigative attorney.

        (2) The motion and agreement(s) shall be certified by the administrative law judge to the Commission with an initial determination if the motion for termination is granted. If the licensing or other agreement or the initial determination contains confidential business information, copies of the agreement and initial determination with confidential business information deleted shall be certified to the Commission simultaneously with the confidential versions of such documents. If the Commission's final disposition of the initial determination results in termination of the investigation in its entirety, a notice will be published in the  Termination by settlement need not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

        (c)  An investigation before the Commission may be terminated pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a consent order. Termination by consent order need not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337. A motion for termination by consent order shall contain copies of any licensing or other settlement agreement, any supplemental agreements, and a statement that there are no other agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties concerning the subject matter of the investigation. If the licensing or other settlement agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion. On motion for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may limit service of the agreements to the settling parties and the Commission investigative attorney. If there are no additional agreements, the moving parties shall certify that there are no additional agreements.

        (1) —(i)  Where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, any person being investigated pursuant to section 603 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2482) shall be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Commission a proposal for disposition of the matter under investigation in the form of a consent order stipulation that incorporates a proposed consent order executed by or on behalf of such person and that complies with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (ii)  In investigations under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, a proposal to terminate by consent order shall be submitted as a motion to the administrative law judge with a stipulation that incorporates a proposed consent order. If the stipulation contains confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the stipulation with such information deleted shall accompany the motion. The stipulation shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At any time prior to commencement of the hearing, the motion may be filed by one or more respondents, and may be filed jointly with other parties to the investigation. Upon request and for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may consider such a motion during or after a hearing. The filing of the motion shall not stay proceedings before the administrative law judge unless the administrative law judge so orders. The administrative law judge shall promptly file with the Commission an initial determination regarding the motion for termination if the motion is granted. If the initial determination contains confidential business information, a copy of the initial determination with such information deleted shall be filed with the Commission simultaneously with the filing of the confidential version of the initial determination. Pending disposition by the Commission of a consent order stipulation, a party may not, absent good cause shown, withdraw from the stipulation once it has been submitted pursuant to this section.

        (2)  The Commission, after considering the effect of the settlement by consent order upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers, shall dispose of the initial determination according to the procedures of §§ 210.42 through 210.45. If the Commission's final disposition of the initial determination results in termination of the investigation in its entirety, a notice will be published in the  Termination by consent order need not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337. Should the Commission reverse the initial determination, the parties are in no way bound by their proposal in later actions before the Commission.

        (C) An express waiver of all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity of the consent order;

        (D) A statement that the signatories to the consent order stipulation will cooperate with and will not seek to impede by litigation or other means the Commission's efforts to gather information under subpart I of this part;

        (E) A statement that the enforcement, modification, and revocation of the consent order will be carried out pursuant to subpart I of this part, incorporating by reference the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure;

        (F) A statement that the signing thereof is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute admission by any respondent that an unfair act has been committed, if applicable; and

        (G) A statement that the consent order shall have the same force and effect and may be enforced, modified, or revoked in the same manner as is provided in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and this part for other Commission actions, and the Commission may require periodic compliance reports pursuant to subpart I of this part to be submitted by the person entering into the consent order stipulation.

        (ii) In the case of an intellectual property-based investigation, the consent order stipulation shall also contain—

        (A) A statement that if any asserted patent claim, copyright, trademark, mask work, boat hull design, or unfair trade practice claim has expired or is held invalid or unenforceable by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction or if any article has been found or adjudicated not to infringe the asserted right in a final decision, no longer subject to appeal, this Consent Order shall become null and void as to such expired, invalid, or unenforceable claim or as to any adjudicated article;

        (B) A statement that each signatory to the stipulation who was a respondent in the investigation will not seek to challenge the validity of the intellectual property right(s), in any administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce the consent order

        (i) A statement of the identity of complainant, the respondent, and the subject articles, and a statement of any allegation in the complaint that the respondents sell for importation, import, or sell after importation the subject articles in violation of section 337 by reason of asserted patent claims, copyright, trademark, mask work, boat hull design, or unfair trade practice;

        (ii) A statement that the respondents have executed a consent order stipulation (but the consent order shall not contain the terms of the stipulation);

        (iii) A statement that the respondent shall not sell for importation, import, or sell after importation the subject articles, directly or indirectly, and shall not aid, abet, encourage, participate in, or induce the sale for importation, the importation, or the sale after importation except under consent, license from the complainant, or to the extent permitted by the settlement agreement between complainant and respondent;

        (iv) A statement, if applicable, regarding the disposition of existing U.S. inventories of the subject articles.

        (x) A statement that if any asserted patent claim, copyright, trademark, mask work, boat hull design, or unfair trade practice claim is held invalid or unenforceable by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction or if any article has been found or adjudicated not to infringe the asserted right in a final decision, no longer subject to appeal, this Consent Order shall become null and void as to such invalid or unenforceable claim or adjudicated article;

        (xi) An admission of all jurisdictional facts; and

        (xii) A statement that the investigation is hereby terminated with respect to the respondent; provided, however, that enforcement, modification, or revocation of the Consent Order shall be carried out pursuant to Subpart I of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR part 210.

        (5)  The consent order shall have the same force and effect and may be enforced, modified, or revoked in the same manner as is provided in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and this part for other Commission actions. The Commission will not enforce consent order terms beyond those provided for in this section. The Commission may require periodic compliance reports pursuant to subpart I of this part to be submitted by the person entering into the consent order stipulation.

        (d)  Upon filing of a motion for termination with the administrative law judge or the Commission, a section 337 investigation may be terminated as to one or more respondents pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of an agreement between complainant and one or more of the respondents to present the matter for arbitration. The motion and a copy of the arbitration agreement shall be certified by the administrative law judge to the Commission with an initial determination if the motion for termination is granted. If the agreement or the initial determination contains confidential business information, copies of the agreement and initial determination with confidential business information deleted shall be certified to the Commission with the confidential versions of such documents. A notice will be published in the  if the Commission's final disposition of the initial determination results in termination of the investigation in its entirety. Termination based on an arbitration agreement does not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

        (e)  Termination issued by the administrative law judge shall constitute an initial determination.

        § 210.23   Suspension of investigation.

#### § § 210.23

        Any party may move to suspend an investigation under this part, because of the pendency of proceedings before the Secretary of Commerce or the administering authority pursuant to section 337(b)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930. The administrative law judge or the Commission also may raise the issue sua sponte. An administrative law judge's decision granting a motion for suspension shall be in the form of an initial determination.

        § 210.24   Interlocutory appeals.

#### § § 210.24

        Rulings by the administrative law judge on motions may not be appealed to the Commission prior to the administrative law judge's issuance of an initial determination, except in the following circumstances:

        (a)  The Commission may in its discretion entertain interlocutory appeals, except as provided in § 210.64, when a ruling of the administrative law judge:

        (1) Requires the disclosure of Commission records or requires the appearance of Government officials pursuant to § 210.32(c)(2); or

        (2) Denies an application for intervention under § 210.19. Appeals from such rulings may be sought by filing an application for review, not to exceed 15 pages, with the Commission within five days after service of the administrative law judge's ruling. An answer to the application for review may be filed within five days after service of the application. The application for review should specify the person or party taking the appeal, designate the ruling or part thereof from which appeal is being taken, and specify the reasons and present arguments as to why review is being sought. The Commission may, upon its own motion, enter an order staying the return date of an order issued by the administrative law judge pursuant to § 210.32(c)(2) or may enter an order placing the matter on the Commission's docket for review. Any order placing the matter on the Commission's docket for review will set forth the scope of the review and the issues that will be considered and will make provision for the filing of briefs if deemed appropriate by the Commission.

        (b)  (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section, § 210.64, and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, applications for review of a ruling by an administrative law judge may be allowed only upon request made to the administrative law judge and upon determination by the administrative law judge in writing, with justification in support thereof, that the ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and that either an immediate appeal from the ruling may materially advance the ultimate completion of the investigation or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.

        (2) Applications for review of a ruling by an administrative law judge under § 210.5(e)(1) as to whether information designated confidential by the supplier is entitled to confidential treatment under § 210.5(b) may be allowed only upon request made to the administrative law judge and upon determination by the administrative law judge in writing, with justification in support thereof.

        (3) A written application for review under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall not exceed 15 pages and may be filed within five days after service of the administrative law judge's determination. An answer to the application for review may be filed within five days after service of the application for review. Thereupon, the Commission may, in its discretion, permit an appeal. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, Commission review, if permitted, shall be confined to the application for review and answer thereto, without oral argument or further briefs.

        (c)  Application for review under this section shall not stay the investigation before the administrative law judge unless the administrative law judge or the Commission shall so order.

        § 210.25   Sanctions.

#### § § 210.25

        (a)(1) Any party may file a motion for sanctions for abuse of process under 210.4(d)(1), abuse of discovery under § 210.27(g)(3), failure to make or cooperate in discovery under § 210.33(b) or (c), or violation of a protective order under § 210.34(c). A motion alleging abuse of process should be filed promptly after the requirements of § 210.4(d)(1)(i) have been satisfied. A motion alleging abuse of discovery, failure to make or cooperate in discovery, or violation of a protective order should be filed promptly after the allegedly sanctionable conduct is discovered.

        (2) The administrative law judge (when the investigation or related proceeding is before the administrative law judge) or the Commission (when the investigation or related proceeding is before it) also may raise the sanctions issue sua sponte. (See also §§ 210.4(d)(1)(ii), 210.27(g)(3), 210.33(c), and 210.34(c).)

        (b) A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the presiding administrative law judge, if the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred and is discovered while the administrative law judge is presiding in an investigation or in a related proceeding. During an investigation, the administrative law judge's ruling on the motion shall be in the form of an order, if it is issued before or concurrently with the initial determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of the investigation. In a related proceeding, the administrative law judge's ruling shall be in the form of an order, regardless of the point in time at which the order is issued.

        (c) A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the Commission, if the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred while the Commission is presiding or is filed after the subject investigation or related proceeding is terminated. The Commission may assign the motion to an administrative law judge for issuance of a recommended determination. The deadlines and procedures that will be followed in processing the recommended determination will be set forth in the Commission order assigning the motion to an administrative law judge.

        (d) If an administrative law judge's order concerning sanctions is issued before the initial determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of the investigation, it may be appealed under § 210.24(b)(1) with leave from the administrative law judge, if the requirements of that section are satisfied. If the order is issued concurrently with the initial determination, the order may be appealed by filing a petition meeting the requirements of § 210.43(b). The periods for filing such petitions and responding to the petitions will be specified in the Commission notice issued pursuant to § 210.42(i), if the initial determination has granted a motion for termination of the investigation, or in the Commission notice issued pursuant to § 210.46(a), if the initial determination concerns violation of section 337. The Commission will determine whether to adopt the order after disposition of the initial determination concerning violation of section 337 or termination of the investigation.

        (e) If the administrative law judge's ruling on the motion for sanctions is in the form of a recommended determination pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the deadlines and procedures for parties to contest the recommended determination will be set forth in the Commission order assigning the motion to an administrative law judge.

        (f) If a motion for sanctions is filed with the administrative law judge during an investigation, he may defer his adjudication of the motion until after he has issued a final initial determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of investigation. If the administrative law judge defers his adjudication in such a manner, his ruling on the motion for sanctions must be in the form of a recommended determination and shall be issued no later than 30 days after issuance of the Commission's final determination on violation of section 337 or termination of the investigation. To aid the Commission in determining whether to adopt a recommended determination, any party may file written comments with the Commission 14 days after service of the recommended determination. Replies to such comments may be filed within seven days after service of the comments. The Commission will determine whether to adopt the recommended determination after reviewing the parties' arguments and taking any other steps the Commission deems appropriate.

        § 210.26   Other motions.

#### § § 210.26

        Motions pertaining to discovery shall be filed in accordance with § 210.15 and the pertinent provisions of subpart E of this part (§§ 210.27 through 210.34). Motions pertaining to evidentiary hearings and prehearing conferences shall be filed in accordance with § 210.15 and the pertinent provisions of subpart F of this part (§§ 210.35 through 210.40). Motions for temporary relief shall be filed as provided in subpart H of this part (see §§ 210.52 through 210.57).

      Subpart E—Discovery and Compulsory Process

        § 210.27   General provisions governing discovery.

#### § § 210.27

        (a)  The parties to an investigation may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property for inspection or other purposes; and requests for admissions.

        (b)  Regarding the scope of discovery for the temporary relief phase of an investigation, see § 210.61. For the permanent relief phase of an investigation, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the following:

        (1) The claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things;

        (2) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter;

        (3) The appropriate remedy for a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (see § 210.42(a)(1)(ii)(A)); or

        (4) The appropriate bond for the respondents, under section 337(j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, during Presidential review of the remedial order (if any) issued by the Commission (see § 210.42(a)(1)(ii)(B)).

        (c)  A person need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. The party seeking the discovery may file a motion to compel discovery pursuant to § 210.33(a). In response to the motion to compel discovery, or in a motion for a protective order filed pursuant to § 210.34, the person from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the administrative law judge may order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations found in paragraph (d) of this section. The administrative law judge may specify conditions for the discovery.

        (d)  In response to a motion made pursuant to §§ 210.33(a) or 210.34 or  the administrative law judge must limit by order the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed in this subpart if the administrative law judge determines that:

        (1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

        (2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the investigation;

        (3) The responding person has waived the legal position that justified the discovery or has stipulated to the particular facts pertaining to a disputed issue to which the discovery is directed; or

        (4) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the investigation, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues to be decided by the Commission, and matters of public concern.

        (e)  (1) When, in response to a discovery request made under this subpart, a person withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is privileged or subject to protection as attorney work product, the person must:

        (i) Expressly make the claim when responding to a relevant question or request; and

        (ii) Within 10 days of making the claim produce to the requester a privilege log that describes the nature of the information not produced or disclosed, in a manner that will enable the requester to assess the claim without revealing the information at issue. The privilege log must separately identify each withheld document, communication, or item, and to the extent possible must specify the following for each entry:

        (A) The date the information was created or communicated;

        (B) The author(s) or speaker(s);

        (C) All recipients;

        (D) The employer and position for each author, speaker, or recipient, including whether that person is an attorney or patent agent;

        (E) The general subject matter of the information; and

        (F) The type of privilege or protection claimed.

        (2) If a document produced in discovery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as attorney work product, the person making the claim may notify any person that received the document of the claim and the basis for it.

        (i) The notice shall identify the information in the document subject to the claim, preferably using a privilege log as defined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. After being notified, a person that received the document must do the following:

        (A) Within 7 days of service of the notice return, sequester, or destroy the specified document and any copies it has;

        (B) Not use or disclose the document until the claim is resolved; and

        (C) Within 7 days of service of the notice take reasonable steps to retrieve the document if the person disclosed it to others before being notified.

        (ii) Within 7 days of service of the notice, the claimant and the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to resolve the claim of privilege or protection. Within 5 days after the conference, a party may file a motion to compel the production of the document and may, in the motion to compel, use a description of the document from the notice produced under this paragraph. In connection with the motion to compel, the party may submit the document  for consideration by the administrative law judge. The person that produced the document must preserve the document until the claim of privilege or protection is resolved.

        (3) Parties may enter into a written agreement to waive compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section for documents, communications, and items created or communicated within a time period specified in the agreement. The administrative law judge may decline to entertain any motion based on information claimed to be subject to the agreement. If information claimed to be subject to the agreement is produced in discovery then the administrative law judge may determine that the produced information is not entitled to privilege or protection.

        (4) For good cause, the administrative law judge may order a different period of time for compliance with any requirement of this section. Parties may enter into a written agreement to set a different period of time for compliance with any requirement of this section without approval by the administrative law judge unless the administrative law judge has ordered a different period of time for compliance, in which case the parties' agreement must be approved by the administrative law judge.

        (5)(i) The provisions of § 210.27(e)(1) through (4) protect drafts of expert reports, regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.

        (ii) The provisions of § 210.27(e)(1) through (4) protect communications between the party's attorney and expert witnesses concerning trial preparation, regardless of the form of the communications, except to the extent that the communications:

        (A) Relate to compensation for the expert's study or testimony;

        (B) Identify facts or data that the party's attorney provided and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or

        (iii) Identify assumptions that the party's attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.

        (f)  (1) A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response is under a duty to supplement or correct the response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the administrative law judge or the Commission or in the following circumstances: A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.

        (2) A duty to supplement responses also may be imposed by agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to a hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.

        (g)  (1) The front page of every request for discovery or response or objection thereto shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the Commission, the title of the investigation or related proceeding, and the docket number or investigation number, if any, assigned to the investigation or related proceeding.

        (2) Every request for discovery or response or objection thereto made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign the request, response, or objection and shall state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, objection, or response is:

        (i) Consistent with § 210.5(a) (if applicable) and other relevant provisions of this chapter, and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;

        (ii) Not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and

        (iii) Not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.

        (3) If without substantial justification a request, response, or objection is certified in violation of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the administrative law judge or the Commission, upon motion or sua sponte under § 210.25 of this part, may impose an appropriate sanction upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the request, response, or objection was made, or both.

        (4) An appropriate sanction may include an order to pay to the other parties the amount of reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to the extent authorized by Rule 26(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.

        (5) Monetary sanctions may be imposed under this section to reimburse the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations. Monetary sanctions will not be imposed under this section to reimburse the Commission for attorney's fees.

        § 210.28   Depositions.

#### § § 210.28

        (a)  Following publication in the  of a Commission notice instituting the investigation, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination or written questions. The presiding administrative law judge will determine the permissible dates or deadlines for taking such depositions. Without stipulation of the parties, the complainants as a group may take a maximum of five fact depositions per respondent or no more than 20 fact depositions whichever is greater, the respondents as a group may take a maximum of 20 fact depositions total, and if the Commission investigative attorney is a party, he or she may take a maximum of 10 fact depositions and is permitted to participate in all depositions taken by any parties in the investigation. Each notice for a corporation to designate deponents only counts as one deposition and includes all corporate representatives so designated to respond, and related respondents are treated as one respondent for purposes of determining the number of depositions. The presiding administrative law judge may increase the number of depositions on written motion for good cause shown.

        (b)  Depositions may be taken before a person having power to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held.

        (c)  A party desiring to take the deposition of a person shall give notice in writing to every other party to the investigation. The administrative law judge shall determine the appropriate period for providing such notice. A party upon whom a notice of deposition is served may make objections to a notice of deposition and state the reasons therefor within ten days of service of the notice of deposition. The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs. A notice may provide for the taking of testimony by telephone, but the administrative law judge may, on motion of any party, require that the deposition be taken in the presence of the deponent. The parties may stipulate in writing, or the administrative law judge may upon motion order, that the testimony at a deposition be recorded by other than stenographic means. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to or included in the notice.

        (d)  Each deponent shall be duly sworn, and any adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections, except that privileged communications and subject matter need not be disclosed. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, together with all objections made, shall be reduced to writing, after which the deposition shall be subscribed by the deponent (unless the parties by stipulation waive signing or the deponent is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign) and certified by the person before whom the deposition was taken. If the deposition is not subscribed by the deponent, the person administering the oath shall state on the record such fact and the reason therefor. When a deposition is recorded by stenographic means, the stenographer shall certify on the transcript that the witness was sworn in the stenographer's presence and that the transcript is a true record of the testimony of the witness. When a deposition is recorded by other than stenographic means and is thereafter transcribed, the person transcribing it shall certify that the person heard the witness sworn on the recording and that the transcript is a correct writing of the recording. Thereafter, upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, that person shall furnish a copy of the transcript or other recording of the deposition to any party or to the deponent. See paragraph (i) of this section concerning the effect of errors and irregularities in depositions.

        (e)  A party desiring to take the deposition of an officer or employee of the Commission other than the Commission investigative attorney, or of an officer or employee of another Government agency, or to obtain documents or other physical exhibits in the custody, control, and possession of such officer or employee, shall proceed by written motion to the administrative law judge for leave to apply for a subpoena under § 210.32(c). Such a motion shall be granted only upon a showing that the information expected to be obtained thereby is within the scope of discovery permitted by § 210.27(b) or § 210.61 and cannot be obtained without undue hardship by alternative means.

        (f)  The party taking the deposition shall promptly serve one copy of the deposition transcript on the Commission investigative attorney.

        (g)  The fact that a deposition is taken and served upon the Commission investigative attorney as provided in this section does not constitute a determination that it is admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the investigation. Only such part of a deposition as is received in evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in such investigation upon which a determination may be based. Objections may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason that would require exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.

        (h)  A deposition may be used as evidence against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions:

        (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of a deponent as a witness;

        (2) The deposition of a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose;

        (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purposes if the administrative law judge finds—

        (i) That the witness is dead; or

        (ii) That the witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or

        (iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or

        (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or

        (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the oral testimony of witnesses at a hearing, to allow the deposition to be used; or

        (vi) Upon agreement of the parties and within the administrative law judge's discretion, the use of designated deposition testimony in lieu of live witness testimony absent the circumstances otherwise enumerated in this paragraph is permitted.

        (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part that ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.

        (i) —(1)  All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving notice.

        (2)  Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the person before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.

        (3)  (i) Objections to the competency of a witness or the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.

        (ii) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.

        (iii) Objections to the form of written questions submitted under this section are waived unless served in writing upon the party propounding them. The presiding administrative law judge shall set the deadline for service of such objections.

        (4)  Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, served, or otherwise dealt with by the person before whom it is taken are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.

        § 210.29   Interrogatories.

#### § § 210.29

        (a)  Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served. Interrogatories may relate to any matters that can be inquired into under § 210.27(b) or § 210.61, and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence. Absent stipulation of the parties, any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories not exceeding 175 in number including all discrete subparts. Related respondents are treated as one entity. The presiding administrative law judge may increase the number of interrogatories on written motion for good cause shown.

        (b)  (1) Interrogatories may be served upon any party after the date of publication in the  of the notice of investigation.

        (2) Parties answering interrogatories shall repeat the interrogatories being answered immediately preceding the answers. Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections are to be signed by the attorney making them. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections, if any, within ten days of service of the interrogatories or within the time specified by the administrative law judge. The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under § 210.33(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.

        (3) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the administrative law judge may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a prehearing conference or a later time.

        (c)  When the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such records, or from a compilation, abstract, or summary based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. The specifications provided shall include sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the documents from which the answer may be ascertained.

        § 210.30   Requests for production of documents and things and entry upon land.

#### § § 210.30

        (a)  Any party may serve on any other party a request:

        (1) To produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on his behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or

        (2) To permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of § 210.27(b).

        (b)  (1) The request may be served upon any party after the date of publication in the  of the notice of investigation. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts.

        (2) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 10 days or the time specified by the administrative law judge. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of any item or category, the part shall be specified. The party submitting the request may move for an order under § 210.33(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested. A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the request.

        (c)  This section does not preclude issuance of an order against a person not a party to permit entry upon land.

        § 210.31   Requests for admission.

#### § § 210.31

        (a)  Any party may serve on any other party a written request for admission of the truth of any matters relevant to the investigation and set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been otherwise furnished or are known to be, and in the request are stated as being, in the possession of the other party. Each matter as to which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The request may be served upon a party whose complaint is the basis for the investigation after the date of publication in the  of the notice of investigation. The administrative law judge will determine the period within which a party may serve a request upon other parties.

        (b)  A party answering a request for admission shall repeat the request for admission immediately preceding his answer. The matter may be deemed admitted unless, within 10 days or the period specified by the administrative law judge, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a sworn written answer or objection addressed to the matter. If objection is made, the reason therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter as to which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known to or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter as to which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for a hearing may not object to the request on that ground alone; he may deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.

        (c)  The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the objecting party sustains his burden of showing that the objection is justified, the administrative law judge shall order that an answer be served. If the administrative law judge determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this section, he may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The administrative law judge may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a prehearing conference or at a designated time prior to a hearing under this part.

        (d)  Any matter admitted under this section may be conclusively established unless the administrative law judge on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. The administrative law judge may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the issues of the investigation will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the administrative law judge that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his position on the issue of the investigation. Any admission made by a party under this section is for the purpose of the pending investigation and any related proceeding as defined in § 210.3 of this chapter.

        § 210.32   Subpoenas.

#### § § 210.32

        (a) —(1)  An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify at the taking of a deposition or at a hearing shall be made to the administrative law judge.

        (2)  An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify and to produce specified documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits at the taking of a deposition, at a prehearing conference, at a hearing, or under any other circumstances, shall be made in writing to the administrative law judge and shall specify the material to be produced as precisely as possible, showing the general relevancy of the material and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena.

        (3) The administrative law judge shall rule on all applications filed under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and may issue subpoenas when warranted.

        (b)  Subpoenas may be used by any party for purposes of discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, books or other physical exhibits for use in evidence, or for both purposes. When used for discovery purposes, a subpoena may require a person to produce and permit the inspection and copying of nonprivileged documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits that constitute or contain evidence relevant to the subject matter involved and that are in the possession, custody, or control of such person.

        (c) —(1)  An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring the production of nonparty documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Commission, or requiring the production of records or personnel of other Government agencies shall specify as precisely as possible the material to be produced, the nature of the information to be disclosed, or the expected testimony of the official or employee, and shall contain a statement showing the general relevancy of the material, information, or testimony and the reasonableness of the scope of the application, together with a showing that such material, information, or testimony or their substantial equivalent could not be obtained without undue hardship or by alternative means.

        (2)  Such applications shall be ruled upon by the administrative law judge, and he may issue such subpoenas when warranted. To the extent that the motion is granted, the administrative law judge shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of the official or employee as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.

        (3)  No application for a subpoena for production of documents grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) shall be entertained by the administrative law judge.

        (d)  (1) Any objection to a subpoena shall be served in writing on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena within the later of 10 days after receipt of the subpoena or within such time as the administrative law judge may allow. If an objection is made, the party that requested the subpoena may move for a request for judicial enforcement upon reasonable notice to other parties or as otherwise provided by the administrative law judge who issued the subpoena.

        (2) Any motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed within the later of 10 days after receipt of the subpoena or within such time as the administrative law judge may allow.

        (e)  Applications for the issuance of the subpoenas pursuant to the provisions of this section may be made ex parte, and, if so made, such applications and rulings thereon shall remain ex parte unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.

        (f) —(1)  Any person compelled to appear in person to depose or testify in response to a subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses with respect to proceedings in the courts of the United States; provided, that salaried employees of the United States summoned to depose or testify as to matters related to their public employment, irrespective of the party at whose instance they are summoned, shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Federal regulations.

        (2)  The fees and mileage referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be paid by the party at whose instance deponents or witnesses appear. Fees due under this paragraph shall be tendered no later than the date for compliance with the subpoena issued under this section. Failure to timely tender fees under this paragraph shall not invalidate any subpoena issued under this section.

        (g)  In order to obtain judicial enforcement of a subpoena issued under paragraphs (a)(3) or (c)(2) of this section, the administrative law judge shall certify to the Commission, on motion or sua sponte, a request for such enforcement. The request shall be accompanied by copies of relevant papers and a written report from the administrative law judge concerning the purpose, relevance, and reasonableness of the subpoena. If the request, relevant papers, or written report contain confidential business information, the administrative law judge shall certify nonconfidential copies along with the confidential versions. The Commission will subsequently issue a notice stating whether it has granted the request and authorized its Office of the General Counsel to seek such enforcement.

> [59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 73 FR 38233, July 7, 2008; 83 FR 21161, May 8, 2018]

        § 210.33   Failure to make or cooperate in discovery; sanctions.

#### § § 210.33

        (a)  A party may apply to the administrative law judge for an order compelling discovery upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby.

        (b)  If a party or an officer or agent of a party fails to comply with an order including, but not limited to, an order for the taking of a deposition or the production of documents, an order to answer interrogatories, an order issued pursuant to a request for admissions, or an order to comply with a subpoena, the administrative law judge, for the purpose of permitting resolution of relevant issues and disposition of the investigation without unnecessary delay despite the failure to comply, may take such action in regard thereto as is just, including, but not limited to the following:

        (1) Infer that the admission, testimony, documents, or other evidence would have been adverse to the party;

        (2) Rule that for the purposes of the investigation the matter or matters concerning the order or subpoena issued be taken as established adversely to the party;

        (3) Rule that the party may not introduce into evidence or otherwise rely upon testimony by the party, officer, or agent, or documents, or other material in support of his position in the investigation;

        (4) Rule that the party may not be heard to object to introduction and use of secondary evidence to show what the withheld admission, testimony, documents, or other evidence would have shown;

        (5) Rule that a motion or other submission by the party concerning the order or subpoena issued be stricken or rule by initial determination that a determination in the investigation be rendered against the party, or both; or

        (6) Order any other non-monetary sanction available under Rule 37(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Any such action may be taken by written or oral order issued in the course of the investigation or by inclusion in the initial determination of the administrative law judge. It shall be the duty of the parties to seek, and that of the administrative law judge to grant, such of the foregoing means of relief or other appropriate relief as may be sufficient to compensate for the lack of withheld testimony, documents, or other evidence. If, in the administrative law judge's opinion such relief would not be sufficient, the administrative law judge shall certify to the Commission a request that court enforcement of the subpoena or other discovery order be sought.

        (c)  (1) If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of the party or person designated to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the administrative law judge or the Commission may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just. In lieu of or in addition to taking action listed in paragraph (b) of this section and to the extent provided in Rule 37(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the administrative law judge or the Commission, upon motion or sua sponte under § 210.25, may require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the administrative law judge or the Commission finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.

        (2) Monetary sanctions may be imposed under this section to reimburse the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations. Monetary sanctions will not be imposed under this section to reimburse the Commission for attorney's fees.

        § 210.34   Protective orders; reporting requirement; sanctions and other actions.

#### § § 210.34

        (a)  Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought or by the administrative law judge on his own initiative, and for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may make any order that may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest or that justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:

        (1) That discovery not be had;

        (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;

        (3) That discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;

        (4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;

        (5) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the administrative law judge;

        (6) That a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order of the Commission or the administrative law judge;

        (7) That a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; and

        (8) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the Commission or the administrative law judge. If the motion for a protective order is denied, in whole or in part, the Commission or the administrative law judge may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The Commission also may, upon motion or sua sponte, issue protective orders or may continue or amend a protective order issued by the administrative law judge.

        (b)  If confidential business information submitted in accordance with the terms of a protective order is disclosed to any person other than in a manner authorized by the protective order, lost, or stolen, the party responsible for the disclosure, or subject to the loss or theft, must immediately bring all pertinent facts relating to such incident to the attention of the submitter of the information and the administrative law judge or the Commission, and, without prejudice to other rights and remedies of the submitter of the information, make every effort to prevent further mishandling of such information by the party or the recipient of such information.

        (c)  (1) The issue of whether sanctions should be imposed may be raised on a motion by a party, the administrative law judge's own motion, or the Commission's own initiative in accordance with § 210.25(a)(2). Parties, including the party that identifies an alleged breach or makes a motion for sanctions, and the Commission shall treat the identity of the alleged breacher as confidential business information unless the Commission issues a public sanction. The identity of the alleged breacher means the name of any individual against whom allegations are made. The Commission and the administrative law judge may permit the parties to file written submissions or present oral argument on the issues of the alleged violation of the protective order and sanctions.

        (2) If the breach occurs while the investigation is before an administrative law judge, any determination on sanctions of the type enumerated in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section shall be in the form of a recommended determination. The Commission may then consider both the recommended determination and any related orders in making a determination on sanctions. When the motion is addressed to the administrative law judge for sanctions of the type enumerated in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section, he shall grant or deny a motion by issuing an order.

        (3) Any individual who has agreed to be bound by the terms of a protective order issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and who is determined to have violated the terms of the protective order, may be subject to one or more of the following:

        (i) An official reprimand by the Commission;

        (ii) Disqualification from or limitation of further participation in a pending investigation;

        (iii) Temporary or permanent disqualification from practicing in any capacity before the Commission pursuant to § 201.15(a) of this chapter;

        (iv) Referral of the facts underlying the violation to the appropriate licensing authority in the jurisdiction in which the individual is licensed to practice;

        (v) Sanctions of the sort enumerated in § 210.33(b), or such other action as may be appropriate.

        (d)  Each person who is subject to a protective order issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall report in writing to the Commission immediately upon learning that confidential business information disclosed to him or her pursuant to the protective order is the subject of:

        (1) A subpoena;

        (2) A court or an administrative order (other than an order of a court reviewing a Commission decision);

        (3) A discovery request;

        (4) An agreement; or

        (5) Any other written request, if the request or order seeks disclosure, by him or any other person, of the subject confidential business information to a person who is not, or may not be, permitted access to that information pursuant to either a Commission protective order or § 210.5(b).

        (e)  After providing notice and an opportunity to comment, the Commission may impose a sanction upon any person who willfully fails to comply with paragraph (d) of this section, or it may take other action.

Only the persons identified in a protective order, persons identified in § 210.5(b), and court personnel concerned with judicial review shall have access to confidential information in the in camera record. The right of the administrative law judge and the Commission to disclose confidential data under a protective order (pursuant to § 210.34) to the extent necessary for the proper disposition of each proceeding is specifically reserved.

        (b)  (1) In a civil action involving parties that are also parties to a proceeding before the Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, at the request of a party to a civil action that is also a respondent in the proceeding before the Commission, the district court may stay, until the determination of the Commission becomes final, proceedings in the civil action with respect to any claim that involves the same issues involved in the proceeding before the Commission under certain conditions. If such a stay is ordered by the district court, after the determination of the Commission becomes final and the stay is dissolved, the Commission shall certify to the district court such portions of the record of its proceeding as the district court may request. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the in camera record may be transmitted to a district court and be admissible in a civil action, subject to such protective order as the district court determines necessary, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1659.

        (2) To facilitate timely compliance with any court order requiring the Commission to transmit all or part of the record of its section 337 proceedings to the court, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a party that requests the court to issue an order staying the civil action or an order dissolving the stay and directing the Commission to transmit all or part of the record to the court must file written notice of the issuance or dissolution of a stay with the Commission Secretary within 10 days of the issuance or dissolution of a stay by the district court.

        (c)  The administrative law judge shall have authority to order documents or oral testimony offered in evidence, whether admitted or rejected, to be placed in camera.

        (d)  In camera documents and testimony shall constitute a part of the confidential record of the Commission.

        (e)  In submitting proposed findings, briefs, or other papers, counsel for all parties shall make an attempt in good faith to refrain from disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony. This shall not preclude references in such proposed findings, briefs, or other papers to such documents or testimony including generalized statements based on their contents. To the extent that counsel consider it necessary to include specific details of in camera data in their presentations, such data shall be incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or other papers marked “Business Confidential,” which shall be placed in camera and become a part of the confidential record.

        § 210.43   Petitions for review of initial determinations on matters other than temporary relief.

#### § § 210.43

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any party to an investigation may request Commission review of an initial determination issued under § 210.42(a)(1) or (c), § 210.50(d)(3), § 210.70(c), or § 210.75(b)(3) by filing a petition with the Secretary. A petition for review of an initial determination issued under § 210.42(a)(1) must be filed within 12 days after service of the initial determination. A petition for review of an initial determination issued under § 210.42(a)(3) must be filed within five (5) business days after service of the initial determination. A petition for review of an initial determination issued under § 210.42(c) that terminates the investigation in its entirety on summary determination, or an initial determination issued under § 210.50(d)(3), § 210.70(c), or § 210.75(b)(3), must be filed within 10 days after service of the initial determination. Petitions for review of all other initial determinations under § 210.42(c) must be filed within five (5) business days after service of the initial determination. A petition for review of an initial determination issued under § 210.50(d)(3) or § 210.70(c) must be filed within 10 days after service of the initial determination.

        (2) A party may not petition for review of any issue as to which the party has been found to be in default. Similarly, a party or proposed respondent who did not file a response to the motion addressed in the initial determination may be deemed to have consented to the relief requested and may not petition for review of the issues raised in the motion.

        (b)  (1) A petition for review filed under this section shall identify the party seeking review and shall specify the issues upon which review of the initial determination is sought, and shall, with respect to each such issue, specify one or more of the following grounds upon which review is sought:

        (i) That a finding or conclusion of material fact is clearly erroneous;

        (ii) That a legal conclusion is erroneous, without governing precedent, rule or law, or constitutes an abuse of discretion; or

        (iii) That the determination is one affecting Commission policy.

        (2) The petition for review must set forth a concise statement of the facts material to the consideration of the stated issues, and must present a concise argument providing the reasons that review by the Commission is necessary or appropriate to resolve an important issue of fact, law, or policy. If a petition filed under this paragraph exceeds 50 pages in length, it must be accompanied by a summary of the petition not to exceed ten pages. Petitions for review may not exceed 100 pages in length, exclusive of the summary and any exhibits. Petitions for review may not incorporate statements, issues, or arguments by reference. Any issue not raised in a petition for review will be deemed to have been abandoned by the petitioning party and may be disregarded by the Commission in reviewing the initial determination (unless the Commission chooses to review the issue on its own initiative under § 210.44), and any argument not relied on in a petition for review will be deemed to have been abandoned and may be disregarded by the Commission.

        (3) Any petition designated by the petitioner as a “contingent” petition for review shall be deemed to be a petition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and shall be processed accordingly. In order to preserve an issue for review by the Commission or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that was decided adversely to a party, the issue must be raised in a petition for review, whether or not the Commission's determination on the ultimate issue, such as a violation of section 337, was decided adversely to the party.

        (4) A party's failure to file a petition for review of an initial determination shall constitute abandonment of all issues decided adversely to that party in the initial determination.

        (5)  All petitions for review of an initial determination shall be served on the other parties by messenger, overnight delivery, or equivalent means.

        (c)  Any party may file a response within eight (8) days after service of a petition of a final initial determination under § 210.42(a)(1), and within five (5) business days after service of all other types of petitions, except that a party who has been found to be in default may not file a response to any issue as to which the party has defaulted. If a response to a petition for review filed under this paragraph exceeds 50 pages in length, it must be accompanied by a summary of the response not to exceed ten pages. Responses to petitions for review may not exceed 100 pages in length, exclusive of the summary and any exhibits. Responses to petitions for review may not incorporate statements, issues, or arguments by reference. Any argument not relied on in a response will be deemed to have been abandoned and may be disregarded by the Commission.

        (d)  (1) The Commission shall decide whether to grant, in whole or in part, a petition for review of an initial determination filed pursuant to § 210.42(a)(2) or § 210.42(c), which grants a motion for summary determination that would terminate the investigation in its entirety if it becomes the final determination of the Commission, § 210.50(d)(3), or § 210.70(c) within 45 days after the service of the initial determination on the parties, or by such other time as the Commission may order. The Commission shall decide whether to grant, in whole or in part, a petition for review of an initial determination filed pursuant to § 210.42(a)(3) within 30 days after the service of the initial determination on the parties, or by such other time as the Commission may order. The Commission shall decide whether to grant, in whole or in part, a petition for review of an initial determination filed pursuant to § 210.42(c), except as noted above, within 30 days after the service of the initial determination on the parties, or by such other time as the Commission may order.

        (2) The Commission shall decide whether to grant a petition for review, based upon the petition and response thereto, without oral argument or further written submissions unless the Commission shall order otherwise. A petition will be granted and review will be ordered if it appears that an error or abuse of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is present or if the petition raises a policy matter connected with the initial determination, which the Commission thinks it necessary or appropriate to address.

        (3) The Commission shall grant a petition for review and order review of an initial determination or certain issues therein when at least one of the participating Commissioners votes for ordering review. In its notice, the Commission shall establish the scope of the review and the issues that will be considered and make provisions for filing of briefs and oral argument if deemed appropriate by the Commission.

A self-initiated Commission review of an initial determination will be ordered if it appears that an error or abuse of the kind described in § 210.43(b)(1) is present or the initial determination raises a policy matter which the Commission thinks is necessary or appropriate to address.

        § 210.45   Review of initial determinations on matters other than temporary relief.

#### § § 210.45

        (a)  In the event the Commission orders review of an initial determination pertaining to issues other than temporary relief, the parties may be requested to file briefs on the issues under review at a time and of a size and nature specified in the notice of review. The parties, within the time provided for filing the review briefs, may submit a written request for a hearing to present oral argument before the Commission, which the Commission in its discretion may grant or deny. The Commission shall grant the request when at least one of the participating Commissioners votes in favor of granting the request.

        (b)  Only the issues set forth in the notice of review, and all subsidiary issues therein, will be considered by the Commission.

        (c)  On review, the Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the initial determination of the administrative law judge. In addition, the Commission may take no position on specific issues or portions of the initial determination of the administrative law judge. The Commission also may make any findings or conclusions that in its judgment are proper based on the record in the proceeding.

The Commission will issue a notice setting deadlines for written submissions from the parties, other Federal agencies, and interested members of the public on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the respondents. In those submissions, the parties may assert their arguments concerning the recommended determination issued by the administrative law judge pursuant to § 210.42(a)(ii) on the issues of remedy and bonding by respondents.

        (b)  Commission action on an initial determination concerning temporary relief is governed by § 210.66.

Any petition filed under this section must be confined to new questions raised by the determination or action ordered to be taken thereunder and upon which the petitioner had no opportunity to submit arguments. Any party desiring to oppose such a petition shall file an answer thereto within five days after service of the petition upon such party.  Any party desiring to oppose such a petition shall file an answer thereto within five days after service of the petition upon such party. The Commission on its own initiative may order reconsideration of a Commission determination or any action ordered to be taken thereunder.

        (3) Determine the amount of the bond to be posted by a respondent pursuant to section 337(j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930 following the issuance of temporary or permanent relief under section 337(d), (e), (f), or (g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, taking into account the requirement of section 337(e) and (j)(3) that the amount of the bond be sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury.

        (4) Receive submissions from the parties, interested persons, and other Government agencies and departments with respect to the subject matter of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.

        (i) After a recommended determination on remedy is issued by the presiding administrative law judge, the parties may submit to the Commission, within 30 days from service of the recommended determination, information relating to the public interest, including any updates to the information supplied under §§ 210.8(b) and (c) and 210.14(f). Submissions by the parties in response to the recommended determination are limited to 5 pages, inclusive of attachments. This provision does not apply to the public. Dates for submissions from the public are announced in the .

        (ii) When the matter under consideration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is whether to grant some form of permanent relief, the submissions described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall be filed by the deadlines specified in the Commission notice issued pursuant to § 210.46(a).

        (iii) When the matter under consideration is whether to grant some form of temporary relief, such submissions shall be filed by the deadlines specified in § 210.67(b), unless the Commission orders otherwise.

        (iv) Any submission from a party shall be served upon the other parties in accordance with § 210.4(g). The parties' submissions, as well as any filed by interested persons or other agencies shall be available for public inspection in the Office of the Secretary. If a party, interested person, or agency files a confidential version of its submission, it shall file a public version of the submission no later than one business day after the deadline for filing the submission.

        (v) The Commission will consider motions for oral argument or, when necessary, a hearing with respect to the subject matter of this section, except that no hearing or oral argument will be permitted in connection with a motion for temporary relief.

        (b)(1) With respect to an administrative law judge's authorization to take evidence or other information and to hear arguments from the parties and other interested persons on the issues of appropriate Commission action, the public interest, and bonding by the respondents for purposes of an initial determination on temporary relief, see §§ 210.61, 210.62, and 210.66(a). For purposes of the recommended determination required by § 210.42(a)(1)(ii), an administrative law judge shall take evidence or other information and hear arguments from the parties and other interested persons on the issues of appropriate Commission action and bonding by the respondents upon order of the Commission. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, and except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an administrative law judge shall not take evidence on the issue of the public interest for purposes of the recommended determination under § 210.42(a)(1)(ii).

        (2) Regarding terminations by settlement agreement, consent order, or arbitration agreement under § 210.21 (b), (c) or (d), the parties may file statements regarding the impact of the proposed termination on the public interest, and the administrative law judge may hear argument, although no discovery may be compelled with respect to issues relating solely to the public interest. Thereafter, the administrative law judge shall consider and make appropriate findings in the initial determination regarding the effect of the proposed settlement on the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers.

        (c) No general exclusion from entry of articles shall be ordered under paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the Commission determines that—

        (1) Such exclusion is necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or

        (2) There is a pattern of violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.

        (d)  (1)(i) If one or more respondents posts a bond pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1337(e)(1) or 1337(j)(3), proceedings to determine whether a respondent's bond should be forfeited to a complainant in whole or part may be initiated upon the filing of a motion, addressed to the administrative law judge who last presided over the investigation, by a complainant within 90 days after the expiration of the period of Presidential review under 19 U.S.C. 1337(j), or if an appeal is taken from the determination of the Commission, within 30 days after the resolution of the appeal. If that administrative law judge is no longer employed by the Commission, the motion shall be addressed to the chief administrative law judge.

        (ii) A respondent may file a motion addressed to the administrative law judge who last presided over the investigation for the return of its bond within 90 days after the expiration of the Presidential review period under 19 U.S.C. 1337(j), or if an appeal is taken from the determination of the Commission, within 30 days after the resolution of the appeal. If that administrative law judge is no longer employed by the Commission, the motion shall be addressed to the chief administrative law judge.

        (2) Any nonmoving party may file a response to a motion filed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section within 15 days after filing of the motion, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.

        (3) A motion for forfeiture or return of a respondent's bond in whole or part will be adjudicated by the administrative law judge in an initial determination with a 45-day effective date, which shall be subject to review under the provisions of §§ 210.42 through 210.45. In determining whether to grant the motion, the administrative law judge and the Commission will be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (taking into account that the roles of the parties are reversed in this instance).

        (4) If the Commission determines that a respondent's bond should be forfeited to a complainant, and if the bond is being held by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commission Secretary shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the Commission's determination.

        § 210.51   Period for concluding investigation.

#### § § 210.51

        (a)  Within 45 days after institution of an original investigation on whether there is a violation of section 337, or an investigation which is a formal enforcement proceeding, the administrative law judge shall issue an order setting a target date for completion of the investigation. After the target date has been set, it can be modified by the administrative law judge for good cause shown before the investigation is certified to the Commission or by the Commission after the investigation is certified to the Commission.

        (1)  If the target date does not exceed 16 months from the date of institution of an original investigation, the order of the administrative law judge shall be final and not subject to interlocutory review. If the target date exceeds 16 months, the order of the administrative law judge shall constitute an initial determination. Any extension of the target date beyond 16 months, before the investigation is certified to the Commission, shall be by initial determination.

        (2)  If the target date does not exceed 12 months from the date of institution of the formal enforcement proceeding, the order of the administrative law judge shall be final and not subject to interlocutory review. If the target date exceeds 12 months, the order of the administrative law judge shall constitute an initial determination.

      Subpart H—Temporary Relief

        § 210.52   Motions for temporary relief.

#### § § 210.52

        Requests for temporary relief under section 337 (e) or (f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 shall be made through a motion filed in accordance with the following provisions:

        (a) A complaint requesting temporary relief shall be accompanied by a motion setting forth the complainant's request for such relief. In determining whether to grant temporary relief, the Commission will apply the standards the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit uses in determining whether to affirm lower court decisions granting preliminary injunctions. The motion for temporary relief accordingly must contain a detailed statement of specific facts bearing on the factors the Federal Circuit has stated that a U.S. District Court must consider in granting a preliminary injunction.

        (b) The motion must also contain a detailed statement of facts bearing on:

        (1) Whether the complainant should be required to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief; and

        (2) The appropriate amount of the bond, if the Commission determines that a bond will be required.

        (c) In determining whether to require a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief, the Commission will be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

        (d) The following documents and information also shall be filed along with the motion for temporary relief:

        (1) A memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion;

        (2) Affidavits executed by persons with knowledge of the facts asserted in the motion; and

        (3) All documents, information, and other evidence in complainant's possession that complainant intends to submit in support of the motion.

        (e) If the complaint, the motion for temporary relief, or the documentation supporting the motion for temporary relief contains confidential business information as defined in § 201.6(a) of this chapter, the complainant must follow the procedure outlined in §§ 210.4(a), 210.5(a), 201.6 (a) and (c), 210.8(a), and 210.55 of this part.

> [59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67629, Dec. 30, 1994; 60 FR 32444, June 22, 1995]

        § 210.53   Motion filed after complaint.

#### § § 210.53

        (a) A motion for temporary relief may be filed after the complaint, but must be filed prior to the Commission determination under § 210.10 on whether to institute an investigation. A motion filed after the complaint shall contain the information, documents, and evidence described in § 210.52 and must also make a showing that extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant temporary relief and that the moving party was not aware, and with due diligence could not have been aware, of those circumstances at the time the complaint was filed. When a motion for temporary relief is filed after the complaint but before the Commission has determined whether to institute an investigation based on the complaint, the 35-day period allotted under § 210.58 for review of the complaint and informal investigatory activity will begin to run anew from the date on which the motion was filed.

        (b) A motion for temporary relief may not be filed after an investigation has been instituted.

        § 210.54   Service of motion by the complainant.

#### § § 210.54

        Notwithstanding the provisions of § 210.11 regarding service of the complaint by the Commission upon institution of an investigation, on the day the complainant files a complaint and motion for temporary relief, if any, with the Commission (see § 210.8(a)(1) and (a)(2) of subpart B of this part), the complainant must serve non-confidential copies of both documents (as well as non-confidential copies of all materials or documents attached thereto) on all proposed respondents and on the embassy in Washington, DC of the country in which each proposed respondent is located as indicated in the Complaint. If a complainant files any supplemental information with the Commission prior to institution, nonconfidential copies of that supplemental information must be served on all proposed respondents and on the embassy in Washington, DC of the country in which each proposed respondent is located as indicated in the complaint. The complaint, motion, and supplemental information, if any, shall be served by messenger, overnight delivery, or equivalent means. A signed certificate of service must accompany the complaint and motion for temporary relief. If the certificate does not accompany the complaint and the motion, the Secretary shall not accept the complaint or the motion and shall promptly notify the submitter. Actual proof of service on each respondent and embassy (e.g., certified mail return receipts, messenger, or overnight delivery receipts, or other proof of delivery)—or proof of a serious but unsuccessful effort to make such service—must be filed within 10 days after the filing of the complaint and motion. If the requirements of this section are not satisfied, the Commission may extend its 35-day deadline under § 210.58 for determining whether to provisionally accept the motion for temporary relief and institute an investigation on the basis of the complaint.

        § 210.55   Content of service copies.

#### § § 210.55

        (a) Any purported confidential business information that is deleted from the nonconfidential service copies of the complaint and motion for temporary relief must satisfy the requirements of § 201.6(a) of this chapter (which defines confidential information for purposes of Commission proceedings). For attachments to the complaint or motion that are confidential in their entirety, the complainant must provide a nonconfidential summary of what each attachment contains. Despite the redaction of confidential material from the complaint and motion for temporary relief, the nonconfidential service copies must contain enough factual information about each element of the violation alleged in the complaint and the motion to enable each proposed respondent to comprehend the allegations against it.

        (b) If the Commission determines that the complaint, motion for temporary relief, or any exhibits or attachments thereto contain excessive designations of confidentiality that are not warranted under § 201.6(a) of this chapter, the Commission may require the complainant to file and serve new non-confidential versions of the aforesaid submissions in accordance with § 210.54 and may determine that the 35-day period under § 210.58 for deciding whether to institute an investigation and to provisionally accept the motion for temporary relief for further processing shall begin to run anew from the date the new non-confidential versions are filed with the Commission and served on the proposed respondents in accordance with § 210.54.

        § 210.56   Notice accompanying service copies.

#### § § 210.56

        (a) Each service copy of the complaint and motion for temporary relief shall be accompanied by a notice containing the following text:

        (b) In the event that the complaint and motion for temporary relief are filed after the date specified in the above notice, the complainant must serve a supplementary notice to all proposed respondents and embassies stating the correct filing date. The supplementary notice shall be served by messenger, overnight delivery, or equivalent means. The complainant shall file a certificate of service and a copy of the supplementary notice with the Commission.

        § 210.57   Amendment of the motion.

#### § § 210.57

        A motion for temporary relief may be amended at any time prior to the institution of an investigation. All material filed to amend the motion (or the complaint) must be served on all proposed respondents and on the embassies in Washington, DC, of the foreign governments that they represent, in accordance with § 210.54. If the amendment expands the scope of the motion or changes the complainant's assertions on the issue of whether a bond is to be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief or the appropriate amount of the bond, the 35-day period under § 210.58 for determining whether to institute an investigation and provisionally accept the motion for temporary relief shall begin to run anew from the date the amendment is filed with the Commission. A motion for temporary relief may not be amended to expand the scope of the temporary relief inquiry after an investigation is instituted.

        § 210.58   Provisional acceptance of the motion.

#### § § 210.58

        The Commission shall determine whether to accept a motion for temporary relief at the same time it determines whether to institute an investigation on the basis of the complaint. That determination shall be made within 35 days after the complaint and motion for temporary relief are filed, unless the 35-day period is restarted pursuant to § 210.53(a), § 210.54, § 210.55, or § 210.57, or exceptional circumstances exist which preclude adherence to the prescribed deadline. (See § 210.10(a)(1).) Before the Commission determines whether to provisionally accept a motion for temporary relief, the motion will be examined for sufficiency and compliance with §§ 210.52, 210.53(a) (if applicable), 210.54 through 210.56, as well as §§ 210.4 and 210.5. The motion will be subject to the same type of preliminary investigatory activity as the complaint. (See § 210.9(b).) Acceptance of a motion pursuant to this paragraph constitutes provisional acceptance for referral of the motion to the chief administrative law judge, who will assign the motion to a presiding administrative law judge for issuance of an initial determination under § 210.66(a). Commission rejection of an insufficient or improperly filed complaint will preclude acceptance of a motion for temporary relief. Commission rejection of a motion for temporary relief will not preclude institution of an investigation of the complaint.

        § 210.59   Responses to the motion and the complaint.

#### § § 210.59

        (a) Any party may file a response to a motion for temporary relief. Unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, a response to a motion for temporary relief in an ordinary investigation must be filed not later than 10 days after service of the motion by the Commission. In a “more complicated” investigation, the response shall be due within 20 days after such service, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding administrative law judge.

        (b) The response must comply with the requirements of §§ 210.4 and 210.5 of this part, and shall contain the following information:

        (1) A statement that sets forth with particularity any objection to the motion for temporary relief;

        (2) A statement of specific facts concerning the factors the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would consider in determining whether to affirm lower court decisions granting or denying preliminary injunctions;

        (3) A memorandum of points and authorities in support of the respondent's response to the motion;

        (4) Affidavits, where possible, executed by persons with knowledge of the facts specified in the response. Each response to the motion must address, to the extent possible, the complainant's assertions regarding whether a bond should be required and the appropriate amount of the bond. Responses to the motion for temporary relief also may contain counter-proposals concerning the amount of the bond or the manner in which the bond amount should be calculated.

        (c) Each response to the motion for temporary relief must also be accompanied by a response to the complaint and notice of investigation. Responses to the complaint and notice of investigation must comply with §§ 210.4 and 210.5 of this part, and any protective order issued by the administrative law judge under § 210.34 of this part.

        § 210.60   Designating the temporary relief phase of an investigation more complicated for the purpose of adjudicating a motion for temporary relief.

#### § § 210.60

        (a) At the time the Commission determines to institute an investigation and provisionally accepts a motion for temporary relief pursuant to § 210.58, or at any time thereafter, the Commission may designate the temporary relief phase of an investigation “more complicated” pursuant to § 210.60(b) for the purpose of obtaining up to 60 additional days to adjudicate the motion for temporary relief. In the alternative, after the motion for temporary relief is referred to the administrative law judge for an initial determination under § 210.66(a), the administrative law judge may issue an order, sua sponte or on motion, designating the temporary relief phase of the investigation “more complicated” for the purpose of obtaining additional time to adjudicate the motion for temporary relief. Such order shall constitute a final determination of the Commission, and notice of the order shall be published in the  As required by section 337(e)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the notice shall state the reasons that the temporary relief phase of the investigation was designated “more complicated.” The “more complicated” designation may be conferred by the Commission or the presiding administrative law judge pursuant to this paragraph on the basis of the complexity of the issues raised in the motion for temporary relief or the responses thereto, or for other good cause shown.

        (b) A temporary relief phase is designated more complicated owing to the subject matter, difficulty in obtaining information, the large number of parties involved, or other significant factors.

        § 210.61   Discovery and compulsory process.

#### § § 210.61

        The presiding administrative law judge shall set all discovery deadlines. The administrative law judge's authority to compel discovery includes discovery relating to the following issues:

        (a) Any matter relevant to the motion for temporary relief and the responses thereto, including the issues of bonding by the complainant; and

        (b) The issues the Commission considers pursuant to sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, viz.,

        (1) The appropriate form of relief (notwithstanding the form requested in the motion for temporary relief),

        (2) Whether the public interest precludes that form of relief, and

        (3) The amount of the bond to be posted by the respondents to secure importations or sales of the subject imported merchandise while the temporary relief order is in effect. The administrative law judge may, but is not required to, make findings on the issues specified in sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), or (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930. Evidence and information obtained through discovery on those issues will be used by the parties and considered by the Commission in the context of the parties' written submissions on remedy, the public interest, and bonding by respondents, which are filed with the Commission pursuant to § 210.67(b).

        § 210.62   Evidentiary hearing.

#### § § 210.62

        An opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and § 210.36 of this part will be provided in connection with every motion for temporary relief. If a hearing is conducted, the presiding administrative law judge may, but is not required to, take evidence concerning the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by respondents under section 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930.

        § 210.63   Proposed findings and conclusions and briefs.

#### § § 210.63

        The administrative law judge shall determine whether and, if so, to what extent the parties shall be permitted to file proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law, or briefs under § 210.40 concerning the issues involved in adjudication of the motion for temporary relief.

        § 210.64   Interlocutory appeals.

#### § § 210.64

        There will be no interlocutory appeals to the Commission under § 210.24 on any matter connected with a motion for temporary relief that is decided by an administrative law judge prior to the issuance of the initial determination on the motion for temporary relief.

        § 210.65   Certification of the record.

#### § § 210.65

        When the administrative law judge issues an initial determination concerning temporary relief pursuant to § 210.66(a), he shall also certify to the Commission the record upon which the initial determination is based.

        § 210.66   Initial determination concerning temporary relief; Commission action thereon.

#### § § 210.66

        (a) On or before the 70th day after publication of the notice of investigation in an ordinary investigation, or on or before the 120th day after such publication in a “more complicated” investigation, the administrative law judge will issue an initial determination concerning the issues listed in §§ 210.52 and 210.59. If the 70th day or the 120th day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the initial determination must be received in the Office of the Secretary no later than 12:00 noon on the first business day after the 70-day or 120-day deadline. The initial determination may, but is not required to, address the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the respondents pursuant under sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930.

        (b) If the initial determination on temporary relief is issued on the 70-day or 120-day deadline imposed in paragraph (a) of this section, the initial determination will become the Commission's determination 20 calendar days after issuance thereof in an ordinary case, and 30 calendar days after issuance in a “more complicated” investigation, unless the Commission modifies, reverses, or sets aside the initial determination in whole or part within that period. If the initial determination on temporary relief is issued before the 70-day or 120-day deadline imposed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will add the extra time to the 20-day or 30-day deadline to which it would otherwise have been held. In computing the deadlines imposed by this paragraph, intermediary Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays shall be included. If the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday as defined in § 201.14(a) of this chapter, the effective date of the initial determination shall be extended to the next business day.

        (c) The Commission will not modify, reverse, or set aside an initial determination concerning temporary relief unless the Commission finds that a finding of material fact is clearly erroneous, that the initial determination contains an error of law, or that there is a policy matter warranting discussion by the Commission. All parties may file written comments concerning any clear error of material fact, error of law, or policy matter warranting such action by the Commission. Such comments must be limited to 35 pages in an ordinary investigation and 45 pages in a “more complicated” investigation. The comments must be filed no later than seven calendar days after issuance of the initial determination in an ordinary case and 10 calendar days after issuance of the initial determination in a “more complicated” investigation. In computing the aforesaid 7-day and 10-day deadlines, intermediary Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays shall be included. If the initial determination is issued on a Friday, however, the filing deadline for comments shall be measured from the first business day after issuance. If the last day of the filing period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday as defined in § 201.14(a) of this chapter, the filing deadline shall be extended to the next business day. The parties shall serve their comments on other parties by messenger, overnight delivery, or equivalent means.

        (d) Notice of the initial determination shall be served on the other agencies listed in § 210.50(a)(2). Those agencies will be given 10 calendar days from the date of service of the notice to file comments on the initial determination.

        (e)(1) Each party may file a response to each set of comments filed by another party. All such reply comments must be filed within 10 calendar days after issuance of the initial determination in an ordinary case and within 14 calendar days after issuance of an initial determination in a “more complicated” investigation. The deadlines for filing reply comments shall be computed in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, except that in no case shall a party have fewer than two calendar days to file reply comments.

        (2) Each set of reply comments will be limited to 20 pages in an ordinary investigation and 30 pages in a “more complicated” case.

        (f) If the Commission determines to modify, reverse, or set aside the initial determination, the Commission will issue a notice and, if appropriate, a Commission opinion. If the Commission does not modify, reverse, or set aside the administrative law judge's initial determination within the time provided under paragraph (b) of this section, the initial determination will automatically become the determination of the Commission. Notice of the Commission's determination concerning the initial determination will be issued on the statutory deadline for determining whether to grant temporary relief, or as soon as possible thereafter, and will be served on the parties. Notice of the determination will be published in the  if the Commission's disposition of the initial determination has resulted in a determination that there is reason to believe that section 337 has been violated and a temporary remedial order is to be issued. If the Commission determines (either by reversing or modifying the administrative law judge's initial determination, or by adopting the initial determination) that the complainant must post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief, the Commission may issue a supplemental notice setting forth conditions for the bond if any (in addition to those outlined in the initial determination) and the deadline for filing the bond with the Commission.

        § 210.67   Remedy, the public interest, and bonding.

#### § § 210.67

        The procedure for arriving at the Commission's determination of the issues of the appropriate form of temporary relief, whether the public interest factors enumerated in the statute preclude such relief, and the amount of the bond under which respondents' merchandise will be permitted to enter the United States during the pendency of any temporary relief order issued by the Commission, is as follows:

        (a) While the motion for temporary relief is before the administrative law judge, he may compel discovery on matters relating to remedy, the public interest and bonding (as provided in § 210.61). The administrative law judge also is authorized to make findings pertaining to the public interest, as provided in § 210.66(a). Such findings may be superseded, however, by Commission findings on that issue as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) On the 65th day after institution in an ordinary case or on the 110th day after institution in a “more complicated” investigation, all parties shall file written submissions with the Commission addressing those issues. The submissions shall refer to information and evidence already on the record, but additional information and evidence germane to the issues of appropriate relief, the statutory public interest factors, and bonding by respondents may be provided along with the parties' submissions. Pursuant to § 210.50(a)(4), interested persons may also file written comments, on the aforesaid dates, concerning the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the respondents.

        (c) On or before the 90-day or 150-day statutory deadline for determining whether to order temporary relief under section 337 (e)(1) and/or (f)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the Commission will determine what relief is appropriate in light of any violation that appears to exist, whether the public interest factors enumerated in the statute preclude the issuance of such relief, and the amount of the bond under which the respondents' merchandise will be permitted to enter the United States during the pendency of any temporary relief order issued by the Commission. In the event that Commission's findings on the public interest pursuant to this paragraph are inconsistent with findings made by the administrative law judge in the initial determination pursuant to § 210.66(a), the Commission's findings are controlling.

        § 210.68   Complainant's temporary relief bond.

#### § § 210.68

        (a) In every investigation under this part involving a motion for temporary relief, the question of whether the complainant shall be required to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of such relief shall be addressed by the parties, the presiding administrative law judge, and the Commission in the manner described in §§ 210.52, 210.59, 210.61, 210.62, and 210.66. If the Commission determines that a bond should be required, the bond may consist of one or more of the following:

        (1) The surety bond of a surety or guarantee corporation that is licensed to do business with the United States in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304-9306 and 31 CFR parts 223 and 224;

        (2) The surety bond of an individual, a trust, an estate, or a partnership, or a corporation, whose solvency and financial responsibility will be investigated and verified by the Commission; or

        (3) A certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other Government obligation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9301 and 31 CFR part 225, which is owned by the complainant and tendered in lieu of a surety bond, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9303(c) and 31 CFR part 225.

        (b) The bond and accompanying documentation must be submitted to the Commission within the time specified in the Commission notice, order, determination, or opinion requiring the posting of a bond, or within such other time as the Commission may order. If the bond is not submitted within the specified period (and an extension of time has not been granted), temporary relief will not be issued.

        (c) The corporate or individual surety on a bond or the person posting a certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other Government obligation in lieu of a surety bond must provide the following information on the face of the bond or in the instrument authorizing the Government to collect or sell the bond, certified check, bank draft, post office money order, cash, United States bond, Treasury note, or other Government obligation in response to a Commission order requiring forfeiture of the bond pursuant to § 210.70:

        (1) The investigation caption and docket number;

        (2) The names, addresses, and seals (if appropriate) of the principal, the surety, the obligee, as well as the “attorney in fact” and the registered process agent (if applicable) (see Customs Service regulations in 19 CFR part 113 and Treasury Department regulations in 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225);

        (3) The terms and conditions of the bond obligation, including the reason the bond is being posted, the amount of the bond, the effective date and duration of the bond (as prescribed by the Commission order, notice, determination, or opinion requiring the complainant to post a bond); and

        (4) A section at the bottom of the bond or other instrument for the date and authorized signature of the Secretary to reflect Commission approval of the bond.

        (d) Complainants who wish to post a certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other Government obligation in lieu of a surety bond must notify the Commission in writing immediately upon receipt of the Commission document requiring the posting of a bond, and must contact the Secretary to make arrangements for Commission receipt, handling, management, and deposit of the certified check, bank draft, post office money order, cash, United States bond, Treasury note, or other Government obligation tendered in lieu of a surety bond, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 9303, 31 CFR parts 202, 206, and 225 and other governing Treasury regulations and circular(s). If required by the governing Treasury regulations and circular, a certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other government obligation tendered in lieu of a surety bond may have to be collateralized. See, e.g., 31 CFR 202.6 and the appropriate Treasury Circular.

        § 210.69   Approval of complainant's temporary relief bond.

#### § § 210.69

        (a) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 9304(b), all bonds posted by complainants must be approved by the Commission before the temporary relief sought by the complainant will be issued. See also 31 U.S.C. § 9303(a) and 31 CFR 225.1 and 225.20. The Commission's bond approval officer for purposes of those provisions shall be the Secretary.

        (b) The bond approval process may entail investigation by the Secretary or the Commission's Office of Investigations to determine the veracity of all factual information set forth in the bond and the accompanying documentation (e.g., powers of attorney), as well as any additional verification required by 31 CFR parts 223, 224, or 225. The Secretary may reject a bond on one or more of the following grounds:

        (1) Failure to comply with the instructions in the Commission determination, order, or notice directing the complainant to post a bond;

        (2) Failure of the surety or the bond to provide information or supporting documentation required by the Commission, the Secretary, § 210.68 of this part, 31 CFR parts 223 or 224, or other governing statutes, regulations, or Treasury circulars, or because of a limitation prescribed in a governing statute, regulation, or circular;

        (3) Failure of an individual surety to execute and file with the bond, an affidavit of the type shown in appendix A to § 210.68, which sets forth information about the surety's assets, liabilities, net worth, real estate and other property of which the initial surety is the sole owner, other bonds on which the individual surety is a surety (and which must be updated at 4-month intervals while the bond is in effect, measured from the date on which the bond is approved by the Secretary on behalf of the Commission or by the Commission);

        (4) Any question about the solvency or financial responsibility of the surety, or any question of fraud, misrepresentation, or perjury which comes to light as a result of the verification inquiry during the bond approval process; and

        (5) Any other reason deemed appropriate by the Secretary.

        (c) If the complainant believes that the Secretary's rejection of the bond was erroneous as a matter of law, the complainant may appeal the Secretary's rejection of the bond by filing a petition with the Commission in the form of a letter to the Chairman, within 10 days after service of the rejection letter.

        (d) After the bond is approved and temporary relief is issued, if any question concerning the continued solvency of the individual or the legality or enforceability of the bond or undertaking develops, the Commission may take the following action(s), sua sponte or on motion;

        (1) Revoke the Commission approval of the bond and require complainant to post a new bond; or

        (2) Revoke or vacate the temporary remedial order for public interest reasons or changed conditions of law or fact (criteria that are the basis for modification or rescission of final Commission action pursuant to § 210.76(a)(1) and (b)); or

        (3) Notify the Treasury Department if the problem involves a corporate surety licensed to do business with the United States under 31 U.S.C. §§ 9303-9306 and 31 CFR parts 223 and 224; or

        (4) Refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice if there is a suggestion of fraud, perjury, or related conduct.

        § 210.70   Forfeiture or return of complainant's temporary relief bond.

#### § § 210.70

        (a)(1) If the Commission determines that one or more of the respondents whose merchandise was covered by the temporary relief order has not violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to the extent alleged in the motion for temporary relief and provided for in the temporary relief order, proceedings to determine whether the complainant's bond should be forfeited to one or more respondents in whole or part may be initiated upon the filing of a motion by a respondent within 30 days after filing of the aforesaid Commission determination on violation.

        (2) A complainant may file a motion for the return of its bond.

        (b) Any nonmoving party may file a response to a motion filed under paragraph (a) of this section within 15 days after filing of the motion, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.

        (c) A motion for forfeiture or return of a complainant's temporary relief bond in whole or part will be adjudicated by the administrative law judge in an initial determination with a 45-day effective date, which shall be subject to review under the provisions of §§ 210.42 through 210.45. In determining whether to grant the motion, the administrative law judge and the Commission will be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

      Subpart I—Enforcement Procedures and Advisory Opinions

        § 210.71   Information gathering.

#### § § 210.71

        (a)  (1) Whenever the Commission issues an exclusion order, the Commission may require any person to report facts available to that person that will help the Commission assist the U.S. Customs Service in determining whether and to what extent there is compliance with the order. Similarly, whenever the Commission issues a cease and desist order or a consent order, it may require any person to report facts available to that person that will aid the Commission in determining whether and to what extent there is compliance with the order or whether and to what extent the conditions that led to the order are changed.

        (2) The Commission may also include provisions that exercise any other information-gathering power available to the Commission by law, regardless of whether the order at issue is an exclusion order, a cease and desist order, or a consent order. The Commission may at any time request the cooperation of any person or agency in supplying it with information that will aid the Commission or the U.S. Customs Service in making the determinations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (b)  Reports under paragraph (a) of this section are to be in writing, under oath, and in such detail and in such form as the Commission prescribes.

        (c)  Terms and conditions of exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and consent orders for reporting and information gathering shall be enforceable by the Commission by a civil action under 19 U.S.C. 1333, or, at the Commission's discretion, in the same manner as any other provision of the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order is enforced.

        (d)  An exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order may provide for the frequency of reporting or information gathering and the date on which these activities are to terminate. If no date for termination is provided, reporting and information gathering shall terminate when the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order or any amendment to it expires by its own terms or is terminated.

        § 210.72   Confidentiality of information.

#### § § 210.72

        Confidential information (as defined in § 201.6(a) of this chapter) that is provided to the Commission pursuant to exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order will be received by the Commission in confidence. Requests for confidential treatment shall comply with § 201.6 of this chapter. The restrictions on disclosure and the procedures for handling such information (which are set out in §§ 210.5 and 210.39) shall apply and, in a proceeding under § 210.75 or § 210.76, the Commission or the presiding administrative law judge may, upon motion or sua sponte, issue or continue appropriate protective orders.

        § 210.73   Review of reports.

#### § § 210.73

        (a)  The Commission, through the Office of Unfair Import Investigations, will review reports submitted pursuant to any exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order and conduct such further investigation as it deems necessary to insure compliance with its orders.

        (b)  The Director of the Office of Unfair Import Investigations may, for good cause shown, extend the time in which reports required by exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and consent orders may be filed. An extension of time within which a report may be filed, or the filing of a report that does not evidence full compliance with the order, does not in any circumstances suspend or relieve a respondent from its obligation under the law with respect to compliance with such order.

        § 210.74   Modification of reporting requirements.

#### § § 210.74

        (a)  The Commission may modify reporting requirements of exclusion and cease and desist orders as necessary:

        (1) To help the Commission assist the U.S. Customs Service in ascertaining that there has been compliance with an outstanding exclusion order;

        (2) To help the Commission ascertain that there has been compliance with a cease and desist order;

        (3) To take account of changed circumstances; or

        (4) To minimize the burden of reporting or informational access.

        (b)  Consistent with the standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may modify reporting requirements of consent orders. The Commission shall serve notice of any proposed change, together with the reporting requirements to be modified and the reasons therefor, on each party subject to the consent order. Such parties shall be given the opportunity to submit briefs to the Commission, and the Commission may hold a hearing on the matter. Notice of any proposed change in the reporting requirements will be published in the  if the Commission determines to solicit public comment on the proposed change.

        § 210.75   Proceedings to enforce exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, consent orders, and other Commission orders.

#### § § 210.75

        (a)  (1) The Commission may institute an enforcement proceeding at the Commission level upon the filing by the complainant in the original investigation or his successor in interest, by the Office of Unfair Import Investigations, or by the Commission of a complaint setting forth alleged violations of any exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order. If a proceeding is instituted, the complaint shall be served upon the alleged violator and a notice of institution published in the  Within 15 days after the date of service of such a complaint, the named respondent shall file a response to it. Responses shall fully advise the Commission as to the nature of any defense and shall admit or deny each allegation of the complaint specifically and in detail unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case its answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as a denial. Allegations of fact not denied or controverted may be deemed admitted. Matters alleged as affirmative defenses shall be separately stated and numbered. These proceedings are authorized under section 337(b) as investigations on whether there is a violation of section 337 in the same manner as original investigations, and are conducted in accordance with the laws for original investigations as set forth in section 1337 of title 19 and sections 554, 555, 556, 557, and 702 of title 5 of the United States Code and the rules of this part.

        (i) The determination of whether to institute shall be made within 30 days after the complaint is filed, unless—

        (A) Exceptional circumstances preclude adherence to a 30-day deadline;

        (B) The filing party requests that the Commission postpone the determination on whether to institute an investigation; or

        (C) The filing party withdraws the complaint.

        (ii) If exceptional circumstances preclude Commission adherence to the 30-day deadline for determining whether to institute an investigation on the basis of the complaint, the determination will be made as soon after that deadline as possible.

        (iii) If the filing party desires to have the Commission postpone making a determination on whether to institute an investigation in response to the complaint, the filing party must file a written request with the Secretary. If the request is granted, the determination will be rescheduled for whatever date is appropriate in light of the facts.

        (iv) The filing party may withdraw the complaint as a matter of right at any time before the Commission votes on whether to institute an enforcement proceeding. To effect such withdrawal, the filing party must file a written notice with the Commission.

        (2) Upon the failure of a respondent to file and serve a response within the time and in the manner prescribed herein the Commission, in its discretion, may find the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and take such action as may be appropriate without notice or hearing, or, in its discretion, proceed without notice to take evidence on the allegations set forth in the complaint, provided that the Commission (or administrative law judge, if one is appointed) may permit late filings of an answer for good cause shown.

        (3) The Commission, in the course of a formal enforcement proceeding under this section, may hold a public hearing and afford the parties to the enforcement proceeding the opportunity to appear and be heard. The Commission may delegate the hearing to the chief administrative law judge for designation of a presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify an initial determination to the Commission. A presiding administrative law judge shall certify the record and issue the enforcement initial determination to the Commission no later than three months before the target date for completion of a formal enforcement proceeding. Parties may file petitions for review, and responses thereto, in accordance with § 210.43 of this part. The enforcement initial determination shall become the determination of the Commission 45 days after the date of service of the enforcement initial determination, unless the Commission, within 45 days after the date of such service, shall have ordered review of the enforcement initial determination on certain issues therein, or by order shall have changed the effective date of the enforcement initial determination.

        (4) Upon conclusion of a formal enforcement proceeding under this section, the Commission may:

        (i) Modify a cease and desist order, consent order, and/or exclusion order in any manner necessary to prevent the unfair practices that were originally the basis for issuing such order;

        (ii) Bring civil actions in a United States district court pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section (and section 337(f)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930) to recover for the United States the civil penalty accruing to the United States under that section for the breach of a cease and desist order or a consent order, and to obtain a mandatory injunction incorporating the relief the Commission deems appropriate for enforcement of the cease and desist order or consent order; or

        (iii) Revoke the cease and desist order or consent order and direct that the articles concerned be excluded from entry into the United States.

        (iv) Issue a new cease and desist order as necessary to prevent the unfair practices that were the basis for originally issuing the cease and desist order, consent order, and/or exclusion order subject to the enforcement proceeding.

        (5) Prior to effecting any issuance, modification, revocation, or exclusion under this section, the Commission shall consider the effect of such action upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers.

        (6) In lieu of or in addition to taking the action provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may issue, pursuant to section 337(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, an order providing that any article imported in violation of the provisions of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and an outstanding final exclusion order issued pursuant to section 337(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 be seized and forfeited to the United States, if the following conditions are satisfied:

        (i) The owner, importer, or consignee of the article (or the agent of such person) previously attempted to import the article into the United States;

        (ii) The article previously was denied entry into the United States by reason of a final exclusion order; and

        (iii) Upon such previous denial of entry, the Secretary of the Treasury provided the owner, importer, or consignee of the article (or the agent of such person) with written notice of the aforesaid exclusion order and the fact that seizure and forfeiture would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States.

        (b)  To obtain judicial enforcement of an exclusion order, a cease and desist order, a consent order, or a sanctions order, the Commission may initiate a civil action in the U.S. district court. In a civil action under section 337(f)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the Commission may seek to recover for the United States the civil penalty accruing to the United States under that section for the breach of a cease and desist order or a consent order, and may ask the court to issue a mandatory injunction incorporating the relief the Commission deems appropriate for enforcement of the cease and desist order or consent order. The Commission may initiate a proceeding to obtain judicial enforcement without any other type of proceeding otherwise available under section 337 or this subpart or without prior notice to any person, except as required by the court in which the civil action is initiated.

        § 210.76   Modification or rescission of exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, consent orders, and seizure and forfeiture orders.

#### § § 210.76

        (a)  (1) Whenever any person believes that changed conditions of fact or law, or the public interest, require that an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, such person may request, pursuant to section 337(k)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, that the Commission make a determination that the conditions which led to the issuance of an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order no longer exist. The Commission may also on its own initiative consider such action. The request shall state the changes desired and the changed circumstances or public interest warranting such action, shall include materials and argument in support thereof, and shall be served on all parties to the investigation in which the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order was issued. Any person may file an opposition to the petition within 10 days of service of the petition. If the Commission makes such a determination, it shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Custom and Border Protection.

        (2) If the petitioner previously has been found by the Commission to be in violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and if its petition requests a Commission determination that the petitioner is no longer in violation of that section or requests modification or rescission of an order issued pursuant to section 337 (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the burden of proof in any proceeding initiated in response to the petition pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be on the petitioner. In accordance with section 337(k)(2) of the Tariff Act, relief may be granted by the Commission with respect to such petition on the basis of new evidence or evidence that could not have been presented at the prior proceeding or on grounds that would permit relief from a judgment or order under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

        (3) If the petition requests modification or rescission of an order issued pursuant to section 337(d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a licensing or other settlement agreement, the petition shall contain copies of the licensing or other settlement agreements, any supplemental agreements, any documents referenced in the petition or attached agreements, and a statement that there are no other agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties concerning the subject matter of the investigation. If the licensing or other settlement agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning of § 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion. On motion for good cause shown, the administrative law judge or the Commission may limit the service of the agreements to the settling parties and the Commission investigative attorney.

        (b)  The Commission may thereafter institute a proceeding to modify or rescind the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order by issuing a notice. The Commission may hold a public hearing and afford interested persons the opportunity to appear and be heard. After consideration of the petition, any responses thereto, and any information placed on the record at a public hearing or otherwise, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate. The Commission may delegate any hearing under this section to the chief administrative law judge for designation of a presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify a recommended determination to the Commission.

        (1) The determination of whether to institute shall be made within 30 days after the petition is filed, unless—

        (i) Exceptional circumstances preclude adherence to a 30-day deadline;

        (ii) The petitioner requests that the Commission postpone the determination on whether to institute a modification or rescission proceeding; or

        (iii) The petitioner withdraws the petition.

        (2) If exceptional circumstances preclude Commission adherence to the 30-day deadline for determining whether to institute a modification or rescission proceeding on the basis of the petition, the determination will be made as soon after that deadline as possible.

        (3) If the petitioner desires to have the Commission postpone making a determination on whether to institute a modification or rescission proceeding in response to the petition, the petitioner must file a written request with the Secretary. If the request is granted, the determination will be rescheduled for a date that is appropriate in light of the facts.

        (4) The petitioner may withdraw the complaint as a matter of right at any time before the Commission votes on whether to institute a modification or rescission proceeding. To effect such withdrawal, the petitioner must file a written notice with the Commission.

        (5) The Commission shall institute a modification or rescission proceeding by publication of a notice in the  The notice will define the scope of the modification or rescission proceeding and may be amended by leave of the Commission.

#### § § 210.79

        (a)  Upon request of any person, the Commission may, upon such investigation as it deems necessary, issue an advisory opinion as to whether any person's proposed course of action or conduct would violate a Commission exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order. Any responses to a request for an advisory opinion shall be filed within 10 days of service of the request. The Commission will consider whether the issuance of such an advisory opinion would facilitate the enforcement of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, would be in the public interest, and would benefit consumers and competitive conditions in the United States, and whether the person has a compelling business need for the advice and has framed his request as fully and accurately as possible.

        (iii) The petitioner withdraws the request.

        (2) If exceptional circumstances preclude Commission adherence to the 30-day deadline for determining whether to institute an advisory proceeding on the basis of the request, the determination will be made as soon after that deadline as possible.

        (3) If the requester desires that the Commission postpone making a determination on whether to institute an advisory proceeding in response to its request, the requester must file a written request with the Secretary. If the request is granted, the determination will be rescheduled for whatever date is appropriate in light of the facts.

        (4) The requester may withdraw the request as a matter of right at any time before the Commission votes on whether to institute an advisory proceeding. To effect such withdrawal, the requester must file a written notice with the Commission.

        (5) The Commission shall institute an advisory proceeding by publication of a notice in the  The notice will define the scope of the advisory opinion and may be amended by leave of the Commission.

        (b)  The Commission may at any time reconsider any advice given under this section and, where the public interest requires, revoke its prior advice. In such event the person will be given notice of the Commission's intent to revoke as well as an opportunity to submit its views to the Commission. The Commission will not proceed against a person for violation of an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order with respect to any action that was taken in good faith reliance upon the Commission's advice under this section, if all relevant facts were accurately presented to the Commission and such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of revocation of the Commission's advice.

    PART 212—IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT

### Part 212

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 203(a)(1), Pub. L. 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 (5 U.S.C. 504(c)(1)).

**Source:** Source: 47 FR 9391, Mar. 5, 1982, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 212.01   Purpose.

#### § § 212.01

        (a) The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before an agency. Under the Act an eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the Commission proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.

        § 212.02   When the Act applies.

#### § § 212.02

        The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the Commission at any time between October 1, 1981 and September 30, 1984. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981 if final Commission action has not been taken before that date, and proceedings pending on September 30, 1984, regardless of when they were initiated or when final Commission action occurs.

        § 212.03   Proceedings covered.

#### § § 212.03

        (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. The Commission proceedings covered are those conducted under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337. No award shall be made, however, for fees and expenses related to those portions of the proceedings conducted for the consideration of relief, the public interest, and bonding pursuant to subsections 337 (d), (e), and (f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and 19 CFR 210.14.

        (b) An award may be made against the Commission only in connection with a proceeding brought by the Commission upon its own complaint.

        (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

        § 212.04   Eligibility of applicants.

#### § § 212.04

        (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a _party_ to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term  is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3) and 19 CFR 210.04. The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.

        (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:

        (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $1 million;

        (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;

        (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;

        (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1144j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and

        (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and not more than 500 employees.

        (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adversary adjudication was initiated.

        (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered to be an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.

        (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.

        (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the presiding officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the presiding officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

        (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

        § 212.05   Standards for awards.

#### § § 212.05

        (a) The determination whether an applicant is a prevailing party shall be made on a case-by-case basis.

        (b) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with an adversary adjudication, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the adversary adjudication, unless the position of the Commission investigative attorney was substantially justified. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the Commission investigative attorney. An award may be avoided by showing that the position of the Commission was reasonable in law and fact.

        (c) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust. The burden of proof that an award should be reduced or denied for either of these reasons is on the Commission investigative attorney.

        § 212.06   Allowable fees and expenses.

#### § § 212.06

        (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.

        (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses. However, an award may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or expert witness as a separate item if the attorney, agent or expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.

        (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the presiding officer shall consider the following:

        (1) If the attorney, agent or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the service;

        (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or expert witness ordinarily performs services;

        (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

        (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudication; and

        (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.

        (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

        § 212.07   Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

#### § § 212.07

        (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in the proceedings covered by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.

        (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Commission should establish. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Commission will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

      Subpart B—Information Required From Applicants

        § 212.10   Contents of application.

#### § § 212.10

        (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Commission investigative attorney that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.

        (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $1 million (if an individual) or $5 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:

        (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or

        (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).

        (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.

        (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.

        (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

        § 212.11   Net worth exhibit.

#### § § 212.11

        (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 212.04(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The presiding officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.

        (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the presiding officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain in detail why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on the Commission investigative attorney or counsel representing another agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the presiding officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act, 19 CFR 201.17-201.21.

        § 212.12   Documentation of fees and expenses.

#### § § 212.12

        The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The presiding officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.

        § 212.13   When an application may be filed.

#### § § 212.13

        (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the adversary adjudication or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the adversary adjudication, but in no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the adversary adjudication.

        (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a determination as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.

The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon request by the applicant and the Commission investigative attorney.

        (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the position of the Commission. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adversary adjudication, the Commission investigative attorney shall include with the answer supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 212.25.

        § 212.22   Reply.

A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the presiding officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.

        § 212.24   Settlement.

#### § § 212.24

        The applicant and the Commission may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying adversary adjudication, or after the underlying adversary adjudication has been concluded. If a prevailing party and the Commission investigative attorney agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.

        § 212.25   Further proceedings.

#### § § 212.25

        (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or the Commission investigative attorney, or on his or her own initiative, the presiding officer may in his or her discretion order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.

        (b) A request that the presiding officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

        § 212.26   Determination.

#### § § 212.26

      (2) Conducts operations or activities that are being investigated by the Commission; or

      (3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty.

      (b) The prohibitions set forth under paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to:

      (1) Solicitations or acceptances based on obvious family or personal relationships (such as those between parents, children, or spouse of the employee and the employee) when the circumstances make it clear that it is those relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned which are the motivating factors;

      (2) The acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on a field trip, and of ground transportation of nominal value in the course of a field trip, where an employee may properly be in attendance.

      (3) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans; and

      (4) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal value.

      (c) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself (5 U.S.C. 7351).

      (e) Neither this section nor § 200.735-106 precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.

In addition, Commissioners shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the Commission, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information.

      The procedures in this subpart are established pursuant to subsection 207(j) of title 18, United States Code, for the administrative enforcement of the restrictions on postemployment activities in Title V of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b), and (c)) and implementing regulations published by the Office of Government Ethics (5 CFR part 737). Subsections 207 (a), (b), and (c) of Title 18, United States Code, prohibit certain forms of representational activity or communications by former Commission employees.

      § 200.735-125   Exemption from restrictions.

#### § § 200.735-125

      (a)  Communications of a former Commission employee solely for the purpose of furnishing scientific or technological information solicited by the Commission in the course of its statutory investigations are exempted from the restrictions on postemployment practices.

      (b) —(1)  A former Commission employee may be exempted from the restrictions on postemployment practices if the Chairman, in consultation with the Director, Office of Government Ethics (the Director), executes a certification published in the  that the former Commission employee has outstanding qualifications in a scientific, technological, or other technical discipline; that the former Commission employee is acting with respect to a particular matter which requires such qualifications; and that the national interest would be served by the former Commission employee's participation.

      (2)  Certification shall be by the Chairman, or in the absence thereof, by the acting head of the Commission. Consultation with the Director shall precede any certification. The exemption is effective upon the execution of the certification. The Secretary shall immediately transmit the certification to the  for publication.

      (c) —(1)  A former Commission employee may testify before any court, board, commission, or legislative body with respect to matters of fact within the personal knowledge of the former Commission employee.

      (2)  A former Commission employee may make any statements required to be made under penalty of perjury, such as those required in registration statements for securities, tax returns, or security clearances. The exception does not, however, permit a former employee to submit pleadings, applications, or other documents in a representational capacity on behalf of another merely because the attorney or other representative must sign the documents under oath or penalty of perjury.

      (3) The Chairman shall take all necessary steps to protect the privacy of former employees prior to a determination of sufficient cause to initiate an administrative disciplinary hearing.

      (b)  (1) The Chairman shall provide the former Commission employee with notice of an administrative disciplinary proceeding and an opportunity for a hearing.
