      § 910.128   Disputes and appeals.

#### § § 910.128

      (a)  Whenever practicable, DOE shall attempt to resolve informally any dispute over the award or administration of Federal financial assistance. Informal resolution, including resolution through an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, shall be preferred over formal procedures, to the extent practicable.

      (b)  Before issuing a final determination in any dispute in which informal resolution has not been achieved, the Contracting Officer shall suggest that the other party consider the use of voluntary consensual methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation. The DOE dispute resolution specialist is available to provide assistance for such disputes, as are trained mediators of other federal agencies. ADR may be used at any stage of a dispute.

      (c)  Whenever a dispute is not resolved informally or through an alternative dispute resolution process, DOE shall mail (by certified mail) a brief written determination signed by a Contracting Officer, setting forth DOE's final disposition of such dispute. Such determination shall contain the following information:

      (1) A summary of the dispute, including a statement of the issues and of the positions taken by DOE and the party or parties to the dispute; and

      (2) The factual, legal and, if appropriate, policy reasons for DOE's disposition of the dispute.

      (d)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the final determination under paragraph (c) of this section may be appealed to the cognizant Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for either DOE or the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The appeal must be received by DOE within 90 days of the receipt of the final determination. The mailing address for the DOE SPE is Office of Acquisition and Project Management, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585. The mailing address for the NNSA SPE is Office of Acquisition Management, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), 1000 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20585.

      (e)  The filing of an appeal with the SPE shall not stay any determination or action taken by DOE which is the subject of the appeal. Consistent with its obligation to protect the interests of the Federal Government, DOE may take such authorized actions as may be necessary to preserve the status quo pending decision by the SPE, or to preserve its ability to provide relief in the event the SPE decides in favor of the appellant.

      (f)  (1) The SPE shall have no jurisdiction to review:

      (i) Any preaward dispute (except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section), including use of any special restrictive condition pursuant to 2 CFR 200.208 Specific Conditions;

      (ii) DOE denial of a request for an Exception under 2 CFR 200.102;

      (iv) Any DOE action authorized under 2 CFR 200.339, Remedies for Noncompliance, or such actions authorized by program rule;

      (v) Any DOE decision about an action requiring prior DOE approval under 2 CFR 200.325 or under another term or condition of the award;

      (2) In addition to any right of appeal established by program rule, or by the terms and conditions (not inconsistent with paragraph (f)(1) of this section) of an award, the SPE shall have jurisdiction to review:

      (i) A DOE determination that the recipient has failed to comply with the applicable requirements of this part, the program statute or rules, or other terms and conditions of the award;

      (ii) A DOE decision not to make a continuation award based on any of the determinations described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section;

      (iii) Termination of an award, in whole or in part, by DOE under 2 CFR 200.340(a)(1) and (2);

      (iv) A DOE determination that an award is void or invalid;

      (v) The application by DOE of an indirect cost rate; and

      (vi) DOE disallowance of costs.

      (3) In reviewing disputes authorized under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the SPE shall be bound by the applicable law, statutes, and rules, including the requirements of this part, and by the terms and conditions of the award.

#### § § 910.130

      In addition to the requirements of 2 CFR 200.306 the following requirements apply to research, development, demonstration and commercial application activities:

      (a) Cost sharing is required for most financial assistance awards for research, development, demonstration and commercial applications activities initiated after the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on August 8, 2005. This requirement does not apply to:

      (1) An award under the small business innovation research program (SBIR) or the small business technology transfer program (STTR); or

      (2) A program with cost sharing requirements defined by other than Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 including other sections of the 2005 Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

      (b) A cost share of at least 20 percent of the cost of the activity is required for research and development except where:

      (1) A research or development activity of a basic or fundamental nature has been excluded by an appropriate officer of DOE, generally an Under Secretary; or

      (2) The Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce or eliminate the cost sharing requirement for a research and development activity of an applied nature.

      (c) A cost share of at least 50 percent of the cost of a demonstration or commercial application activity is required unless the Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the cost sharing requirements, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity.

      (d) Cost share shall be provided by non-Federal funds unless otherwise authorized by statute. In calculating the amount of the non-Federal contribution:

      (1) Base the non-Federal contribution on total project costs, including the cost of work where funds are provided directly to a partner, consortium member or subrecipient, such as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center;

      (2) Include the following costs as allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles:

      (i) Cash;

      (ii) Personnel costs;

      (iii) The value of a service, other resource, or third party in-kind contribution determined in accordance with Subpart E—Cost Principles—of 2 CFR part 200.

      § 910.132   Research misconduct.

#### § § 910.132

      (a) A recipient is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research of any kind under an award from DOE including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      (b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:

      means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.

      means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.

      means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.

      means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.

      means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.

      means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.

      means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

      means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

      means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.

      (c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:

      (1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;

      (2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).

      (3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.

      (d) DOE may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:

      (1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;

      (2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;

      (3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,

      (4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.

      (e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.

      (f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and DOE, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:

      (1)  The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: Protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.

      (2)  The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.

      (3)  The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.

      (4)  To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.

      (5)  If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.

      (g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.

      (h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.

      § 910.133   Deviation authority.

#### § § 910.133

      (a)  (1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with § 910.372, exceptions under 2 CFR 200.102, and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 910.130 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities are not subject to this section.

      (2) A single-case deviation is a deviation which applies to one financial assistance transaction and one applicant, recipient, or subrecipient only.

      (3) A class deviation is a deviation which applies to more than one financial assistance transaction, applicant, recipient, or subrecipient.

      (b)  The DOE/NNSA officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section may authorize a deviation only upon a written determination that the deviation is—

      (1) Necessary to achieve program objectives;

      (2) Necessary to conserve public funds;

      (3) Otherwise essential to the public interest; or

      (4) Necessary to achieve equity.

      (c)  (1) A deviation request must be in writing and must be submitted to the responsible DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer. An applicant for a subaward or a subrecipient shall submit any such request through the recipient.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section—

      (i) A single-case deviation may be authorized by the responsible HCA.

      (ii) A class deviation may be authorized by the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee.

      (3) Whenever the approval of OMB, other Federal agency, or other DOE/NNSA office is required to authorize a deviation, the proposed deviation must be submitted to the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee for concurrence prior to submission to the authorizing official.

      (d)  Whenever a request for a class deviation is approved, DOE/NNSA will identify this class deviation (as applicable) in the Notice of Funding Opportunity(s) that may be affected.

      (e)  A recipient may use a deviation in a subaward only with the prior written approval of a DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer.

    Subpart D—Post Award Federal Requirements for For-Profit Entities

      § 910.350   Applicability of 2 CFR part 200.

#### § § 910.350

      (a) As stated in 2 CFR 910.22, unless otherwise noted in this part, the definition of Non-Federal entity found in 2 CFR 200.1 is expanded for DOE to include for-profit organizations in addition to states, local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education (IHE), and nonprofit organizations.

      (b) A for-profit organization is defined as one that distributes any profit not reinvested into the business as profit or dividends to its employees or shareholders.

      (c) Subpart D of 2 CFR part 910 contains specific changes to 2 CFR part 200 that apply only to For-Profit Recipients and, unless otherwise specified, subrecipients. In some cases, the coverage in Subpart D will replace the language in a specific section of 2 CFR part 200.

      § 910.352   Cost Principles.

#### § § 910.352

      For For-Profit Entities, the Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR 31.2 (Contracts with Commercial Organizations) must be followed in lieu of the Cost principles contained in 2 CFR 200.400 through 200.476, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document. This applies to For-Profit entities whether they are recipients or subrecipients.

> [79 FR 76024, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]

      § 910.354   Payment.

#### § § 910.354

      (a) For-Profit Recipients are an exception to 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) which requires that non-Federal entities be paid in advance as long as certain conditions are met.

      (b) For For-Profit Recipients who are paid directly by DOE, reimbursement is the preferred method of payment. Under the reimbursement method of payment, the Federal awarding agency must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency reasonably believes the request to be improper.

      § 910.356   Audits.

#### § § 910.356

      See Subpart F of this part (Sections 910.500 through 910.521) for specific DOE regulations which apply to audits of DOE's For-Profit Recipients. For-Profit entities are an exception to the Single Audit requirements contained in Subpart F of 2 CFR 200 and therefore the regulations contained in 2 CFR 910 Subpart F apply instead.

      § 910.358   Profit or fee for SBIR/STTR.

#### § § 910.358

      (a) As authorized by 2 CFR 200.400 (g), DOE may expressly allow non-federal entities to earn a profit or fee resulting from Federal financial assistance.

      (b) DOE allows a profit or fee to be paid under two of its financial assistance programs only: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR).

      (c) Awards under these programs will contain a specific provision which allows a profit or fee to be paid.

      (d) Profit or Fee is unallowable for all other DOE programs which award grants and cooperative agreements.

      § 910.360   Real property and equipment.

#### § § 910.360

      (a)  Recipients may purchase real property or equipment with an acquisition cost per unit of $5,000 or more in whole or in part with Federal funds only with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or in accordance with express award terms.

      (b)  Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient, subject to all terms and conditions of the award and that the recipient shall:

      (1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, as may be determined by the contracting officer;

      (2) Not encumber or permit any encumbrance on the real property or equipment without the prior written approval of the contracting officer;

      (3) Use and dispose of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section; and

      (4) Properly record, and consent to the Department's ability to properly record if the recipient fails to do so, UCC financing statement(s) for all equipment purchased with Federal funds (Financial assistance awards made under the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program are exempt from this requirement unless otherwise specified within the grant agreement); such a filing is required when the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $1,000,000, and the Contracting Officer may require it in his or her discretion when the Federal share is less than $1,000,000. These financing statement(s) must be approved in writing by the contracting officer prior to the recording, and they shall provide notice that the recipient's title to all equipment (not real property) purchased with Federal funds under the financial assistance agreement is conditional pursuant to the terms of this section, and that the Government retains an undivided reversionary interest in the equipment. The UCC financing statement(s) must be filed before the contracting officer may reimburse the recipient for the Federal share of the equipment unless otherwise provided for in the relevant financial assistance agreement. The recipient shall further make any amendments to the financing statements or additional recordings, including appropriate continuation statements, as necessary or as the contracting officer may direct.

      (c)  If the recipient fails at any time to comply with any of the conditions or requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, then the contracting officer may:

      (1) Notify the recipient of noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339, which may lead to suspension or termination of the award;

      (2) Impose special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206 and 200.208 as amended by 910.372;

      (3) Issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;

      (4) In the case of a failure to properly record UCC financing statement(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, effect such a recording; and

      (5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.

      (d)  As provided in 2 CFR 200.306(h), depending upon the purpose of the Federal award, a recipient may offer the fair market value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the recipient holds conditional title to the property and the Government has an undivided reversionary interest in the share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project. The property is treated as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and to the provisions of 2 CFR 200.311 and 200.313.

      (e)  Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.

      (f)  Unless a statute and the award terms expressly provide for the vesting of unconditional title to real property or equipment with the recipient, the real property or equipment acquired wholly or in part with Federal funds is subject to the following:

      (1) During the Project Period, the recipient must make real property and equipment available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:

      (i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

      (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

      (iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.

      (2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or if, as may be determined by the contracting officer, the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, or if the recipient suspends work on the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, if:

      (i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used;

      (ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded Federal award; and

      (iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (iv) If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the recipient must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

      (g)  (1) If, as determined by the contracting officer, an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, or if the recipient has suspended work on the project, the recipient has the following options:

      (i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.

      (ii) If the property is equipment (rather than real property) and with the written approval of the contracting officer, the recipient may replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment.

      (iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

      (iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.

      (2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:

      (i) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:

      (A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to a third party designated by the contracting officer provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred; or

      (B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.

      (3) If the contracting officer fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

      § 910.362   Intellectual property.

#### § § 910.362

      (a)  This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement made to a For-Profit entity by DOE.

      (b)  In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.

      (c) —

      (1)  Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)—No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.

      (2)  Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:

      (i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;

      (ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or

      (iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.

      (3)  Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,  clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.

      (d)  (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data—General”.

      (2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.

      (3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,  DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.

      (e)  (1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.

      (2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.

      (f)  If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data—SBIR Program”.

      (g)  (1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.

      (2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.

      (3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.

      § 910.364   Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.

#### § § 910.364

      (a) Unless otherwise instructed, a recipient that obtains title to an invention made under an award shall submit annual reports on the utilization or efforts to obtain utilization of the invention for at least 10 years from the date the invention was first disclosed to DOE (Utilization Reports). Utilization Reports shall include at least the following information:

      (1) Status of development;

      (2) Date of first commercial sale or use;

      (3) Gross royalties received by the recipient;

      (4) The location of any manufacture of products embodying the subject invention; and

      (5) Any such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify.

      (b) To the extent data or information supplied in a Utilization Report is considered by the recipient to be privileged and confidential and is so marked by the recipient, DOE agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.

      § 910.366   Export Control and U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.

#### § § 910.366

      (a)  Any recipient of any award for research, development and/or demonstration must comply with all applicable U.S. laws regarding export control.

      (b)  It is the policy of DOE to ensure that DOE-funded research, development, and/or demonstration projects foster domestic manufacturing. Funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), therefore, may require that applicants submit a “U.S. Manufacturing Plan” in their applications. Such FOAs may encourage U.S. Manufacturing Plans to include proposals by recipients and any sub-recipients to manufacture DOE-funded technologies in the United States; however, the FOAs will also state that these plans should not include requirements regarding the source of inputs used during the manufacturing process. Regardless of whether such plans will be part of the merit review criteria or a program policy factor, and to the extent legally permissible, all awards subject to this subpart, including subawards, for research, development, and/or demonstration, must include a provision that provides plans by the recipient and any subrecipients to support manufacturing in the United States of technology developed under the award. The recipient and any subrecipients must agree to make those plans binding on any assignee or licensee or any entity otherwise acquiring rights to any subject invention or developed technology covered under the award. A recipient, subrecipient, assignee, licensee, or any entity otherwise acquiring the rights to any subject invention or developed technology may request a waiver or modification of U.S. manufacturing plans from DOE. DOE will determine whether to approve such a waiver in light of equitable considerations, including, for example, whether the requester satisfactorily shows that the planned support is not economically feasible and whether there is a satisfactory alternative net benefit to the U.S. economy if the requested waiver or modification is approved.

      § 910.368   Change of control.

#### § § 910.368

      (a) Change of control is defined as any of the following:

      (1) Any event by which any individual or entity other than the recipient becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the recipient;

      (2) The recipient merges with or into any entity other than in a transaction in which the shares of the recipient's voting stock are converted into a majority of the voting stock of the surviving entity;

      (3) The sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the recipient to any individual or entity other than the recipient in one or a series of related transactions;

      (4) The adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the recipient; or

      (5) Where the recipient is a wholly-owned subsidiary at the time of award or novation, and the recipient's parent entity undergoes a change of control as defined in this section.

      (b) When the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $10,000,000 or DOE requests the information in writing, the recipient must provide the contracting officer with documentation identifying all parties who exercise control in the recipient at the time of award.

      (c) When there is a change of control of a recipient, or the recipient has reason to know a change of control is likely, the recipient must notify the contracting officer within 30 days of its knowledge of such change of control. Such notification must include, at a minimum, copies of documents necessary to reflect the transaction that resulted or will result in the change of control, and identification of all entities, individuals or other parties to such transaction. Failure to notify the contracting officer of a change of control is grounds for suspension or termination of the award for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.

      (d) The contracting officer must authorize a change of control for the purposes of the award. Failure to receive the contracting officer's authorization for a change of control may lead to a suspension of the award, termination for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or imposition of special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 910.372. Special award conditions may include but are not limited to:

      (1) Additional reporting requirements related to the change of control; and

      (2) Suspension of payments due to the recipient.

      § 910.370   Novation of financial assistance agreements.

#### § § 910.370

      (a) Financial assistance agreements are not assignable absent written consent from the contracting officer. At his or her sole discretion, the contracting officer may, through novation, recognize a third party as the successor in interest to a financial assistance agreement if such recognition is in the Government's interest, conforms with all applicable laws and the third party's interest in the agreement arises out of the transfer of:

      (1) All of the recipient's assets; or

      (2) The entire portion of the assets necessary to perform the project described in the agreement.

      (b) When the contracting officer determines that it is not in the Government's interest to consent to the novation of a financial assistance agreement from the original recipient to a third party, the original recipient remains subject to the terms of the financial assistance agreement, and the Department may exercise all legally available remedies under 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343, or that may be otherwise available, should the original recipient not perform.

      (c) The contracting officer may require submission of any documentation in support of a request for novation, including but not limited to documents identified in 48 CFR Subpart 42.12. The contracting officer may use the format in 48 CFR 42.1204 as guidance for novation agreements identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 910.401   Application to M&O's.

#### § § 910.401

      In accordance with 48 CFR 970.3002-1 and 970.3101-00-70, a Federally Funded Research Center (FFRDC) which is also a designated DOE Management and Operating (M&O) contract must follow the cost accounting standards (CAS) contained in 48 CFR part 30 and must follow the appropriate Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR part 31.

    Subpart F—Audit Requirements for For-Profit Entities

      General

        § 910.500   Purpose.

#### § § 910.500

        This Part follows the same format as 2 CFR 200.500. We purposely did not renumber the paragraphs within this part so that auditors and recipients can compare this to the single audit requirements contained in 2 CFR 200.500.

      Audits

        § 910.501   Audit requirements.

#### § § 910.501

        (a)  A for-profit entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in DOE awards must have a compliance audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this Part.

        (b)  (1) If a for-profit entity has one or more DOE awards with expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, they must have a compliance audit for each of the awards with $750,000 or more in expenditures. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit.

        (2) If a for-profit entity receives more than one award from DOE with a sum total of expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, but does not have any single award with expenditures of $750,000 or more; the entity must determine whether any or all of the awards have common compliance requirements ( are considered a cluster of awards) and determine the total expenditures of the awards with common compliance requirements. A compliance audit is required for the largest cluster of awards (if multiple clusters of awards exist) or the largest award not in a cluster of awards, whichever corresponding expenditure total is greater. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit;

        (3) If a for-profit entity receives one or more awards from DOE with a sum total of expenditures less than $750,000, no compliance audit is required;

        (4) If the for-profit entity is a sub-recipient, 2 CFR 200.501(h) requires that the pass-through entity establish appropriate monitoring and controls to ensure the sub-recipient complies with award requirements. These compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.514 Scope of audit

        (c)  Not applicable.

        (d)  A for-profit entity that expends less than $750,000 during the for-profit's fiscal year in DOE awards is exempt from DOE audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).

        (e)  Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.

        (f)  An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. The provisions of 2 CFR 200.331, Subrecipient and contractor determinations should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.

        (g)  In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

        (h)  Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients to DOE Federal award requirements. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for- profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits. See also 2 CFR 200.332, Requirements for pass- through entities.

        § 910.502   Basis for determining DOE awards expended.

#### § § 910.502

        (a)  The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the DOE award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards, such as: Expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the for-profit entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.

        (b)  Loan and loan guarantees issued by the DOE Loan Program Office corresponding to Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 16511-16516 (“Title XVII”) are exempt from these provisions.

        (1) Not applicable.

        (2) Not applicable.

        (3) Not applicable.

        (c) Not applicable.

        (d)  See paragraph (b) of this section.

        (e)  The cumulative balance of DOE awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered DOE awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.

        (f)  Free rent received by itself is not considered a DOE award expended under this Part. However, free rent received as part of a DOE award to carry out a DOE program must be included in determining DOE awards expended and subject to audit under this part.

        (g)  DOE non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by DOE.

        (h) Not applicable.

        (i) Not applicable.

        (j) Not applicable.

> [87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]

        § 910.503   Relation to other audit requirements.

#### § § 910.503

        (a) An audit conducted in accordance with this Part must be in lieu of any financial audit of DOE awards which a for-profit entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides DOE with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, DOE must rely upon and use that information.

        (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, DOE, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this Part do not authorize any for-profit entity to constrain, in any manner, DOE from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that DOE must plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of DOE. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed, by other auditors.

        (c) The provisions of this Part do not limit the authority of DOE to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of DOE awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official.

        (d) DOE to pay for additional audits. If DOE conducts or arranges for additional audits it must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.

        (e) Not applicable.

        § 910.504   Frequency of audits.

#### § § 910.504

        Audits required by this Part must be performed annually.

        (a) Not applicable.

        (b) Not applicable.

        § 910.505   Sanctions.

#### § § 910.505

        In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, DOE and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 CFR 200.339, Remedies for noncompliance.

        § 910.507   Compliance audits.

#### § § 910.507

        (a)  In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal controls, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found on the OMB website in the compliance supplement, in part 8, appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides, which includes a website where a copy of the guide can be obtained. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) and the guide when performing a compliance audit.

        (b)  (1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must conduct the compliance audit in accordance with GAAS and GAGAS.

        (2) If audited financial statements are available, for-profit recipients should submit audited financial statements to DOE as a part of the compliance audit. (If the recipient is a subsidiary for which separate financial statements are not available, the recipient may submit the financial statements of the consolidated group.)

        (3) The auditor must:

        (i) Not applicable;

        (ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the DOE program consistent with the requirements of § 910.514 Scope of audit;

        (iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards that could have a direct and material effect on the DOE program consistent with the requirements of § 910.514 Scope of audit;

        (iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding; and

        (v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 910.516 Audit findings.

        (4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

        (i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) (if available) of the DOE program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;

        (ii) A report on internal control related to the DOE program, which must describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;

        (iii) A report on compliance which includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards which could have a direct and material effect on the DOE program; and

        (iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the DOE program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the DOE program in a format consistent with § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (d)(3).

        (c)  (1) The audit must be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make report copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

        (2) When a program-specific audit guide is available, the compliance audits must be submitted (along with audited financial statements if audited financial statements are available), to the appropriate DOE Contracting Officer as well as to the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

        (3) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the reporting package for a program-specific audit must consist of, a summary schedule of prior audit findings, and a corrective action plan as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the auditor's report(s) described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The compliance audit must be submitted (along with audited financial statements if audited financial statements are available), to the appropriate DOE Contracting Officer as well as to the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

        (d)  Compliance audits are subject to:

        (1) Section 910.500 Purpose through § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements, paragraph (d);

        (2) Section 910.504 Frequency of audits through § 910.506 Audit costs;

      Auditees

        § 910.508   Auditee responsibilities.

#### § § 910.508

        The auditee must:

        (a) Procure or otherwise arrange for the audit required by this Part in accordance with § 910.509 Auditor selection, and ensure it is properly performed and submitted when due in accordance with § 910.512 Report submission.

        (b) Submit appropriate financial statements (if available).

        (c) Submit the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards in accordance with § 910.510 Financial statements.

        (d) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow- up, paragraph (b) and § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (c), respectively.

        (e) Provide the auditor with access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and other information as needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this Part.

        § 910.509   Auditor selection.

#### § § 910.509

        (a)  When procuring audit services, the objective is to obtain high-quality audits. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the for-profit entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in 2 CFR 200.321 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.

        (b)  An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this Part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.

        (c)  Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this Part if they comply fully with the requirements of this Part.

        § 910.510   Financial statements.

#### § § 910.510

        (a)  If available, the auditee must submit financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this Part. However, for-profit entity-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 910.514 Scope of audit, paragraph (a) and prepare separate financial statements.

        (b)  The auditee must prepare a schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for the period covered by the auditee's fiscal year which must include the total DOE awards expended as determined in accordance with § 910.502 Basis for determining DOE awards expended. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by DOE and pass- through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a DOE program has multiple DOE award years, the auditee may list the amount of DOE awards expended for each DOE award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:

        (1) List individual DOE programs. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual DOE programs within the cluster of programs. For R&D, total DOE awards expended must be shown by individual DOE award and major subdivision within DOE. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.

        (2) Not applicable.

        (3) Provide total DOE awards expended for each individual DOE program and the CFDA number For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.

        (4) Not applicable.

        (5) Not applicable.

        (6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the for-profit entity elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in 2 CFR 200.414 Indirect (F&A) costs.

        § 910.511   Audit findings follow-up.

#### § § 910.511

        (a)  The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

        (b)  The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.

        (2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in DOE's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.

        (3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:

        (i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to DOE;

        (ii) DOE is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and

        (iii) A management decision was not issued.

        (c)  At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 910.516 Audit findings, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.

        § 910.512   Report submission.

#### § § 910.512

        (a)  (1) The audit must be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.

        (2) Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

        (b)  See paragraph (b)(1) of this section:

        (1) A senior level representative of the auditee ( director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the reporting package that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of this Part, the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information, and the information included in its entirety is accurate and complete.

        (2) Not applicable.

        (3) Not applicable.

        (c)  The reporting package must include the:

      Auditors

        § 910.514   Scope of audit.

#### § § 910.514

        (a)  The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered DOE awards during such audit period, provided that each such audit must encompass the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a for-profit entity. The financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards must be for the same audit period.

        (b)  If financial statements are available, the auditor must determine whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

        (c)  (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

        (2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over DOE programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:

        (i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements; and

        (ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

        (4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.

        (d)  (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect.

        (2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.

        (3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.

        (4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.

        (e)  The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up paragraph (b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor must perform audit follow-up procedures.

        (f) Not applicable.

        § 910.515   Audit reporting.

#### § § 910.515

        The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

        (a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements (if available) are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements (if available) as a whole.

        (b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the DOE award, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control and compliance and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, it will refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c) A report on compliance and report and internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance, include an opinion or modified opinion as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards which could have a direct and material effect and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:

        (1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:

        (i) The type of report the auditor issued (if applicable) on whether the financial statements (if available) audited were prepared in accordance with GAAP ( unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

        (ii) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements (if available);

        (iii) A statement (if applicable) as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements (if available) of the auditee;

        (iv) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;

        (v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance ( unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

        (vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a);

        (vii) Not applicable.

        (viii) Not applicable.

        (ix) Not applicable.

        (2) Findings relating to the financial Statements (if available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

        (3) Findings and questioned costs for DOE awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a).

        (i) Audit findings ( internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding.

        (ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (if available) and DOE awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.

        (e) Nothing in this part precludes combining of the audit reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b), when allowed by GAGAS.

> [87 FR 15322, Mar. 18, 2022]

        § 910.516   Audit findings.

#### § § 910.516

        (a)  The auditor must report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:

        (1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.

        (2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.

        (3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.

        (4) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a DOE program. which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this Part to perform audit procedures for such a DOE program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a DOE program that is not audited as a major program ( as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.

        (5) Not applicable.

        (6) Known or likely fraud affecting a DOE award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for DOE awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to report publicly information which could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.

        (7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

        (b)  Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for DOE to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:

        (1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, and Federal award identification number and year. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or DOE award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.

        (2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the DOE awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.

        (3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

        (4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.

        (5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and DOE to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.

        (6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable CFDA number(s) and applicable DOE award identification number(s).

        (7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.

        (8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.

        (9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

        (10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.

        (c)  Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b) to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.

        § 910.517   Audit documentation.

#### § § 910.517

        (a)  The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by DOE or the cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the audit documentation and reports.

        (b)  Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant agency for indirect cost, DOE, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this Part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation, as is reasonable and necessary.

        § 910.518   [Reserved]

#### § § 910.518

        § 910.519   Criteria for Federal program risk.

#### § § 910.519

        (a)  The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the DOE program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular DOE program with auditee management and DOE.

        (b)  (1) Weaknesses in internal control over DOE programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over DOE programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the DOE programs.

        (i) A DOE program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. The auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit ( one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.

        (ii) When significant parts of a DOE program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.

        (2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a DOE program or have not been corrected.

        (3) DOE programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.

        (c)  (1) Oversight exercised by DOE could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.

        (2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.

        (d)  (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation—personal services, but otherwise be at low risk.

        (2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.

        (3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.

        (4) Programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

        § 910.520   Criteria for a low-risk auditee.

#### § § 910.520

        An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods may qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage.

        (a) Compliance audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart, including submitting the data collection form to DOE within the timeframe specified in § 910.512 Report submission. A for-profit entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.

        (b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements (if available) were prepared in accordance with GAAP, or a basis of accounting required by state law, and the auditor's in relation to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards were unmodified.

        (c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.

        (d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.

        (e) None of the DOE programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods:

        (1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control as required under § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (c);

        (2) Not applicable.

        (3) Not applicable.

      Management Decisions

        § 910.521   Management decision.

#### § § 910.521

        (a)  The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, DOE agency may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements (if they were available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

        (b) As provided in § 910.513 Responsibilities, paragraph (c)(3), DOE is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to DOE awards it makes to for-profit entities.

        (c) Not applicable.

        (d)  DOE must issue a management decision within six months of acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.

        (e)  Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings paragraph (c).

When section 988 of EPAct 2005 applies to an award, the AO must obtain the required approval of the elimination or reduction of the required cost share in accordance with the section 988 of EPAct 2005.

      § 930.130   Fee or profit.

#### § § 930.130

      The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, may not issue an OT agreement if any awardee, subawardees or participant is to receive fee or profit for the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) efforts. This requirement extends to all awardees and performers funded under the project, including any subawards for substantive program performance, but it does not preclude participants' or subawardees' payment of reasonable fee or profit when making purchases from suppliers of goods ( supplies and equipment) or services needed to carry out the RD&D.

      § 930.135   Competition.

#### § § 930.135

      (a) Department of Energy (DOE) awards other transaction (OT) agreements using non-procurement, non-Federal financial assistance competitive processes in a merit-based selection process:

      (1) In every case where required by statute; and

      (2) To the maximum extent feasible, in all other cases. If it is not feasible to use competitive process, the reason for not using a competitive process must be documented by the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements.

      (b) The AO must document any restrictions on awardee eligibility.

      § 930.140   Disclosure of information.

#### § § 930.140

      (a) For all other transaction (OT) agreements, trade secrets and commercial or financial information that would be protected from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency:

      (1) For a period of five years after the date on which the information is developed; or

      (2) For up to thirty years after the date on which the information is developed, if the Secretary or delegee of the Secretary determines that the nature of the technology under the transaction, including nuclear technology, could reasonably require an extended period of protection from disclosure to reach commercialization.

      (b) As provided in 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(1) incorporating certain provisions of 10 U.S.C. 4021, disclosure is not required, and may not be compelled, under FOIA during that period if:

      (1) A proposer submits the information in a competitive or noncompetitive process that could result in the award of an OT agreement; and

      (2) The type of information is among the following types that are exempt:

      (i) Proposals, proposal abstracts, and supporting documents; and

      (ii) Business plans and technical information submitted on a confidential basis.

      (c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical information for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a confidential basis. After the five-year period, information may be protected for longer periods if it meets any of the criteria in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (as implemented by the DOE in 10 CFR part 1004) for exemption from FOIA disclosure requirements.

    Subpart B—Pre-Award Business Evaluation

      § 930.200   Scope.

#### § § 930.200

      This subpart addresses administrative matters that do not impose organization-wide requirements on an awardee's business (financial management, property management, or purchasing) systems. An organization does not have to redesign its business systems to accommodate variations in these requirements. Agreements may differ in the requirements that they specify based on the awardee and the specific circumstances of the research, development, and demonstration project.

      § 930.205   Financial management standards.

#### § § 930.205

      (a) Any awardees that currently perform under other expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards are subject to the same standards for financial management systems that apply to those other Federal awards.

      (b) Any awardees that do not currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards should be allowed to use their existing financial management system as long as the system, at a minimum, effectively controls all project funds, including Federal funds and any required cost share. The system must have complete, accurate, and current records that document the sources of funds and the purposes for which they are disbursed. Awardees also must have procedures for ensuring that project funds are used only for purposes permitted by the agreement.

      § 930.210   Cost principles and standards.

#### § § 930.210

      (a)  The cost principles in 48 CFR part 31 will generally apply to for-profit awardees.

      (b)  The cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 will generally apply to states, local governments, Indian Tribes, institutes of higher education and other nonprofit entities.

      (c)  The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, may establish alternative standards in the agreement as long as that alternative provides, as a minimum, that:

      (1) Federal funds and funds counted as awardees' cost sharing will be used only for costs that a reasonable and prudent person would incur in carrying out the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project contemplated by the agreement.

      (2) Costs must be allocated to DOE and other projects in accordance with the relative benefits the projects receive.

      (3) Costs allocated to DOE projects must be given consistent treatment with costs allocated to the participants' other RD&D activities ( activities supported by the participants themselves or by non-Federal sponsors).

      (4) The standards must also state that the Federal funds and funds counted as participants' cost sharing will be used only for costs that are consistent with the purposes stated in the governing Congressional authorizations and appropriations.

      § 930.215   Audit requirements.

#### § § 930.215

      (a)  If an expenditure-based other transaction (OT) agreement provides for audits of a for-profit participant, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, also must specify:

      (1) Whether the Defense Contract Auditing Agency or an Independent Public Accountant will perform the required audits.

      (2) What the audits are to cover.

      (3) Who will pay for the audits.

      (4) The auditing standards that the auditor will use.

      (5) The available remedies for noncompliance.

      (6) Where the auditor is to send audit reports.

      (7) The retention period for the auditor's working papers.

      (8) Who will have access to the auditor's working papers.

      (b)  Expenditure-based OT agreements are subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). State, local government, Indian Tribes, institutes of higher education, and nonprofit participants are subject to the requirements under that Act. Additional information may be found at 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      § 930.220   Real property and equipment.

#### § § 930.220

      (a) The participant must include the cost of the real property or equipment as part of the proposed cost of the project. The Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, must approve the use of project funds (Federal or cost share) to purchase real property or equipment. The AO should specify the use, management, vesting of title, and disposition requirements in the award.

      (b) The AO may include an alternative property provision where DOE is authorized to grant title to property or equipment acquired under an OT agreement when determined such a grant is appropriate.

      § 930.225   Purchasing systems standards.

#### § § 930.225

      (a) Any awardees that currently perform under other expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards are subject to the same standards for purchasing systems that apply to those other Federal awards.

      (b) Any awardees that do not currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards should be allowed to use its existing purchasing system as long as the system, at a minimum, is able to flow down the applicable requirements in Federal statutes, Executive orders, or Governmentwide regulations.

    Subpart C—Award Terms Related to Other Administrative Matters

      § 930.300   Payment methods.

#### § § 930.300

      Available payment methods include:

      (a)  Under this method, participants request reimbursement for costs incurred during a particular time period. The Department of Energy (DOE) reimburses the participant by electronic funds transfer after approval of the request by the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, or designee. This payment method is used for expenditure-based awards.

      (b)  Under this method, participants request advance payment based upon projections of the cash needs for the project, or for large purchases. Predetermined payment schedules may be used when the timing of the participant's needs to disburse funds can be predicted in advance with sufficient accuracy to ensure the funds are used in accordance with project objectives and schedules.

      (c)  Under this method payments made according to a schedule established for the award that is based on accomplishment of predetermined, well-defined, observable, and verifiable measures of technical progress, outcomes, or other payable milestones. A fixed-support award must use this payment method; however, this does not preclude the use of an initial advance payment if there is no alternative to meeting immediate cash needs. Payments based on payable milestones is the preferred method of payment for an expenditure-based award if well-defined outcomes can be identified.

      § 930.305   Government approval of changes in plans.

#### § § 930.305

      Department of Energy must approve any changes in project plans that may result in a need for additional Federal funding to be provided to the other transaction agreement.

      § 930.310   Pre-award costs.

#### § § 930.310

      Pre-award costs may be reimbursed only with the specific approval of the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements. All pre-award costs are incurred at the applicant's and/or awardee's risk. DOE is not obligated to reimburse the costs if, for any reason, the applicant does not receive an award, the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover the costs, or the AO did not provide prior approval for the reimbursement of the pre-award costs.

      § 930.315   Negotiating data and patent rights.

#### § § 930.315

      The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, must confer with program officials and assigned intellectual property counsel to develop an overall strategy for intellectual property taking into account inventions and data that may result from the project and future needs the Government may have for rights in them. The strategy should address program mission requirements and any special circumstances that would support modification of standard intellectual property provisions, and should include considerations such as the extent of the awardee's contribution to the development of the technology; expected Government or commercial use of the technology; the need to provide equitable treatment among consortium or team members; and the need for DOE to engage non-traditional Government contractors with unique capabilities.

      § 930.320   Data rights.

#### § § 930.320

      (a) For provisions regarding data rights for any awardee entity type, the data rights requirements at 2 CFR 910.362(d), Rights in data-general rule, normally apply when the Government is to be provided with unlimited rights in data and should be used as a starting point for such other transaction (OT) agreements. Here, the “Rights in Data—General” provision in appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 910 typically applies. However, if the awardee is to receive special data protection, the data requirements at 2 CFR 910.362(e), Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes normally apply and should be used as a starting point for such OT agreements. Here, the “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” provision in appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 910 typically applies. Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(5), data protection can be provided typically for a period of up to 5 years but may be extended up to a total of 30 years in particular circumstances.

      (b) However, while maintaining compliance with 42 U.S.C. 7256(g), the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, may negotiate data rights requirements that vary from those listed above. Use of or modifications to the standard rights in data provisions must be approved by cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.

      § 930.325   Rights in inventions.

#### § § 930.325

      (a) When negotiating rights in inventions, the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, should negotiate terms that represent an appropriate balance between the Government's interests and the awardee's interests. Bayh-Dole (35 U.S.C. 200-212) patent rights provisions implemented via 37 CFR 401.14 as modified by the DOE ( U.S. Competitiveness provision and Department of Energy Determination of Exceptional Circumstances Under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies) should be used as a starting point for all awardee entity types. However, the AO may negotiate rights that vary from those in modified 37 CFR 401.14. For example, Bayh-Dole March-in-Rights found in modified 37 CFR 401.14 and concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the right to use subject inventions if the awardee fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject inventions within a reasonable time, may be modified or removed entirely. Use of or modifications to the standard rights provisions must be approved by cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.

      (b) For subawards, the OT should typically indicate that sub-awardees will get title to inventions they make but alternative terms could be included such as those specifying that sub-awardees' invention rights are to be negotiated between awardee and sub-awardee or some other disposition of invention rights.

      § 930.330   Research and technology security and U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness requirements.

#### § § 930.330

      (a)  Consistent with the objective of enhancing national security and United States competitiveness by increasing the public's reliance on United States commercial technology, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, must include provisions in an OT agreement that addresses foreign access to technology developed under the OT agreement. Provisions must be included in an OT that provide, at a minimum, that any transfer of the technology must be consistent with the U.S. export control laws, regulations and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation at Chapter VII, Subchapter C, Title 15 of the CFR (15 CFR parts 730-774), as applicable.

      (b)  All DOE research and technology security policies apply to OTs unless the activities being funded are outside the scope of the policies or otherwise exempted from the policies.

      (c)  Notice should be included in the OT indicating that products embodying any invention or produced through the use of any invention are subject to the U.S. Competitiveness terms outlined in modified 37 CFR 401.14. These terms may not be modified or waived without approval from cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.

      § 930.335   Record retention requirements.

#### § § 930.335

      (a) Awardees must keep records related to the agreement for a period of three years after submission of the final financial status report for an expenditure-based award or final program performance report for a fixed-support award, with the following exceptions:

      (1) The awardees must keep records longer than three years after submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its conclusion within the 3-year period. In that case, the awardees must keep the records until the matter is resolved and final action taken.

      (2) Records for any real property or equipment acquired with project funds under the agreement must be kept for three years after final disposition.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 930.340   Access to records.

#### § § 930.340

      (a) The Department of Energy (DOE), through the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, has an unfettered right of timely access to any documents, papers, or other records of the awardee which are pertinent to the Federal award, in order to inspect and make copies, audits, examinations, excerpts, and/or transcripts. The right also includes timely and reasonable access to the awardee's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The exercise of this authority is at the discretion of the AO.

      (b) Inspectors General and the Comptroller General of the United States may have independent legal authority to access to records or personnel related to the Federal award. Consistent with the independent legal authority, recipients should follow the laws and regulations applicable to requests for access to records or personnel from Inspectors General and the Comptroller General of the United States.

      § 930.345   Noncompliance and termination requirements.

#### § § 930.345

      (a)  If an awardee materially fails to comply with the articles or terms and conditions of an agreement, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, plan, or the notice of award, the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:

      (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the awardee or more severe enforcement action by the AO.

      (2) Disallow or deny both the use of funds and any applicable cost share for all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

      (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

      (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

      (5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.

      (b)  The OT agreement must include an article that indicates that the Government may terminate the agreement in whole or in part if the awardee materially fails to comply with the articles or terms and conditions of an agreement, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, plan, or the notice of award fails to comply with the articles and requirements of the award. An agreement may include an article providing for the termination of the agreement, in whole or in part, by mutual agreement or as negotiated by the parties. In the case of proposed partial termination of the agreement, if the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the agreement was made, the award may be terminated in its entirety.

      (1) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of an expenditure-based award, DOE's maximum liability is the lesser of:

      (i) DOE's share of allowable costs incurred up to the date of termination, or

      (ii) The amount of DOE funds obligated to the award.

      (2) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of a fixed-support based award, DOE shall pay the awardee for the last fully completed milestone.

      (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, if the awardee initiates termination and the award includes milestone payments, the Government has no obligation to pay the awardee beyond the last completed and paid milestone.

      (c)  (1) The awardee has the right to appeal to the cognizant Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), as defined by 41 U.S.C. 1702(c), to review only the following actions:

      (i) A DOE determination that the awardee has failed to comply with the applicable requirements of the award;

      (ii) Termination of an award, in whole or in part, by DOE;

      (iii) The application by DOE of an indirect cost rate; and

      (iv) DOE disallowance of costs.

      (2) In reviewing appeals authorized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the SPE is bound by the applicable law, statutes, and rules, including the requirements of this part, and by the articles or terms and conditions of the award.

      (3) The decision of the SPE shall be the final decision of DOE.

    Subpart D—Appropriate Use of Technology Investment Agreements

      § 930.400   Use of Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).

#### § § 930.400

      For purposes of this part, a Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) is a special type of other transaction (OT) agreement that is an assistance instrument used to increase involvement of a for-profit entity or segment of a for-profit entity ( a division or other business unit) that does a substantial portion of its business in the commercial marketplace in Department of Energy's (DOE) research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) programs. A TIA requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management aspects of the project. The goal for using a TIA is to broaden the technology base available to meet DOE mission requirements and foster within the technology base new relationships and practices to advance the national economic and energy security of the United States, to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission, and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex. A TIA therefore is designed to reduce barriers to participation in RD&D programs by for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace. A TIA allows Agreements Officers (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, to tailor Government requirements and lower or remove barriers if it can be done with proper stewardship of Federal funds. A TIA may also promote new relationships among performers in the technology base. Collaborations among for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace, firms that regularly perform on the DOE RD&D programs and nonprofit organizations can enhance overall quality and productivity.

      § 930.405   TIA awardees.

#### § § 930.405

      (a) A Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) may be awarded to a single entity or multiple entities ( a teaming arrangement) in prime award-subaward relationships.

      (b) A TIA requires one or more for-profit entities, not acting in their capacity as the contractor operating a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), to be involved either in the:

      (1) Performance of the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project; or

      (2) The commercial application of the results of the RD&D project.

      (c)(1) In those cases where there is only a non-profit awardee or a consortium of non-profit entities or non-profit entities and FFRDC contractors (as sub-awardees), if and as authorized, the awardees must have at least a tentative agreement with a specific for-profit entity or entities that plan on being involved in the commercial application of the results.

      (2) In consultation with legal counsel, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, must review the agreement between the parties to ensure that the for-profit entity is committed to being involved in the commercial application of the results.

      § 930.410   Purchase of real property and equipment by for-profit firms.

#### § § 930.410

      Federal funds provided under another transaction (OT) agreement to for-profit entities must not be used to purchase real property or equipment. If the OT agreement requires the purchase of real property or equipment, the for-profit entity must use its own funds that are separate from the research, development, and demonstration project. The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, should allow the for-profit participant to charge to an expenditure-based award or include in the cost estimate for fixed-support award, only depreciation or use charges for the real property or equipment. Note that the for-profit must charge depreciation consistently with its usual accounting practices and policies. Many for-profits treat depreciation as an indirect cost. Any for-profit that usually charges depreciation indirectly for a particular type of property must not charge depreciation for that property as a direct cost to the OT agreement.

      § 930.415   Government participation.

#### § § 930.415

      A Technology Investment Agreements is used to carry out cooperative relationships between the Federal Government and the awardee(s) which require substantial involvement of the Government in the technical and/or management aspects of the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project.
