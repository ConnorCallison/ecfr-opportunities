In this regard, the NTSB will consider whether a requester's use of the documents would enhance transportation safety or contribute to the NTSB's programs.\n",
                  "(ii) Whether the portions of a record subject to disclosure are meaningfully informative about government operations or activities.

In determining whether the request is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the NTSB will consider the following factors:\n",
                  "(i) The existence and magnitude of any commercial interest the requester may have, or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting. The NTSB will provide requesters with an opportunity in the administrative process to submit explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n",
                  "(ii) Whether the commercial interest is greater in magnitude than any public interest in disclosure.\n",
                  "(4) Additionally, the NTSB may, at its discretion, waive search, duplication, and review fees for qualifying foreign countries, international organizations, nonprofit public safety entities, state and federal transportation agencies, and colleges and universities, after approval by the Chief, Records Management Division.\n",

The eagle's wings, body, and upper portion of the legs are shades of brown. The head, neck, and tail are white. The beak, lower portion of the legs, feet, arrows, olive branch, and encircling inscription are gold.

When the full color seal is embroidered on official NTSB uniform items, the seal's background must be the color of the material. When the monochrome seal is used on print or digital media, the seal can be displayed in black, blue, or in white on contrasting background.

Where a local index is available, but results in a manifest inequity vis-a-vis the U.S. City Average, the U.S. City Average may be used. The numerator of that equation is the yearly average for the year(s) the services were provided, with each year calculated separately. If an annual average CPI for a particular year is not yet available, the prior year's annual average CPI shall be used. This formula increases the $75 statutory cap by indexing it to reflect cost of living increases, as authorized in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A)(ii). Application of these increased rate caps requires affirmative findings under § 821.6(c) of this chapter. For ease of application, available U.S. City figures are reproduced as follows:\n"
