    PART 482—CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION FOR HOSPITALS

### Part 482

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395hh, and 1395rr, unless otherwise noted.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 22042, June 17, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 482.1   Basis and scope.

#### § § 482.1

        (a)  (1) Section 1861(e) of the Act provides that—

        (i) Hospitals participating in Medicare must meet certain specified requirements; and

        (ii) The Secretary may impose additional requirements if they are found necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are furnished services in hospitals.

        (2) Section 1861(f) of the Act provides that an institution participating in Medicare as a psychiatric hospital must meet certain specified requirements imposed on hospitals under section 1861(e), must be primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill persons, must maintain clinical records and other records that the Secretary finds necessary, and must meet staffing requirements that the Secretary finds necessary to carry out an active program of treatment for individuals who are furnished services in the hospital. A distinct part of an institution can participate as a psychiatric hospital if the institution meets the specified 1861(e) requirements and is primarily engaged in providing psychiatric services, and if the distinct part meets the records and staffing requirements that the Secretary finds necessary.

        (3) Sections 1861(k) and 1902(a)(30) of the Act provide that hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid must have a utilization review plan that meets specified requirements.

        (4) Section 1883 of the Act sets forth the requirements for hospitals that provide long term care under an agreement with the Secretary.

        (5) Section 1905(a) of the Act provides that “medical assistance” (Medicaid) payments may be applied to various hospital services. Regulations interpreting those provisions specify that hospitals receiving payment under Medicaid must meet the requirements for participation in Medicare (except in the case of medical supervision of nurse-midwife services. See §§ 440.10 and 440.165 of this chapter.).

        (b)  Except as provided in subpart A of part 488 of this chapter, the provisions of this part serve as the basis of survey activities for the purpose of determining whether a hospital qualifies for a provider agreement under Medicare and Medicaid.

        § 482.2   Provision of emergency services by nonparticipating hospitals.

#### § § 482.2

        (a) The services of an institution that does not have an agreement to participate in the Medicare program may, nevertheless, be reimbursed under the program if—

        (1) The services are emergency services; and

        (2) The institution meets the requirements of section 1861(e) (1) through (5) and (7) of the Act. Rules applicable to emergency services furnished by nonparticipating hospitals are set forth in subpart G of part 424 of this chapter.

        (b) Section 440.170(e) of this chapter defines emergency hospital services for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement.

#### § § 482.11

        (a) The hospital must be in compliance with applicable Federal laws related to the health and safety of patients.

        (b) The hospital must be—

        § 482.12   Condition of participation: Governing body.

#### § § 482.12

        There must be an effective governing body that is legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital. If a hospital does not have an organized governing body, the persons legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital must carry out the functions specified in this part that pertain to the governing body.

        (a)  The governing body must:

        (1) Determine, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are eligible candidates for appointment to the medical staff;

        (2) Appoint members of the medical staff after considering the recommendations of the existing members of the medical staff;

        (3) Assure that the medical staff has bylaws;

        (4) Approve medical staff bylaws and other medical staff rules and regulations;

        (5) Ensure that the medical staff is accountable to the governing body for the quality of care provided to patients;

        (6) Ensure the criteria for selection are individual character, competence, training, experience, and judgment; and

        (7) Ensure that under no circumstances is the accordance of staff membership or professional privileges in the hospital dependent solely upon certification, fellowship, or membership in a specialty body or society.

        (8) Ensure that, when telemedicine services are furnished to the hospital's patients through an agreement with a distant-site hospital, the agreement is written and that it specifies that it is the responsibility of the governing body of the distant-site hospital to meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section with regard to the distant-site hospital's physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services. The governing body of the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services may, in accordance with § 482.22(a)(3) of this part, grant privileges based on its medical staff recommendations that rely on information provided by the distant-site hospital.

        (9) Ensure that when telemedicine services are furnished to the hospital's patients through an agreement with a distant-site telemedicine entity, the written agreement specifies that the distant-site telemedicine entity is a contractor of services to the hospital and as such, in accordance with § 482.12(e), furnishes the contracted services in a manner that permits the hospital to comply with all applicable conditions of participation for the contracted services, including, but not limited to, the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section with regard to the distant-site telemedicine entity's physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services. The governing body of the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services may, in accordance with § 482.22(a)(4) of this part, grant privileges to physicians and practitioners employed by the distant-site telemedicine entity based on such hospital's medical staff recommendations; such staff recommendations may rely on information provided by the distant-site telemedicine entity.

        (10) Consult directly with the individual assigned the responsibility for the organization and conduct of the hospital's medical staff, or his or her designee. At a minimum, this direct consultation must occur periodically throughout the fiscal or calendar year and include discussion of matters related to the quality of medical care provided to patients of the hospital. For a multi-hospital system using a single governing body, the single multi-hospital system governing body must consult directly with the individual responsible for the organized medical staff (or his or her designee) of each hospital within its system in addition to the other requirements of this paragraph (a).

        (b)  The governing body must appoint a chief executive officer who is responsible for managing the hospital.

        (c)  In accordance with hospital policy, the governing body must ensure that the following requirements are met:

        (1) Every Medicare patient is under the care of:

        (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (This provision is not to be construed to limit the authority of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy to delegate tasks to other qualified health care personnel to the extent recognized under State law or a State's regulatory mechanism.);

        (ii) A doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine who is legally authorized to practice dentistry by the State and who is acting within the scope of his or her license;

        (iii) A doctor of podiatric medicine, but only with respect to functions which he or she is legally authorized by the State to perform;

        (vi) A clinical psychologist as defined in § 410.71 of this chapter, but only with respect to clinical psychologist services as defined in § 410.71 of this chapter and only to the extent permitted by State law.

        (2) Patients are admitted to the hospital only on the recommendation of a licensed practitioner permitted by the State to admit patients to a hospital. If a Medicare patient is admitted by a practitioner not specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that patient is under the care of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.

        (3) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy is on duty or on call at all times.

        (4) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy is responsible for the care of each Medicare patient with respect to any medical or psychiatric problem that—

        (i) is present on admission or develops during hospitalization; and

        (1) The plan must include an annual operating budget that is prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles.

        (2) The budget must include all anticipated income and expenses. This provision does not require that the budget identify item by item the components of each anticipated income or expense.

        (3) The plan must provide for capital expenditures for at least a 3-year period, including the year in which the operating budget specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is applicable.

        (4) The plan must include and identify in detail the objective of, and the anticipated sources of financing for, each anticipated capital expenditure in excess of $600,000 (or a lesser amount that is established, in accordance with section 1122(g)(1) of the Act, by the State in which the hospital is located) that relates to any of the following:

        (i) Acquisition of land;

        (ii) Improvement of land, buildings, and equipment; or

        (iii) The replacement, modernization, and expansion of buildings and equipment.

        (5) The plan must be submitted for review to the planning agency designated in accordance with section 1122(b) of the Act, or if an agency is not designated, to the appropriate health planning agency in the State. (See part 100 of this title.)

        (6) The plan must be reviewed and updated annually.

        (7) The plan must be prepared—

        (i) Under the direction of the governing body; and

        (ii) By a committee consisting of representatives of the governing body, the administrative staff, and the medical staff of the institution.

        (2) The hospital must establish a process for prompt resolution of patient grievances and must inform each patient whom to contact to file a grievance. The hospital's governing body must approve and be responsible for the effective operation of the grievance process and must review and resolve grievances, unless it delegates the responsibility in writing to a grievance committee. The grievance process must include a mechanism for timely referral of patient concerns regarding quality of care or premature discharge to the appropriate Utilization and Quality Control Quality Improvement Organization. At a minimum:

        (i) The hospital must establish a clearly explained procedure for the submission of a patient's written or verbal grievance to the hospital.

        (b)  (1) The patient has the right to participate in the development and implementation of his or her plan of care.

        (2) The patient or his or her representative (as allowed under State law) has the right to make informed decisions regarding his or her care. The patient's rights include being informed of his or her health status, being involved in care planning and treatment, and being able to request or refuse treatment. This right must not be construed as a mechanism to demand the provision of treatment or services deemed medically unnecessary or inappropriate.

        (3) The patient has the right to formulate advance directives and to have hospital staff and practitioners who provide care in the hospital comply with these directives, in accordance with § 489.100 of this part (Definition), § 489.102 of this part (Requirements for providers), and § 489.104 of this part (Effective dates).

The hospital must not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their own medical records and must actively seek to meet these requests as quickly as its record keeping system permits.

        (e)  All patients have the right to be free from physical or mental abuse, and corporal punishment. All patients have the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff.

        (C) A restraint does not include devices, such as orthopedically prescribed devices, surgical dressings or bandages, protective helmets, or other methods that involve the physical holding of a patient for the purpose of conducting routine physical examinations or tests, or to protect the patient from falling out of bed, or to permit the patient to participate in activities without the risk of physical harm (this does not include a physical escort).

        (ii)  is the involuntary confinement of a patient alone in a room or area from which the patient is physically prevented from leaving. _Seclusion_ may only be used for the management of violent or self-destructive behavior.

        (2) Restraint or seclusion may only be used when less restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective to protect the patient a staff member or others from harm.

        (3) The type or technique of restraint or seclusion used must be the least restrictive intervention that will be effective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm.

        (4) The use of restraint or seclusion must be—

        (i) In accordance with a written modification to the patient's plan of care; and

        (ii) Implemented in accordance with safe and appropriate restraint and seclusion techniques as determined by hospital policy in accordance with State law.

        (C) 1 hour for children under 9 years of age; and

        (ii) After 24 hours, before writing a new order for the use of restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self-destructive behavior, a physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient and authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law must see and assess the patient.

        (iii) Each order for restraint used to ensure the physical safety of the non-violent or non-self-destructive patient may be renewed as authorized by hospital policy.

        (9) Restraint or seclusion must be discontinued at the earliest possible time, regardless of the length of time identified in the order.

        (10) The condition of the patient who is restrained or secluded must be monitored by a physician, other licensed practitioner, or trained staff that have completed the training criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section at an interval determined by hospital policy.

At a minimum, physicians and other licensed practitioners authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law must have a working knowledge of hospital policy regarding the use of restraint or seclusion.

        (12) When restraint or seclusion is used for the management of violent or self-destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others, the patient must be seen face-to-face within 1 hour after the initiation of the intervention—

        (i) By a—

        (A) Physician or other licensed practitioner.

        (15) All requirements specified under this paragraph are applicable to the simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion. Simultaneous restraint and seclusion use is only permitted if the patient is continually monitored—

        (i) Face-to-face by an assigned, trained staff member; or

        (ii) By trained staff using both video and audio equipment. This monitoring must be in close proximity to the patient.

        (g)  Hospitals must report deaths associated with the use of seclusion or restraint.

        (1) With the exception of deaths described under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the hospital must report the following information to CMS by telephone, facsimile, or electronically, as determined by CMS, no later than the close of business on the next business day following knowledge of the patient's death:

        (i) Each death that occurs while a patient is in restraint or seclusion.

        (ii) Each death that occurs within 24 hours after the patient has been removed from restraint or seclusion.

        (iii) Each death known to the hospital that occurs within 1 week after restraint or seclusion where it is reasonable to assume that use of restraint or placement in seclusion contributed directly or indirectly to a patient's death, regardless of the type(s) of restraint used on the patient during this time. “Reasonable to assume” in this context includes, but is not limited to, deaths related to restrictions of movement for prolonged periods of time, or death related to chest compression, restriction of breathing, or asphyxiation.

        (2) When no seclusion has been used and when the only restraints used on the patient are those applied exclusively to the patient's wrist(s), and which are composed solely of soft, non-rigid, cloth-like materials, the hospital staff must record in an internal log or other system, the following information:

        § 482.43   Condition of participation: Discharge planning.

#### § § 482.43

        The hospital must have an effective discharge planning process that focuses on the patient's goals and treatment preferences and includes the patient and his or her caregivers/support person(s) as active partners in the discharge planning for post-discharge care. The discharge planning process and the discharge plan must be consistent with the patient's goals for care and his or her treatment preferences, ensure an effective transition of the patient from hospital to post-discharge care, and reduce the factors leading to preventable hospital readmissions.

        (a)  The hospital's discharge planning process must identify, at an early stage of hospitalization, those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge in the absence of adequate discharge planning and must provide a discharge planning evaluation for those patients so identified as well as for other patients upon the request of the patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.

        (1) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for post-hospital care will be made before discharge and to avoid unnecessary delays in discharge.

        (2) A discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate post-hospital services, including, but not limited to, hospice care services, post-hospital extended care services, home health services, and non-health care services and community based care providers, and must also include a determination of the availability of the appropriate services as well as of the patient's access to those services.

        (3) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in the patient's medical record for use in establishing an appropriate discharge plan and the results of the evaluation must be discussed with the patient (or the patient's representative).

        (4) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the hospital must arrange for the development and initial implementation of a discharge plan for the patient.

        (5) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan required under this paragraph must be developed by, or under the supervision of, a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified personnel.

        (6) The hospital's discharge planning process must require regular re-evaluation of the patient's condition to identify changes that require modification of the discharge plan. The discharge plan must be updated, as needed, to reflect these changes.

        (7) The hospital must assess its discharge planning process on a regular basis. The assessment must include ongoing, periodic review of a representative sample of discharge plans, including those patients who were readmitted within 30 days of a previous admission, to ensure that the plans are responsive to patient post-discharge needs.

        (8) The hospital must assist patients, their families, or the patient's representative in selecting a post-acute care provider by using and sharing data that includes, but is not limited to, HHA, SNF, IRF, or LTCH data on quality measures and data on resource use measures. The hospital must ensure that the post-acute care data on quality measures and data on resource use measures is relevant and applicable to the patient's goals of care and treatment preferences.

        (b)  The hospital must discharge the patient, and also transfer or refer the patient where applicable, along with all necessary medical information pertaining to the patient's current course of illness and treatment, post-discharge goals of care, and treatment preferences, at the time of discharge, to the appropriate post-acute care service providers and suppliers, facilities, agencies, and other outpatient service providers and practitioners responsible for the patient's follow-up or ancillary care.

        (c)  Effective July 1, 2025, the hospital must have written policies and procedures for transferring patients under its care (inclusive of inpatient services) to the appropriate level of care (including to another hospital) as needed to meet the needs of the patient. The hospital must also provide annual training to relevant staff regarding the hospital policies and procedures for transferring patients under its care.

        (d)  For those patients discharged home and referred for HHA services, or for those patients transferred to a SNF for post-hospital extended care services, or transferred to an IRF or LTCH for specialized hospital services, the following requirements apply, in addition to those set out at paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

        (1) The hospital must include in the discharge plan a list of HHAs, SNFs, IRFs, or LTCHs that are available to the patient, that are participating in the Medicare program, and that serve the geographic area (as defined by the HHA) in which the patient resides, or in the case of a SNF, IRF, or LTCH, in the geographic area requested by the patient. HHAs must request to be listed by the hospital as available.

        (i) This list must only be presented to patients for whom home health care post-hospital extended care services, SNF, IRF, or LTCH services are indicated and appropriate as determined by the discharge planning evaluation.

        (ii) For patients enrolled in managed care organizations, the hospital must make the patient aware of the need to verify with their managed care organization which practitioners, providers or certified suppliers are in the managed care organization's network. If the hospital has information on which practitioners, providers or certified supplies are in the network of the patient's managed care organization, it must share this with the patient or the patient's representative.

        (iii) The hospital must document in the patient's medical record that the list was presented to the patient or to the patient's representative.

        (2) The hospital, as part of the discharge planning process, must inform the patient or the patient's representative of their freedom to choose among participating Medicare providers and suppliers of post-discharge services and must, when possible, respect the patient's or the patient's representative's goals of care and treatment preferences, as well as other preferences they express. The hospital must not specify or otherwise limit the qualified providers or suppliers that are available to the patient.

        § 482.45   Condition of participation: Organ, tissue, and eye procurement.

#### § § 482.45

        (a)  The hospital must have and implement written protocols that:

        (1) Incorporate an agreement with an OPO designated under part 486 of this chapter, under which it must notify, in a timely manner, the OPO or a third party designated by the OPO of individuals whose death is imminent or who have died in the hospital. The OPO determines medical suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the hospital, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the hospital for this purpose;

        (2) Incorporate an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be appropriate to assure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with organ procurement;

        (3) Ensure, in collaboration with the designated OPO, that the family of each potential donor is informed of its options to donate organs, tissues, or eyes or to decline to donate. The individual designated by the hospital to initiate the request to the family must be an organ procurement representative or a designated requestor. A designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community in the methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation;

        (4) Encourage discretion and sensitivity with respect to the circumstances, views, and beliefs of the families of potential donors;

        (5) Ensure that the hospital works cooperatively with the designated OPO, tissue bank and eye bank in educating staff on donation issues, reviewing death records to improve identification of potential donors, and maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes take place.

        (b)  (1) A hospital in which organ transplants are performed must be a member of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) established and operated in accordance with section 372 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 274) and abide by its rules. The term “rules of the OPTN” means those rules provided for in regulations issued by the Secretary in accordance with section 372 of the PHS Act which are enforceable under 42 CFR 121.10. No hospital is considered to be out of compliance with section 1138(a)(1)(B) of the Act, or with the requirements of this paragraph, unless the Secretary has given the OPTN formal notice that he or she approves the decision to exclude the hospital from the OPTN and has notified the hospital in writing.

        (2) For purposes of these standards, the term “organ” means a human kidney, liver, heart, lung, or pancreas.

        (3) If a hospital performs any type of transplants, it must provide organ-transplant-related data, as requested by the OPTN, the Scientific Registry, and the OPOs. The hospital must also provide such data directly to the Department when requested by the Secretary.

          A transplant center that seeks Medicare approval to provide transplantation services to pediatric patients must submit to CMS a request specifically for Medicare approval to perform pediatric transplants using the procedures described at § 488.61 of this chapter.

          (a) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, a center requesting Medicare approval to perform pediatric transplants must meet all the conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.74 and §§ 482.80 through 482.104 with respect to its pediatric patients.

          (b) A center that performs 50 percent or more of its transplants in a 12-month period on adult patients must be approved to perform adult transplants in order to be approved to perform pediatric transplants.

          (1) Loss of Medicare approval to perform adult transplants, whether voluntary or involuntary, will result in loss of the center's approval to perform pediatric transplants.

          (2) Loss of Medicare approval to perform pediatric transplants, whether voluntary or involuntary, may trigger a review of the center's Medicare approval to perform adult transplants.

          (c) A center that performs 50 percent or more of its transplants in a 12-month period on pediatric patients must be approved to perform pediatric transplants in order to be approved to perform adult transplants.

          (1) Loss of Medicare approval to perform pediatric transplants, whether voluntary or involuntary, will result in loss of the center's approval to perform adult transplants.

          (2) Loss of Medicare approval to perform adult transplants, whether voluntary or involuntary, may trigger a review of the center's Medicare approval to perform pediatric transplants.

          (3) A center that performs 50 percent or more of its transplants on pediatric patients in a 12-month period is not required to meet the clinical experience requirements prior to its request for approval as a pediatric transplant center.

          (d) Instead of meeting all conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.74 and §§ 482.80 through 482.104, a heart transplant center that wishes to provide transplantation services to pediatric heart patients may be approved to perform pediatric heart transplants by meeting the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 criteria in section 4009(b) (Pub. L. 100-203), as follows:

          (1) The center's pediatric transplant program must be operated jointly by the hospital and another facility that is Medicare-approved;

          (2) The unified program shares the same transplant surgeons and quality improvement program (including oversight committee, patient protocol, and patient selection criteria); and

          (3) The center demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is able to provide the specialized facilities, services, and personnel that are required by pediatric heart transplant patients.

          § 482.78   Condition of participation: Emergency preparedness for transplant programs.

#### § § 482.78

          A transplant program must be included in the emergency preparedness planning and the emergency preparedness program as set forth in § 482.15 for the hospital in which it is located. However, a transplant program is not individually responsible for the emergency preparedness requirements set forth in § 482.15.

          (a)  A transplant program must have policies and procedures that address emergency preparedness. These policies and procedures must be included in the hospital's emergency preparedness program.

          (b)  A transplant program must develop and maintain mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant program, the hospital in which the transplant program is operated, and the OPO designated by the Secretary, unless the hospital has an approved waiver to work with another OPO, during an emergency.

        (v) A single institution can have a maximum of only one distinct part SNF and one distinct part NF.

        (vi) (A) An institution cannot designate a distinct part SNF or NF, but instead must submit a written request with documentation that demonstrates it meets the criteria set forth above to CMS to determine if it may be considered a distinct part.

        (B) The effective date of approval of a distinct part is the date that CMS determines all requirements (including enrollment with the fiscal intermediary (FI)) are met for approval, and cannot be made retroactive.

        (C) The institution must request approval from CMS for all proposed changes in the number of beds in the approved distinct part.

        (4) In the case of a person eligible for Medicaid, a nursing facility must not charge, solicit, accept, or receive, in addition to any amount otherwise required to be paid under the State plan, any gift, money, donation, or other consideration as a precondition of admission, expedited admission or continued stay in the facility. However,—

        (i) A nursing facility may charge a resident who is eligible for Medicaid for items and services the resident has requested and received, and that are not specified in the State plan as included in the term “nursing facility services” so long as the facility gives proper notice of the availability and cost of these services to residents and does not condition the resident's admission or continued stay on the request for and receipt of such additional services; and

        (ii) A nursing facility may solicit, accept, or receive a charitable, religious, or philanthropic contribution from an organization or from a person unrelated to a Medicaid eligible resident or potential resident, but only to the extent that the contribution is not a condition of admission, expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility for a Medicaid eligible resident.

        (A) The transfer or discharge is necessary for the resident's welfare and the resident's needs cannot be met in the facility;

        (B) The transfer or discharge is appropriate because the resident's health has improved sufficiently so the resident no longer needs the services provided by the facility;

        (F) The facility ceases to operate.

        (ii) The facility may not transfer or discharge the resident while the appeal is pending, pursuant to § 431.230 of this chapter, when a resident exercises his or her right to appeal a transfer or discharge notice from the facility pursuant to § 431.220(a)(3) of this chapter, unless the failure to discharge or transfer would endanger the health or safety of the resident or other individuals in the facility.

        (2) Assignment of specific individuals within the high-level personnel of the operating organization with the overall responsibility to oversee compliance with the operating organization's compliance and ethics program's standards, policies, and procedures, such as, but not limited to, the chief executive officer (CEO), members of the board of directors, or directors of major divisions in the operating organization.

        (3) Sufficient resources and authority to the specific individuals designated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to reasonably assure compliance with such standards, policies, and procedures.

        (4) Due care not to delegate substantial discretionary authority to individuals who the operating organization knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, had a propensity to engage in criminal, civil, and administrative violations under the Social Security Act.

        (5) The facility takes steps to effectively communicate the standards, policies, and procedures in the operating organization's compliance and ethics program to the operating organization's entire staff; individuals providing services under a contractual arrangement; and volunteers, consistent with the volunteers' expected roles. Requirements include, but are not limited to, mandatory participation in training as set forth at § 483.95(f) or orientation programs, or disseminating information that explains in a practical manner what is required under the program.

        (6) The facility takes reasonable steps to achieve compliance with the program's standards, policies, and procedures. Such steps include, but are not limited to, utilizing monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal, civil, and administrative violations under the Act by any of the operating organization's staff, individuals providing services under a contractual arrangement, or volunteers, having in place and publicizing a reporting system whereby any of these individuals could report violations by others anonymously within the operating organization without fear of retribution, and having a process for ensuring the integrity of any reported data.

        (7) Consistent enforcement of the operating organization's standards, policies, and procedures through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate, discipline of individuals responsible for the failure to detect and report a violation to the compliance and ethics program contact identified in the operating organization's compliance and ethics program.

        (8) After a violation is detected, the operating organization must ensure that all reasonable steps identified in its program are taken to respond appropriately to the violation and to prevent further similar violations, including any necessary modification to the operating organization's program to prevent and detect criminal, civil, and administrative violations under the Act.

        (d)  In addition to all of the other requirements in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section, operating organizations that operate five or more facilities must also include, at a minimum, the following components in their compliance and ethics program:

        (1) A mandatory annual training program on the operating organization's compliance and ethics program that meets the requirements set forth in § 483.95(f).

        (2) A designated compliance officer for whom the operating organization's compliance and ethics program is a major responsibility. This individual must report directly to the operating organization's governing body and not be subordinate to the general counsel, chief financial officer or chief operating officer.

        (3) Designated compliance liaisons located at each of the operating organization's facilities.

        (e)  The operating organization for each facility must review its compliance and ethics program annually and revise its program as needed to reflect changes in all applicable laws or regulations and within the operating organization and its facilities to improve its performance in deterring, reducing, and detecting violations under the Act and in promoting quality of care.

#### § § 483.100

        The requirements of §§ 483.100 through 483.138 governing the State's responsibility for preadmission screening and annual resident review (PASARR) of individuals with mental illness and intellectual disability are based on section 1919(e)(7) of the Act.

        § 483.102   Applicability and definitions.

#### § § 483.102

        (a) This subpart applies to the screening or reviewing of all individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability who apply to or reside in Medicaid certified NFs regardless of the source of payment for the NF services, and regardless of the individual's or resident's known diagnoses.

        (b)  As used in this subpart—

        (1) An individual is considered to have a serious mental illness (MI) if the individual meets the following requirements on diagnosis, level of impairment and duration of illness:

        (i)  The individual has a major mental disorder diagnosable under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised in 1987.

        Incorporation of the 1987 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 that govern the use of incorporation by reference.

        This mental disorder is—

        (A) A schizophrenic, mood, paranoid, panic or other severe anxiety disorder; somatoform disorder; personality disorder; other psychotic disorder; or another mental disorder that may lead to a chronic disability; but

        (B) Not a primary diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder, or a non-primary diagnosis of dementia unless the primary diagnosis is a major mental disorder as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

        (ii)  The disorder results in functional limitations in major life activities within the past 3 to 6 months that would be appropriate for the individual's developmental stage. An individual typically has at least one of the following characteristics on a continuing or intermittent basis:

        (A)  The individual has serious difficulty interacting appropriately and communicating effectively with other persons, has a possible history of altercations, evictions, firing, fear of strangers, avoidance of interpersonal relationships and social isolation;

        (B)  The individual has serious difficulty in sustaining focused attention for a long enough period to permit the completion of tasks commonly found in work settings or in work-like structured activities occurring in school or home settings, manifests difficulties in concentration, inability to complete simple tasks within an established time period, makes frequent errors, or requires assistance in the completion of these tasks; and

        (C)  The individual has serious difficulty in adapting to typical changes in circumstances associated with work, school, family, or social interaction, manifests agitation, exacerbated signs and symptoms associated with the illness, or withdrawal from the situation, or requires intervention by the mental health or judicial system.

        (iii)  The treatment history indicates that the individual has experienced at least one of the following:

        (A) Psychiatric treatment more intensive than outpatient care more than once in the past 2 years (e.g., partial hospitalization or inpatient hospitalization); or

        (B) Within the last 2 years, due to the mental disorder, experienced an episode of significant disruption to the normal living situation, for which supportive services were required to maintain functioning at home, or in a residential treatment environment, or which resulted in intervention by housing or law enforcement officials.

        (2) An individual is considered to have dementia if he or she has a primary diagnosis of dementia, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised in 1987, or a non-primary diagnosis of dementia unless the primary diagnosis is a major mental disorder as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

        (3) An individual is considered to have intellectual disability (IID) if he or she has—

        (i) A level of retardation (mild, moderate, severe or profound) described in the American Association on Intellectual Disability's Manual on Classification in Intellectual Disability (1983). Incorporation by reference of the 1983 edition of the American Association on Intellectual Disability's Manual on Classification in Intellectual Disability was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 that govern the use of incorporations by reference;  or

        (ii) A related condition as defined by § 435.1010 of this chapter.

> [57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992; 58 FR 25784, Apr. 28, 1993; 71 FR 39229, July 12, 2006]

        § 483.104   State plan requirement.

#### § § 483.104

        As a condition of approval of the State plan, the State must operate a preadmission screening and annual resident review program that meets the requirements of §§ 483.100 through 438.138.

        § 483.106   Basic rule.

#### § § 483.106

        (a)  The State PASARR program must require—(1) Preadmission screening of all individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability who apply as new admissions to Medicaid NFs on or after January 1, 1989;

        (2) Initial review, by April 1, 1990, of all current residents with intellectual disability or mental illness who entered Medicaid NFs prior to January 1, 1989; and

        (3) At least annual review, as of April 1, 1990, of all residents with mental illness or intellectual disability, regardless of whether they were first screened under the preadmission screening or annual resident review requirements.

        (b) —(1)  An individual is a new admission if he or she is admitted to any NF for the first time or does not qualify as a readmission. With the exception of certain hospital discharges described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, new admissions are subject to preadmission screening.

        (2)  (i) An exempted hospital discharge means an individual—

        (A) Who is admitted to any NF directly from a hospital after receiving acute inpatient care at the hospital;

        (B) Who requires NF services for the condition for which he or she received care in the hospital; and

        (C) Whose attending physician has certified before admission to the facility that the individual is likely to require less than 30 days nursing facility services.

        (ii) If an individual who enters a NF as an exempted hospital discharge is later found to require more than 30 days of NF care, the State mental health or intellectual disability authority must conduct an annual resident review within 40 calendar days of admission.

        (3)  An individual is a readmission if he or she was readmitted to a facility from a hospital to which he or she was transferred for the purpose of receiving care. Readmissions are subject to annual resident review rather than preadmission screening.

        (4) —(i) An interfacility transfer occurs when an individual is transferred from one NF to another NF, with or without an intervening hospital stay. _Interfacility transfers_ are subject to annual resident review rather than preadmission screening.

        (ii) In cases of transfer of a resident with MI or IID from a NF to a hospital or to another NF, the transferring NF is responsible for ensuring that copies of the resident's most recent PASARR and resident assessment reports accompany the transferring resident.

        (c)  The preadmission screening and annual resident review process must result in determinations based on a physical and mental evaluation of each individual with mental illness or intellectual disability, that are described in §§ 483.112 and 483.114.

        (d)  The PASARR determinations of whether an individual requires the level of services provided by a NF and whether specialized services are needed—

        (1) For individuals with mental illness, must be made by the State mental health authority and be based on an independent physical and mental evaluation performed by a person or entity other than the State mental health authority; and

        (2) For individuals with intellectual disability, must be made by the State intellectual disability or developmental disabilities authority.

        (e) —(1) The State mental health and intellectual disability authorities may delegate by subcontract or otherwise the evaluation and determination functions for which they are responsible to another entity only if—

        (i) The State mental health and intellectual disability authorities retain ultimate control and responsibility for the performance of their statutory obligations;

        (ii) The two determinations as to the need for NF services and for specialized services are made, based on a consistent analysis of the data; and

        (iii) The entity to which the delegation is made is not a NF or an entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with a NF.

        (2) The State intellectual disability authority has responsibility for both the evaluation and determination functions for individuals with IID whereas the State mental health authority has responsibility only for the determination function.

        (3) The evaluation of individuals with MI cannot be delegated by the State mental health authority because it does not have responsibility for this function. The evaluation function must be performed by a person or entity other than the State mental health authority. In designating an independent person or entity to perform MI evaluations, the State must not use a NF or an entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with a NF.

        § 483.108   Relationship of PASARR to other Medicaid processes.

#### § § 483.108

        (a) PASARR determinations made by the State mental health or intellectual disability authorities cannot be countermanded by the State Medicaid agency, either in the claims process or through other utilization control/review processes or by the State survey and certification agency. Only appeals determinations made through the system specified in subpart E of this part may overturn a PASARR determination made by the State mental health or intellectual disability authorities.

        (b) In making their determinations, however, the State mental health and intellectual disability authorities must not use criteria relating to the need for NF care or specialized services that are inconsistent with this regulation and any supplementary criteria adopted by the State Medicaid agency under its approved State plan.

        (c) To the maximum extent practicable, in order to avoid duplicative testing and effort, the PASARR must be coordinated with the routine resident assessments required by § 483.20(b).

        § 483.110   Out-of-State arrangements.

#### § § 483.110

        (a)  The State in which the individual is a State resident (or would be a State resident at the time he or she becomes eligible for Medicaid), as defined in § 435.403 of this chapter, must pay for the PASARR and make the required determinations, in accordance with § 431.52(b).

        (b)  A State may include arrangements for PASARR in its provider agreements with out-of-State facilities or reciprocal interstate agreements.

        § 483.112   Preadmission screening of applicants for admission to NFs.

#### § § 483.112

        (a)  For each NF applicant with MI or IID, the State mental health or intellectual disability authority (as appropriate) must determine, in accordance with § 483.130, whether, because of the resident's physical and mental condition, the individual requires the level of services provided by a NF.

        (b)  If the individual with mental illness or intellectual disability is determined to require a NF level of care, the State mental health or intellectual disability authority (as appropriate) must also determine, in accordance with § 483.130, whether the individual requires specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability, as defined in § 483.120.

        (c) —(1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a preadmission screening determination must be made in writing within an annual average of 7 to 9 working days of referral of the individual with MI or IID by whatever agent performs the Level I identification, under § 483.128(a) of this part, to the State mental health or intellectual disability authority for screening. (See § 483.128(a) for discussion of Level I evaluation.)

        (2) The State may convey determinations verbally to nursing facilities and the individual and confirm them in writing.

        (3) The State may compute separate annual averages for the mentally ill and individuals with intellectual disabilities/developmentally disabled populations.

        (4) The Secretary may grant an exception to the timeliness standard in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when the State—

        (i) Exceeds the annual average; and

        (ii) Provides justification satisfactory to the Secretary that a longer time period was necessary.

        § 483.114   Annual review of NF residents.

#### § § 483.114

        (a)  For each resident of a NF who has mental illness, the State mental health authority must determine in accordance with § 483.130 whether, because of the resident's physical and mental condition, the resident requires—

        (1) The level of services provided by—

        (i) A NF;

        (ii) An inpatient psychiatric hospital for individuals under age 21, as described in section 1905(h) of the Act; or

        (iii) An institution for mental diseases providing medical assistance to individuals age 65 or older; and

        (2) Specialized services for mental illness, as defined in § 483.120.

        (b)  For each resident of a NF who has intellectual disability, the State intellectual disability or developmental disability authority must determine in accordance with § 483.130 whether, because of his or her physical or mental condition, the resident requires—

        (1) The level of services provided by a NF or an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities; and

        (2) Specialized services for intellectual disability as defined in § 483.120.

        (c) —(1) A review and determination must be conducted for each resident of a Medicaid NF who has mental illness or intellectual disability not less often than annually.

        (2) “Annually” is defined as occurring within every fourth quarter after the previous preadmission screen or annual resident review.

        (d)  The first set of annual reviews on residents who entered the NF prior to January 1, 1989, must be completed by April 1, 1990.

        § 483.116   Residents and applicants determined to require NF level of services.

#### § § 483.116

        (a)  If the State mental health or intellectual disability authority determines that a resident or applicant for admission to a NF requires a NF level of services, the NF may admit or retain the individual.

        (b)  If the State mental health or intellectual disability authority determines that a resident or applicant for admission requires both a NF level of services and specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability—

        (1) The NF may admit or retain the individual; and

        (2) The State must provide or arrange for the provision of the specialized services needed by the individual while he or she resides in the NF.

        § 483.118   Residents and applicants determined not to require NF level of services.

#### § § 483.118

        (a)  If the State mental health or intellectual disability authority determines that an applicant for admission to a NF does not require NF services, the applicant cannot be admitted. NF services are not a covered Medicaid service for that individual, and further screening is not required.

        (b)  If the State mental health or intellectual disability authority determines that a resident requires neither the level of services provided by a NF nor specialized services for MI or IID, regardless of the length of stay in the facility, the State must—

        (1) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility in accordance with § 483.15(b); and

        (2) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge.

        (c) —(1)  Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, for any resident who has continuously resided in a NF for at least 30 months before the date of the determination, and who requires only specialized services as defined in § 483.120, the State must, in consultation with the resident's family or legal representative and caregivers—

        (i) Offer the resident the choice of remaining in the facility or of receiving services in an alternative appropriate setting;

        (ii) Inform the resident of the institutional and noninstitutional alternatives covered under the State Medicaid plan for the resident;

        (iii) Clarify the effect on eligibility for Medicaid services under the State plan if the resident chooses to leave the facility, including its effect on readmission to the facility; and

        (iv) Regardless of the resident's choice, provide for, or arrange for the provision of specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability.

        (2)  Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, for any resident who requires only specialized services, as defined in § 483.120, and who has not continuously resided in a NF for at least 30 months before the date of the determination, the State must, in consultation with the resident's family or legal representative and caregivers—

        (i) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility in accordance with § 483.15(b);

        (ii) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge; and

        (iii) Provide for, or arrange for the provision of, specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability.

        (3) For the purpose of establishing length of stay in a NF, the 30 months of continuous residence in a NF or longer—

        (i) Is calculated back from the date of the first annual resident review determination which finds that the individual is not in need of NF level of services;

        (ii) May include temporary absences for hospitalization or therapeutic leave; and

        (iii) May consist of consecutive residences in more than one NF.

        § 483.120   Specialized services.

#### § § 483.120

        (a) —(1) For mental illness, specialized services means the services specified by the State which, combined with services provided by the NF, results in the continuous and aggressive implementation of an individualized plan of care that—

        (i) Is developed and supervised by an interdisciplinary team, which includes a physician, qualified mental health professionals and, as appropriate, other professionals.

        (ii) Prescribes specific therapies and activities for the treatment of persons experiencing an acute episode of serious mental illness, which necessitates supervision by trained mental health personnel; and

        (iii) Is directed toward diagnosing and reducing the resident's behavioral symptoms that necessitated institutionalization, improving his or her level of independent functioning, and achieving a functioning level that permits reduction in the intensity of mental health services to below the level of specialized services at the earliest possible time.

        (2) For intellectual disability, specialized services means the services specified by the State which, combined with services provided by the NF or other service providers, results in treatment which meets the requirements of § 483.440(a)(1).

        (b)  The State must provide or arrange for the provision of specialized services, in accordance with this subpart, to all NF residents with MI or IID whose needs are such that continuous supervision, treatment and training by qualified mental health or intellectual disability personnel is necessary, as identified by the screening provided in § 483.130 or §§ 483.134 and 483.136.

        (c)  The NF must provide mental health or intellectual disability services which are of a lesser intensity than specialized services to all residents who need such services.

        § 483.122   FFP for NF services.

#### § § 483.122

        (a)  Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, FFP is available in State expenditures for NF services provided to a Medicaid eligible individual subject to the requirements of this part only if the individual has been determined—

        (1) To need NF care under § 483.116(a) or

        (2) Not to need NF services but to need specialized services, meets the requirements of § 483.118(c)(1), and elects to stay in the NF.

        (b)  When a preadmission screening has not been performed prior to admission or an annual review is not performed timely, in accordance with § 483.114(c), but either is performed at a later date, FFP is available only for services furnished after the screening or review has been performed, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 483.124   FFP for specialized services.

#### § § 483.124

        FFP is not available for specialized services furnished to NF residents as NF services.

        § 483.126   Appropriate placement.

#### § § 483.126

        Placement of an individual with MI or IID in a NF may be considered appropriate only when the individual's needs are such that he or she meets the minimum standards for admission and the individual's needs for treatment do not exceed the level of services which can be delivered in the NF to which the individual is admitted either through NF services alone or, where necessary, through NF services supplemented by specialized services provided by or arranged for by the State.

        § 483.128   PASARR evaluation criteria.

#### § § 483.128

        (a)  The State's PASARR program must identify all individuals who are suspected of having MI or IID as defined in § 483.102. This identification function is termed Level I. Level II is the function of evaluating and determining whether NF services and specialized services are needed. The State's performance of the Level I identification function must provide at least, in the case of first time identifications, for the issuance of written notice to the individual or resident and his or her legal representative that the individual or resident is suspected of having MI or IID and is being referred to the State mental health or intellectual disability authority for Level II screening.

        (b)  Evaluations performed under PASARR and PASARR notices must be adapted to the cultural background, language, ethnic origin and means of communication used by the individual being evaluated.

        (c)  PASARR evaluations must involve—

        (1) The individual being evaluated;

        (2) The individual's legal representative, if one has been designated under State law; and

        (3) The individual's family if—

        (i) Available; and

        (ii) The individual or the legal representative agrees to family participation.

        (d)  When parts of a PASARR evaluation are performed by more than one evaluator, the State must ensure that there is interdisciplinary coordination among the evaluators.

        (e) The State's PASARR program must use at least the evaluative criteria of § 483.130 (if one or both determinations can easily be made categorically as described in § 483.130) or of §§ 483.132 and 483.134 or § 483.136 (or, in the case of individuals with both MI and IID, §§ 483.132, 483.134 and 483.136 if a more extensive individualized evaluation is required).

        (f)  In the case of individualized evaluations, information that is necessary for determining whether it is appropriate for the individual with MI or IID to be placed in an NF or in another appropriate setting should be gathered throughout all applicable portions of the PASARR evaluation (§§ 483.132 and 483.134 and/or § 483.136). The two determinations relating to the need for NF level of care and specialized services are interrelated and must be based upon a comprehensive analysis of all data concerning the individual.

        (g)  Evaluators may use relevant evaluative data, obtained prior to initiation of preadmission screening or annual resident review, if the data are considered valid and accurate and reflect the current functional status of the individual. However, in the case of individualized evaluations, to supplement and verify the currency and accuracy of existing data, the State's PASARR program may need to gather additional information necessary to assess proper placement and treatment.

        (h)  For both categorical and individualized determinations, findings of the evaluation must correspond to the person's current functional status as documented in medical and social history records.

        (i)  For individualized PASARR determinations, findings must be issued in the form of a written evaluative report which—

        (1) Identifies the name and professional title of person(s) who performed the evaluation(s) and the date on which each portion of the evaluation was administered;

        (2) Provides a summary of the medical and social history, including the positive traits or developmental strengths and weaknesses or developmental needs of the evaluated individual;

        (3) If NF services are recommended, identifies the specific services which are required to meet the evaluated individual's needs, including services required in paragraph (i)(5) of this section;

        (4) If specialized services are not recommended, identifies any specific intellectual disability or mental health services which are of a lesser intensity than specialized services that are required to meet the evaluated individual's needs;

        (5) If specialized services are recommended, identifies the specific intellectual disability or mental health services required to meet the evaluated individual's needs; and

        (6) Includes the bases for the report's conclusions.

        (j)  For categorical PASARR determinations, findings must be issued in the form of an abbreviated written evaluative report which—

        (1) Identifies the name and professional title of the person applying the categorical determination and the data on which the application was made;

        (2) Explains the categorical determination(s) that has (have) been made and, if only one of the two required determinations can be made categorically, describes the nature of any further screening which is required;

        (3) Identifies, to the extent possible, based on the available data, NF services, including any mental health or specialized psychiatric rehabilitative services, that may be needed; and

        (4) Includes the bases for the report's conclusions.

        (k)  For both categorical and individualized determinations, findings of the evaluation must be interpreted and explained to the individual and, where applicable, to a legal representative designated under State law.

        (l)  The evaluator must send a copy of the evaluation report to the—

        (1) Individual or resident and his or her legal representative;

        (2) Appropriate State authority in sufficient time for the State authorities to meet the times identified in § 483.112(c) for PASs and § 483.114(c) for ARRs;

        (3) Admitting or retaining NF;

        (4) Individual's attending physician; and

        (5) The discharging hospital if the individual is seeking NF admission from a hospital.

        (m) The evaluation may be terminated if the evaluator finds at any time during the evaluation that the individual being evaluated—

        (1) Does not have MI or IID; or

        (2) Has—

        (i) A primary diagnosis of dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder); or

        (ii) A non-primary diagnosis of dementia without a primary diagnosis that is a serious mental illness, and does not have a diagnosis of IID or a related condition.

        § 483.130   PASARR determination criteria.

#### § § 483.130

        (a)  Determinations made by the State mental health or intellectual disability authority as to whether NF level of services and specialized services are needed must be based on an evaluation of data concerning the individual, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  Determinations may be—

        (1) Advance group determinations, in accordance with this section, by category that take into account that certain diagnoses, levels of severity of illness, or need for a particular service clearly indicate that admission to or residence in a NF is normally needed, or that the provision of specialized services is not normally needed; or

        (2) Individualized determinations based on more extensive individualized evaluations as required in § 483.132, § 483.134, or § 483.136 (or, in the case of an individual having both IID and MI, §§ 483.134 and 483.136).

        (c)  Advance group determinations by category developed by the State mental health or intellectual disability authorities may be made applicable to individuals by the NF or other evaluator following Level I review only if existing data on the individual appear to be current and accurate and are sufficient to allow the evaluator readily to determine that the individual fits into the category established by the State authorities (see § 483.132(c)). Sources of existing data on the individual that could form the basis for applying a categorical determination by the State authorities would be hospital records, physician's evaluations, election of hospice status, records of community mental health centers or community intellectual disability or developmental disability providers.

        (d)  Examples of categories for which the State mental health or intellectual disability authority may make an advance group determination that NF services are needed are—

        (1) Convalescent care from an acute physical illness which—

        (i) Required hospitalization; and

        (ii) Does not meet all the criteria for an exempt hospital discharge, which is not subject to preadmission screening, as specified in § 483.106(b)(2).

        (2) Terminal illness, as defined for hospice purposes in § 418.3 of this chapter;

        (3) Severe physical illnesses such as coma, ventilator dependence, functioning at a brain stem level, or diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and congestive heart failure which result in a level of impairment so severe that the individual could not be expected to benefit from specialized services;

        (4) Provisional admissions pending further assessment in cases of delirium where an accurate diagnosis cannot be made until the delirium clears;

        (5) Provisional admissions pending further assessment in emergency situations requiring protective services, with placement in a nursing facility not to exceed 7 days; and

        (6) Very brief and finite stays of up to a fixed number of days to provide respite to in-home caregivers to whom the individual with MI or IID is expected to return following the brief NF stay.

        (e)  The State may specify time limits for categorical determinations that NF services are needed and in the case of paragraphs (d)(4), (5) and (6) of this section, must specify a time limit which is appropriate for provisional admissions pending further assessment and for emergency situations and respite care. If an individual is later determined to need a longer stay than the State's limit allows, the individual must be subjected to an annual resident review before continuation of the stay may be permitted and payment made for days of NF care beyond the State's time limit.

        (f) The State mental health and intellectual disability authorities may make categorical determinations that specialized services are not needed in the provisional, emergency and respite admission situations identified in § 483.130(d)(4)-(6). In all other cases, except for § 483.130(h), a determination that specialized services are not needed must be based on a more extensive individualized evaluation under § 483.134 or § 483.136.

        (g)  The State mental health and intellectual disability authorities must not make categorical determinations that specialized services are needed. Such a determination must be based on a more extensive individualized evaluation under § 483.134 or § 483.136 to determine the exact nature of the specialized services that are needed.

        (h)  The State intellectual disability authority may make categorical determinations that individuals with dementia, which exists in combination with intellectual disability or a related condition, do not need specialized services.

        (i) If a State mental health or intellectual disability authority determines NF needs by category, it may not waive the specialized services determination. The appropriate State authority must also determine whether specialized services are needed either by category (if permitted) or by individualized evaluations, as specified in § 483.134 or § 483.136.

        (j)  All determinations made by the State mental health and intellectual disability authority, regardless of how they are arrived at, must be recorded in the individual's record.

        (k)  The State mental health or intellectual disability authority must notify in writing the following entities of a determination made under this subpart:

        (1) The evaluated individual and his or her legal representative;

        (2) The admitting or retaining NF;

        (3) The individual or resident's attending physician; and

        (4) The discharging hospital, unless the individual is exempt from preadmission screening as provided for at § 483.106(b)(2).

        (l)  Each notice of the determination made by the State mental health or intellectual disability authority must include—

        (1) Whether a NF level of services is needed;

        (2) Whether specialized services are needed;

        (3) The placement options that are available to the individual consistent with these determinations; and

        (4) The rights of the individual to appeal the determination under subpart E of this part.

        (m)  Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, the placement options and the required State actions are as follows:

        (1)  Any applicant for admission to a NF who has MI or IID and who requires the level of services provided by a NF, regardless of whether specialized services are also needed, may be admitted to a NF, if the placement is appropriate, as determined in § 483.126. If specialized services are also needed, the State is responsible for providing or arranging for the provision of the specialized services.

        (2)  Any applicant for admission to a NF who has MI or IID and who does not require the level of services provided by a NF, regardless of whether specialized services are also needed, is inappropriate for NF placement and must not be admitted.

        (3)  Any NF resident with MI or IID who requires the level of services provided by a NF, regardless of the length of his or her stay or the need for specialized services, can continue to reside in the NF, if the placement is appropriate, as determined in § 483.126.

        (4)  Any NF resident with MI or IID who does not require the level of services provided by a NF but does require specialized services and who has continuously resided in a NF for at least 30 consecutive months before the date of determination may choose to continue to reside in the facility or to receive covered services in an alternative appropriate institutional or noninstitutional setting. Wherever the resident chooses to reside, the State must meet his or her specialized services needs. The determination notice must provide information concerning how, when, and by whom the various placement options available to the resident will be fully explained to the resident.

        (5)  Any NF resident with MI or IID who does not require the level of services provided by a NF but does require specialized services and who has resided in a NF for less than 30 consecutive months must be discharged in accordance with § 483.15(b) to an appropriate setting where the State must provide specialized services. The determination notice must provide information on how, when, and by whom the resident will be advised of discharge arrangements and of his/her appeal rights under both PASARR and discharge provisions.

        (6)  Any NF resident with MI or IID who does not require the level of services provided by a NF and does not require specialized services regardless of his or her length of stay, must be discharged in accordance with § 483.15(b). The determination notice must provide information on how, when, and by whom the resident will be advised of discharge arrangements and of his or her appeal rights under both PASARR and discharge provisions.

        § 483.132   Evaluating the need for NF services and NF level of care (PASARR/NF).

#### § § 483.132

        (a)  For each applicant for admission to a NF and each NF resident who has MI or IID, the evaluator must assess whether—

        (1) The individual's total needs are such that his or her needs can be met in an appropriate community setting;

        (2) The individual's total needs are such that they can be met only on an inpatient basis, which may include the option of placement in a home and community-based services waiver program, but for which the inpatient care would be required;

        (3) If inpatient care is appropriate and desired, the NF is an appropriate institutional setting for meeting those needs in accordance with § 483.126; or

        (4) If the inpatient care is appropriate and desired but the NF is not the appropriate setting for meeting the individual's needs in accordance with § 483.126, another setting such as an ICF/IID (including small, community-based facilities), an IMD providing services to individuals aged 65 or older, or a psychiatric hospital is an appropriate institutional setting for meeting those needs.

        (b)  In determining appropriate placement, the evaluator must prioritize the physical and mental needs of the individual being evaluated, taking into account the severity of each condition.

        (c)  At a minimum, the data relied on to make a determination must include:

        (1) Evaluation of physical status (for example, diagnoses, date of onset, medical history, and prognosis);

        (2) Evaluation of mental status (for example, diagnoses, date of onset, medical history, likelihood that the individual may be a danger to himself/herself or others); and

        (3) Functional assessment (activities of daily living).

        (d) Based on the data compiled in § 483.132 and, as appropriate, in §§ 483.134 and 483.136, the State mental health or intellectual disability authority must determine whether an NF level of services is needed.

        (2) A comprehensive drug history including current or immediate past use of medications that could mask symptoms or mimic mental illness.

        (3) A psychosocial evaluation of the person, including current living arrangements and medical and support systems.

        (4) A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation including a complete psychiatric history, evaluation of intellectual functioning, memory functioning, and orientation, description of current attitudes and overt behaviors, affect, suicidal or homicidal ideation, paranoia, and degree of reality testing (presence and content of delusions) and hallucinations.

        (5) A functional assessment of the individual's ability to engage in activities of daily living and the level of support that would be needed to assist the individual to perform these activities while living in the community. The assessment must determine whether this level of support can be provided to the individual in an alternative community setting or whether the level of support needed is such that NF placement is required.

        (6) The functional assessment must address the following areas: Self-monitoring of health status, self-administering and scheduling of medical treatment, including medication compliance, or both, self-monitoring of nutritional status, handling money, dressing appropriately, and grooming.

        (c)  (1) If the history and physical examination are not performed by a physician, then a physician must review and concur with the conclusions.

        (2) The State may designate the mental health professionals who are qualified—

        (i) To perform the evaluations required under paragraph (b) (2)-(6) of this section including the—

        § 484.205   Basis of payment.

#### § § 484.205

        (a)  An HHA receives a national, standardized prospective payment amount for home health services previously paid on a reasonable cost basis (except the osteoporosis drug defined in section 1861(kk) of the Act) as of August 5, 1997. The national, standardized prospective payment is determined in accordance with § 484.215.

        (b) —(1)  For episodes beginning on or before December 31, 2019, an HHA receives a unit of payment equal to a national, standardized prospective 60-day episode payment amount.

        (d)  The national, standardized prospective payment amount represents payment in full for all costs associated with furnishing home health services and is subject to the following adjustments and additional payments:

        (1) A low-utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) of a predetermined per-visit rate as specified in § 484.230.

        (g)  Normally, there are two payments (initial and final) paid for an HH PPS unit of payment. The initial payment is made in response to a request for anticipated payment (RAP) as described in paragraph (h) of this section, and the residual final payment is made in response to the submission of a final claim. Split percentage payments are made in accordance with requirements at § 409.43(c) of this chapter.

        (ii)  Split percentage payments are not made to HHAs that are certified for participation in Medicare effective on or after January 1, 2019. Newly enrolled HHAs must submit a request for anticipated payment, which is set at 0 percent, at the beginning of every 30-day period. An HHA that is certified for participation in Medicare effective on or after January 1, 2019 receives a single payment for a 30-day period of care after the final claim is submitted.

        (3)  All HHAs must submit a request for anticipated payment within 5 calendar days after the start of care date for initial 30-day periods and within 5 calendar days after the “from date” for each subsequent 30-day period of care, which is set at 0 percent at the beginning of every 30-day period. HHAs receive a single payment for a 30-day period of care after the final claim is submitted.

        (4)  All HHAs must submit a Notice of Admission (NOA) at the beginning of the initial 30-day period of care as described in paragraph (j) of this section. HHAs receive a single payment for a 30-day period of care after the final claim is submitted.

        (h)  (1) HHAs that are certified for participation in Medicare effective by December 31, 2018 submit requests for anticipated payment (RAPs) to request the initial split percentage payment as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. HHAs that are certified for participation in Medicare effective on or after January 1, 2019 are still required to submit RAPs although no split percentage payments are made in response to these RAP submissions. The HHA can submit a RAP when all of the following conditions are met:

        (i) After the OASIS assessment required at § 484.55(b)(1) and (d) is complete, locked or export ready, or there is an agency-wide internal policy establishing the OASIS data is finalized for transmission to the national assessment system.

        (ii) Once a physician or allowed practitioner's verbal orders for home care have been received and documented as required at §§ 484.60(b) and 409.43(d) of this chapter.

        (iii) A plan of care has been established and sent to the physician or allowed practitioner as required at § 409.43(c) of this chapter.

        (iv) The first service visit under that plan has been delivered.

        (2) A RAP is based on the physician or allowed practitioner signature requirements in § 409.43(c) of this chapter and is not a Medicare claim for purposes of the Act (although it is a “claim” for purposes of Federal, civil, criminal, and administrative law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the following:

        (i) Civil Monetary Penalties Law (as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(i)(2)).

        (ii) The Civil False Claims Act (as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3729(c)).

        (iii) The Criminal False Claims Act (18 U.S.C. 287)).

        (iv) The RAP is canceled and recovered unless the claim is submitted within the greater of 60 days from the end date of the appropriate unit of payment, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or 60 days from the issuance of the RAP.

        (3) CMS has the authority to reduce, disprove, or cancel a RAP in situations when protecting Medicare program integrity warrants this action.

        (i) —(1)  All HHAs must submit a RAP, which is to be paid at 0 percent, within 5 calendar days after the start of care and within 5 calendar days after the “from date” for each subsequent 30-day period of care.

        (2)  The HHA shall submit RAPs only when all of the following conditions are met:

        (i) Once physician or allowed practitioner's written or verbal orders that contain the services required for the initial visit have been received and documented as required at §§ 484.60(b) and 409.43(d) of this chapter.

        (ii) The initial visit within the 60-day certification period must have been made and the individual admitted to home health care.

        (3)  When a home health agency does not file the required RAP for its Medicare patients within 5 calendar days after the start of each 30-day period of care—

        (i) Medicare does not pay for those days of home health services based on the “from date” on the claim to the date of filing of the RAP;

        (ii) The wage and case-mix adjusted 30-day period payment amount is reduced by 1/30th for each day from the home health based on the “from date” on the claim until the date of filing of the RAP;

        (iii) No LUPA payments are made that fall within the late period;

        (iv) The payment reduction cannot exceed the total payment of the claim; and

        (v)(A) The non-covered days are a provider liability; and

        (B) The provider must not bill the beneficiary for the non-covered days.

        (4)  (i) CMS may waive the consequences of failure to submit a timely-filed RAP specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (ii) CMS determines if a circumstance encountered by a home health agency is exceptional and qualifies for waiver of the consequence specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (iii) A home health agency must fully document and furnish any requested documentation to CMS for a determination of exception. An exceptional circumstance may be due to, but is not limited to the following:

        (A) Fires, floods, earthquakes, or similar unusual events that inflict extensive damage to the home health agency's ability to operate.

        (B) A CMS or Medicare contractor systems issue that is beyond the control of the home health agency.

        (C) A newly Medicare-certified home health agency that is notified of that certification after the Medicare certification date, or which is awaiting its user ID from its Medicare contractor.

        (D) Other situations determined by CMS to be beyond the control of the home health agency.

        (j) —(1)  For all 30-day periods of care after January 1, 2022, all HHAs must submit a Notice of Admission (NOA) to their Medicare contractor within 5 calendar days after the start of care date. The NOA is a one-time submission to establish the home health period of care and covers contiguous 30-day periods of care until the individual is discharged from Medicare home health services.

        (2)  In order to submit the NOA, the following criteria must be met:

        (i) Once a physician or allowed practitioner's written or verbal orders that contains the services required for the initial visit have been received and documented as required at §§ 484.60(b) and 409.43(d) of this chapter.

        (ii) The initial visit must have been made and the individual admitted to home health care.

        (3)  When a home health agency does not file the required NOA for its Medicare patients within 5 calendar days after the start of care—

        (i) Medicare does not pay for those days of home health services from the start date to the date of filing of the notice of admission;

        (ii) The wage and case-mix adjusted 30-day period payment amount is reduced by 1/30th for each day from the home health start of care date until the date of filing of the NOA;

        (iii) No LUPA payments are made that fall within the late NOA period;

        (iv) The payment reduction cannot exceed the total payment of the claim; and

        (v)(A) The non-covered days are a provider liability; and

        (B) The provider must not bill the beneficiary for the non-covered days.

        (4)  (i) CMS may waive the consequences of failure to submit a timely-filed NOA specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section.

        (ii) CMS determines if a circumstance encountered by a home health agency is exceptional and qualifies for waiver of the consequence specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section.

        (iii) A home health agency must fully document and furnish any requested documentation to CMS for a determination of exception. An exceptional circumstance may be due to, but is not limited to the following:

        (A) Fires, floods, earthquakes, or similar unusual events that inflict extensive damage to the home health agency's ability to operate.

        (B) A CMS or Medicare contractor systems issue that is beyond the control of the home health agency.

        § 484.215   Initial establishment of the calculation of the national, standardized prospective payment rates.

#### § § 484.215

        (a)  In calculating the initial unadjusted national 60-day episode payment applicable for a service furnished by an HHA using data on the most recent available audited cost reports, CMS determines each HHA's costs by summing its allowable costs for the period. CMS determines the national mean cost per visit.

        (b)  In calculating the initial unadjusted national 60-day episode payment, CMS determines the national mean utilization for each of the six disciplines using home health claims data.

        (c)  CMS uses the HHA market basket index to adjust the HHA cost data to reflect cost increases occurring between October 1, 1996 through September 30, 2001.

        (d)  For episodes beginning on or before December 31, 2019, CMS calculates the unadjusted national 60-day episode payment in the following manner:

        (1) By computing the mean national cost per visit.

        (2) By computing the national mean utilization for each discipline.

        (3) By multiplying the mean national cost per visit by the national mean utilization summed in the aggregate for the six disciplines.

        (4) By adding to the amount derived in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, amounts for nonroutine medical supplies, an OASIS adjustment for estimated ongoing reporting costs, an OASIS adjustment for the one time implementation costs associated with assessment scheduling form changes and amounts for Part B therapies that could have been unbundled to Part B prior to October 1, 2000. The resulting amount is the unadjusted national 60-day episode rate.

        (e)  CMS standardizes—

        (1) The cost data described in paragraph (a) of this section to remove the effects of geographic variation in wage levels and variation in case-mix;

        (2) The cost data for geographic variation in wage levels using the hospital wage index; and

        (3) The cost data for HHA variation in case-mix using the case-mix indices and other data that indicate HHA case-mix.

        (f) For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, a national, standardized prospective 30-day payment rate applies. The national, standardized prospective 30-day payment rate is an amount determined by the Secretary, as subsequently adjusted in accordance with § 484.225.

        § 484.220   Calculation of the case-mix and wage area adjusted prospective payment rates.

#### § § 484.220

        CMS adjusts the national, standardized prospective payment rates as referenced in § 484.215 to account for the following:

        (a) HHA case-mix using a case-mix index to explain the relative resource utilization of different patients. To address changes to the case-mix that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of different units of service that do not reflect real changes in case-mix, the national, standardized prospective payment rate will be adjusted downward as follows:

        (1) For CY 2008, the adjustment is 2.75 percent.

        (2) For CY 2009 and CY 2010, the adjustment is 2.75 percent in each year.

        (3) For CY 2011, the adjustment is 3.79 percent.

        (4) For CY 2012, the adjustment is 3.79 percent.

        (5) For CY 2013, the adjustment is 1.32 percent.

        (6) For CY 2016, CY 2017, and CY 2018, the adjustment is 0.97 percent in each year.

        (b) Geographic differences in wage levels using an appropriate wage index based on the site of service of the beneficiary.

        (c) Beginning on January 1, 2023, CMS applies a cap on decreases to the home health wage index such that the wage index applied to a geographic area is not less than 95 percent of the wage index applied to that geographic area in the prior calendar year. The 5-percent cap on negative wage index changes is implemented in a budget neutral manner through the use of wage index budget neutrality factors.

        § 484.225   Annual update of the unadjusted national, standardized prospective payment rates.

#### § § 484.225

        (a) CMS annually updates the unadjusted national, standardized prospective payment rate on a calendar year basis (in accordance with section 1895(b)(1)(B) of the Act).

        (b) For 2007 and subsequent calendar years, in accordance with section 1895(b)(3)(B)(v) of the Act, in the case of a home health agency that does not submit home health quality data, as specified by the Secretary, the unadjusted national, standardized prospective rate is equal to the rate for the previous calendar year increased by the applicable home health market basket index amount minus 2 percentage points. Any reduction of the percentage change will apply only to the calendar year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the prospective payment amount for a subsequent calendar year.

        (c) For CY 2020, the national, standardized prospective 30-day payment amount is an amount determined by the Secretary. CMS annually updates this amount on a calendar year basis in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

> [80 FR 68717, Nov. 5, 2015, as amended at 83 FR 56629, Nov. 13, 2018; 84 FR 60645, Nov. 8, 2019]

        § 484.230   Low-utilization payment adjustments.

#### § § 484.230

        (a) For episodes beginning on or before December 31, 2019, an episode with four or fewer visits is paid the national per-visit amount by discipline determined in accordance with § 484.215(a) and updated annually by the applicable market basket for each visit type, in accordance with § 484.225.

        (1) The national per-visit amount is adjusted by the appropriate wage index based on the site of service of the beneficiary.

        (2) An amount is added to the low-utilization payment adjustments for low-utilization episodes that occur as the beneficiary's only episode or initial episode in a sequence of adjacent episodes.

        (3) For purposes of the home health PPS, a sequence of adjacent episodes for a beneficiary is a series of claims with no more than 60 days without home care between the end of one episode, which is the 60th day (except for episodes that have been PEP-adjusted), and the beginning of the next episode.

        (b) For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, an HHA receives a national 30-day payment of a predetermined rate for home health services, unless CMS determines at the end of the 30-day period that the HHA furnished minimal services to a patient during the 30-day period.

        (1) For each payment group used to case-mix adjust the 30-day payment rate, the 10th percentile value of total visits during a 30-day period of care is used to create payment group specific thresholds with a minimum threshold of at least 2 visits for each case-mix group.

        (2) A 30-day period with a total number of visits less than the threshold is paid the national per-visit amount by discipline determined in accordance with § 484.215(a) and updated annually by the applicable market basket for each visit type, in accordance with § 484.225.

        (3) The national per-visit amount is adjusted by the appropriate wage index based on the site of service for the beneficiary.

        (c) An amount is added to low-utilization payment adjustments for low-utilization periods that occur as the beneficiary's only 30-day period or initial 30-day period in a sequence of adjacent periods of care. For purposes of the home health PPS, a sequence of adjacent periods of care for a beneficiary is a series of claims with no more than 60 days without home care between the end of one period, which is the 30th day (except for episodes that have been partial payment adjusted), and the beginning of the next episode.

> [83 FR 56629, Nov. 13, 2018]

        § 484.235   Partial payment adjustments.

#### § § 484.235

        (a)  (1) An HHA receives a national, standardized 60-day payment of a predetermined rate for home health services unless CMS determines an intervening event, defined as a beneficiary elected transfer or discharge with goals met or no expectation of return to home health and the beneficiary returned to home health during the 60-day episode, warrants a new 60-day episode for purposes of payment. A start of care OASIS assessment and physician or allowed practitioner certification of the new plan of care are required.

        (2) The PEP adjustment does not apply in situations of transfers among HHAs of common ownership.

        (i) Those situations are considered services provided under arrangement on behalf of the originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the common ownership interest for the balance of the 60-day episode.

        (ii) The common ownership exception to the transfer PEP adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary moves to a different MSA or Non-MSA during the 60-day episode before the transfer to the receiving HHA.

        (iii) The transferring HHA in situations of common ownership not only serves as a billing agent, but must also exercise professional responsibility over the arranged-for services in order for services provided under arrangements to be paid.

        (3) If the intervening event warrants a new 60-day payment and a new physician or allowed practitioner certification and a new plan of care, the initial HHA receives a partial episode payment adjustment reflecting the length of time the patient remained under its care based on the first billable visit date through and including the last billable visit date. The PEP is calculated by determining the actual days served as a proportion of 60 multiplied by the initial 60-day payment amount.

        (b)  (1) An HHA receives a national, standardized 30-day payment of a predetermined rate for home health services unless CMS determines an intervening event, defined as a beneficiary elected transfer or discharge with goals met or no expectation of return to home health and the beneficiary returned to home health during the 30-day period, warrants a new 30-day period for purposes of payment. A start of care OASIS assessment and certification of the new plan of care are required.

        (2) The partial payment adjustment does not apply in situations of transfers among HHAs of common ownership.

        (i) Those situations are considered services provided under arrangement on behalf of the originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the common ownership interest for the balance of the 30-day period.

        (ii) The common ownership exception to the transfer partial payment adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary moves to a different MSA or Non-MSA during the 30-day period before the transfer to the receiving HHA.

        (iii) The transferring HHA in situations of common ownership not only serves as a billing agent, but must also exercise professional responsibility over the arranged-for services in order for services provided under arrangements to be paid.

        (3) If the intervening event warrants a new 30-day payment and a new physician or allowed practitioner certification and a new plan of care, the initial HHA receives a partial payment adjustment reflecting the length of time the patient remained under its care based on the first billable visit date through and including the last billable visit date. The partial payment is calculated by determining the actual days served as a proportion of 30 multiplied by the initial 30-day payment amount.

        § 484.240   Outlier payments.

#### § § 484.240

        (a) For episodes beginning on or before December 31, 2019, an HHA receives an outlier payment for an episode whose estimated costs exceeds a threshold amount for each case-mix group. The outlier threshold for each case-mix group is the episode payment amount for that group, or the PEP adjustment amount for the episode, plus a fixed dollar loss amount that is the same for all case-mix groups.

        (b) For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, an HHA receives an outlier payment for a 30-day period whose estimated cost exceeds a threshold amount for each case-mix group. The outlier threshold for each case-mix group is the 30-day payment amount for that group, or the partial payment adjustment amount for the 30-day period, plus a fixed dollar loss amount that is the same for all case-mix groups.

        (c) The outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of imputed cost beyond the threshold.

        (d) CMS imputes the cost for each claim by multiplying the national per-15 minute unit amount of each discipline by the number of 15 minute units in the discipline and computing the total imputed cost for all disciplines.

        (B) On measures specified under sections 1899B(c)(1) and 1899B(d)(1) of the Act.

        (ii) Standardized patient assessment data required under section 1899B(b)(1) of the Act.

        (iii) For purposes of HHCAHPS survey data submission, the following additional requirements apply:

        (A)  An HHA that has less than 60 eligible unique HHCAHPS patients must annually submit to CMS their total HHCAHPS patient count to CMS to be exempt from the HHCAHPS reporting requirements for a calendar year.

        (B)  An HHA must contract with an approved, independent HHCAHPS survey vendor to administer the HHCAHPS on its behalf.

        (C)  CMS approves an HHCAHPS survey vendor if the applicant has been in business for a minimum of 3 years and has conducted surveys of individuals and samples for at least 2 years.

        () For HHCAHPS, a “survey of individuals” is defined as the collection of data from at least 600 individuals selected by statistical sampling methods and the data collected are used for statistical purposes.

        () All applicants that meet the requirements in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(C) are approved by CMS.

        (D)  No organization, firm, or business that owns, operates, or provides staffing for an HHA is permitted to administer its own HHCAHPS Survey or administer the survey on behalf of any other HHA in the capacity as an HHCAHPS survey vendor. Such organizations are not be approved by CMS as HHCAHPS survey vendors.

        (E)  Approved HHCAHPS survey vendors must fully comply with all HHCAHPS oversight activities, including allowing CMS and its HHCAHPS program team to perform site visits at the vendors' company locations.

        (ii)  (A) A home health agency must meet or exceed the data submission threshold for each submission year (July 1 through June 30) set at 90 percent of all required OASIS or successor instrument records submitted through the CMS designated data submission systems.

        (B) A home health agency must meet or exceed the data submission compliance threshold described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to avoid receiving a 2-percentage point reduction to its annual payment update for a given fiscal year described under § 484.225(b).

        (3)  CMS may remove a quality measure from the HH QRP based on one or more of the following factors:

        (i) Measure performance among HHAs is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions in improvements in performance can no longer be made.

        (ii) Performance or improvement on a measure does not result in better patient outcomes.

        (iii) A measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice.

        (iv) The availability of a more broadly applicable (across settings, populations, or conditions) measure for the particular topic.

        (v) The availability of a measure that is more proximal in time to desired patient outcomes for the particular topic.

        (vi) The availability of a measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic.

        (vii) Collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm.

        (viii) The costs associated with a measure outweigh the benefit of its continued use in the program.

        (c)  (1) An HHA may request and CMS may grant exceptions or extensions to the reporting requirements under paragraph (b) of this section for one or more quarters, when there are certain extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the HHA.

          (1) A competing HHA that wishes to request an exception with respect to quality data reporting requirements must submit its request to CMS within 90 days of the date that the extraordinary circumstances occurred. Specific requirements for submission of a request for an exception are available on the CMS website.

          (2) CMS may grant an exception to one or more HHAs that have not requested an exception if CMS determines either of the following:

          (i) That a systemic problem with CMS data collection systems directly affected the ability of the HHA to submit data.

          (ii) That an extraordinary circumstance has affected an entire region or locale.

          § 484.358   HHVBP Measure removal factors.

#### § § 484.358

          CMS may remove a quality measure from the expanded HHVBP Model based on one or more of the following factors:

          (a) Measure performance among HHAs is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions in improvements in performance can no longer be made (that is, topped out).

          (b) Performance or improvement on a measure does not result in better patient outcomes.

          (c) A measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice.

          (d) A more broadly applicable measure (across settings, populations, or conditions) for the particular topic is available.

          (e) A measure that is more proximal in time to desired patient outcomes for the particular topic is available.

          (f) A measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic is available.

          (g) Collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm.

          (h) The costs associated with a measure outweigh the benefit of its continued use in the program.

          § 484.360   Calculation of the Total Performance Score.

#### § § 484.360

          A competing HHA's Total Performance Score for a performance year is calculated as follows:

          (a) CMS awards points to the competing home health agency for performance on each of the applicable measures.

          (1) CMS awards greater than or equal to 0 points and less than 10 points for achievement to each competing home health agency whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance year meets or exceeds the applicable cohort's achievement threshold but is less than the applicable cohort's benchmark for that measure.

          (2) CMS awards greater than 0 but less than 9 points for improvement to each competing home health agency whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance year exceeds the improvement threshold but is less than the applicable cohort's benchmark for that measure.

          (3) CMS awards 10 points to a competing home health agency whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance year meets or exceeds the applicable cohort's benchmark for that measure.

          (b) For all performance years, CMS calculates the weighted sum of points awarded for each applicable measure within each category of measures (OASIS-based, claims-based, and HHCAHPS Survey-based) weighted at 35 percent for the OASIS-based measure category, 35 percent for the claims-based measure category, and 30 percent for the HHCAHPS survey measure category when all three measure categories are reported, to calculate a value worth 100 percent of the Total Performance Score.

          (1) Where a single measure category is not included in the calculation of the Total Performance Score for an individual HHA, due to insufficient volume for all of the measures in the category, the remaining measure categories are reweighted such that the proportional contribution of each remaining measure category is consistent with the weights assigned when all three measure categories are available. Where two measure categories are not included in the calculation of the Total Performance Score for an individual HHA, due to insufficient volume for all measures in those measure categories, the remaining measure category is weighted at 100 percent of the Total Performance Score.

          (2) When one or more, but not all, of the measures in a measure category are not included in the calculation of the Total Performance Score for an individual HHA, due to insufficient volume for at least one measure in the category, the remaining measures in the category are reweighted such that the proportional contribution of each remaining measure is consistent with the weights assigned when all measures within the category are available.

          (c) The sum of the weight-adjusted points awarded to a competing HHA for each applicable measure is the competing HHA's Total Performance Score for the calendar year. A competing HHA must have a minimum of five applicable measures to receive a Total Performance Score.

          § 484.365   Payments for home health services under the Expanded Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model.

#### § § 484.365

          CMS determines a payment adjustment up to the applicable percent, upward or downward, under the expanded HHVBP Model for each competing HHA based on the agency's Total Performance Score using a linear exchange function that includes all other HHAs in its cohort that received a Total Performance Score for the applicable performance year. Payment adjustments made under the expanded HHVBP Model are calculated as a percentage of otherwise-applicable payments for home health services provided under section 1895 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff).

          § 484.370   Process for determining and applying the value-based payment adjustment under the Expanded Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model.

#### § § 484.370

          (a)  Competing home health agencies are ranked within the larger-volume and smaller-volume cohorts nationwide based on the performance standards in this part that apply to the expanded HHVBP Model, and CMS makes value-based payment adjustments to the competing HHAs as specified in this section.

          (b)  The value-based payment adjustment amount is calculated by multiplying the home health prospective payment final claim payment amount as calculated in accordance with § 484.205 by the payment adjustment percentage.

          (c)  The payment adjustment percentage is calculated as the product of all of the following:

          (1) The applicable percent as defined in § 484.345.

          (2) The competing HHA's Total Performance Score divided by 100.

          (3) The linear exchange function slope.

        (1) Chapters 7, 8, 12, and 13 of the adopted Health Care Facilities Code do not apply to an REH.

        (2) If application of the Health Care Facilities Code required under paragraph (d) of this section would result in unreasonable hardship for the REH, CMS may waive specific provisions of the Health Care Facilities Code, but only if the waiver does not adversely affect the health and safety of patients.

        (a)  (1) A hospital must inform each patient, or when appropriate, the patient's representative (as allowed under state law), of the patient's rights, in advance of furnishing or discontinuing patient care whenever possible.

        (2) The hospital must establish a process for prompt resolution of patient grievances and must inform each patient whom to contact to file a grievance. The hospital's governing body must approve and be responsible for the effective operation of the grievance process and must review and resolve grievances, unless it delegates the responsibility in writing to a grievance committee. The grievance process must include a mechanism for timely referral of patient concerns regarding quality of care or premature discharge to the appropriate Utilization and Quality Control Quality Improvement Organization. At a minimum:

        (i) The hospital must establish a clearly explained procedure for the submission of a patient's written or verbal grievance to the hospital.

        (2) The patient or their representative (as allowed under state law) has the right to make informed decisions regarding their care. The patient's rights include being informed of their health status, being involved in care planning and treatment, and being able to request or refuse treatment. This right must not be construed as a mechanism to demand the provision of treatment or services deemed medically unnecessary or inappropriate.

        (3) The patient has the right to formulate advance directives and to have hospital staff and practitioners who provide care in the hospital comply with these directives, in accordance with §§ 489.100, 489.102, and 489.104 of this chapter.

The hospital must not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their own medical records and must actively seek to meet these requests as quickly as its record keeping system permits.

        (e)  All patients have the right to be free from physical or mental abuse, and corporal punishment. All patients have the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff. Restraint or seclusion may only be imposed to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others and must be discontinued at the earliest possible time.

        (1)(i) A restraint is—

        (A) Any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient to move their arms, legs, body, or head freely; or

        (B) A drug or medication when it is used as a restriction to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement and is not a standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition.

        (C) A restraint does not include devices, such as orthopedically prescribed devices, surgical dressings or bandages, protective helmets, or other methods that involve the physical holding of a patient for the purpose of conducting routine physical examinations or tests, or to protect the patient from falling out of bed, or to permit the patient to participate in activities without the risk of physical harm (this does not include a physical escort).

        (3) The type or technique of restraint or seclusion used must be the least restrictive intervention that will be effective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm.

        (4) The CAH must have written policies and procedures regarding the use of restraint and seclusion that are consistent with current standards of practice.

        (f)  The patient has the right to safe implementation of restraint or seclusion by trained staff.

        (1) The CAH must provide patient-centered, trauma informed competency-based training and education of CAH personnel and staff, including medical staff, and, as applicable, personnel providing contracted services in the CAH, on the use of restraint and seclusion.

        (2) The training must include alternatives to the use of restraint/seclusion.

        (g)  Hospitals must report deaths associated with the use of seclusion or restraint.

        (a)  Emergency services are available on a 24-hours a day basis.

        (b)  Equipment, supplies, and medication used in treating emergency cases are kept at the CAH and are readily available for treating emergency cases. The items available must include the following:

        (1)  commonly used in life-saving procedures, including analgesics, local anesthetics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidotes and emetics, serums and toxoids, antiarrythmics, cardiac glycosides, antihypertensives, diuretics, and electrolytes and replacement solutions.

        (2)  commonly used in life-saving procedures, including airways, endotracheal tubes, ambu bag/valve/mask, oxygen, tourniquets, immobilization devices, nasogastric tubes, splints, IV therapy supplies, suction machine, defibrillator, cardiac monitor, chest tubes, and indwelling urinary catheters.

        (c)  The facility provides, either directly or under arrangements, the following:

        (1) Services for the procurement, safekeeping, and transfusion of blood, including the availability of blood products needed for emergencies on a 24-hours a day basis.

        (2) Blood storage facilities that meet the requirements of 42 CFR part 493, subpart K, and are under the control and supervision of a pathologist or other qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy. If blood banking services are provided under an arrangement, the arrangement is approved by the facility's medical staff and by the persons directly responsible for the operation of the facility.

        (d)  (1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, there must be a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a physician assistant, a nurse practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist, with training or experience in emergency care, on call and immediately available by telephone or radio contact, and available on site within the following timeframes:

        (i) Within 30 minutes, on a 24-hour a day basis, if the CAH is located in an area other than an area described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; or

        (ii) Within 60 minutes, on a 24-hour a day basis, if all of the following requirements are met:

        (A) The CAH is located in an area designated as a frontier area (that is, an area with fewer than six residents per square mile based on the latest population data published by the Bureau of the Census) or in an area that meets the criteria for a remote location adopted by the State in its rural health care plan, and approved by CMS, under section 1820(b) of the Act.

        (B) The State has determined, under criteria in its rural health care plan, that allowing an emergency response time longer than 30 minutes is the only feasible method of providing emergency care to residents of the area served by the CAH.

        (C) The State maintains documentation showing that the response time of up to 60 minutes at a particular CAH it designates is justified because other available alternatives would increase the time needed to stabilize a patient in an emergency.

        (i) The CAH has no greater than 10 beds;

        (ii) The CAH is located in an area designated as a frontier area or remote location as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section;

        (iii) The State in which the CAH is located submits a letter to CMS signed by the Governor, following consultation on the issue of using RNs on a temporary basis as part of their State rural healthcare plan with the State Boards of Medicine and Nursing, and in accordance with State law, requesting that a registered nurse with training and experience in emergency care be included in the list of personnel specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The letter from the Governor must attest that he or she has consulted with State Boards of Medicine and Nursing about issues related to access to and the quality of emergency services in the States. The letter from the Governor must also describe the circumstances and duration of the temporary request to include the registered nurses on the list of personnel specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

        (iv) Once a Governor submits a letter, as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a CAH must submit documentation to the State survey agency demonstrating that it has been unable, due to the shortage of such personnel in the area, to provide adequate coverage as specified in this paragraph (d).

        (4) The request, as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, and the withdrawal of the request, may be submitted to us at any time, and are effective upon submission.

        (e)  Effective July 1, 2025, in accordance with the complexity and scope of services offered, there must be adequate provisions (as required under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) and protocols to meet the emergency needs of patients.

        (1)  Protocols must be consistent with nationally recognized and evidence-based guidelines for the care of patients with emergency conditions, including but not limited to patients with obstetrical emergencies, complications, and immediate post-delivery care.

        (2)  Applicable staff, as identified by the CAH, must be trained annually on the protocols and provisions implemented pursuant to this section.

        (i) The governing body must identify and document which staff must complete such training.

        (ii) The CAH must document in the staff personnel records that the training was successfully completed.

        (iii) The CAH must be able to demonstrate staff knowledge on such training.

        (iv) The CAH must use findings from its QAPI program, as required at § 485.641, to inform staff training needs and any additions, revisions, or updates to training topics on an ongoing basis.

        (f)  The CAH must, in coordination with emergency response systems in the area, establish procedures under which a doctor of medicine or osteopathy is immediately available by telephone or radio contact on a 24-hours a day basis to receive emergency calls, provide information on treatment of emergency patients, and refer patients to the CAH or other appropriate locations for treatment.

        § 485.642   Condition of participation: Discharge planning.

#### § § 485.642

        A Critical Access Hospital (CAH) must have an effective discharge planning process that focuses on the patient's goals and treatment preferences and includes the patient and his or her caregivers/support person(s) as active partners in the discharge planning for post-discharge care. The discharge planning process and the discharge plan must be consistent with the patient's goals for care and his or her treatment preferences, ensure an effective transition of the patient from the CAH to post-discharge care, and reduce the factors leading to preventable CAH and hospital readmissions.

        (a)  The CAH's discharge planning process must identify, at an early stage of hospitalization, those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge in the absence of adequate discharge planning and must provide a discharge planning evaluation for those patients so identified as well as for other patients upon the request of the patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.

        (1) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for post-CAH care will be made before discharge and to avoid unnecessary delays in discharge.

        (2) A discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate post-CAH services, including, but not limited to, hospice care services, post-CAH extended care services, home health services, and non-health care services and community based care providers, and must also include a determination of the availability of the appropriate services as well as of the patient's access to those services.

        (3) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in the patient's medical record for use in establishing an appropriate discharge plan and the results of the evaluation must be discussed with the patient (or the patient's representative).

        (4) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the CAH must arrange for the development and initial implementation of a discharge plan for the patient.

        (5) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan required under this paragraph must be developed by, or under the supervision of, a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified personnel.

        (6) The CAH's discharge planning process must require regular re-evaluation of the patient's condition to identify changes that require modification of the discharge plan. The discharge plan must be updated, as needed, to reflect these changes.

        (7) The CAH must assess its discharge planning process on a regular basis. The assessment must include ongoing, periodic review of a representative sample of discharge plans, including those patients who were readmitted within 30 days of a previous admission, to ensure that the plans are responsive to patient post-discharge needs.

        (8) The CAH must assist patients, their families, or the patient's representative in selecting a post-acute care provider by using and sharing data that includes, but is not limited to, HHA, SNF, IRF, or LTCH data on quality measures and data on resource use measures. The CAH must ensure that the post-acute care data on quality measures and data on resource use measures is relevant and applicable to the patient's goals of care and treatment preferences.

        (b)  The CAH must discharge the patient, and also transfer or refer the patient where applicable, along with all necessary medical information pertaining to the patient's current course of illness and treatment, post-discharge goals of care, and treatment preferences, at the time of discharge, to the appropriate post-acute care service providers and suppliers, facilities, agencies, and other outpatient service providers and practitioners responsible for the patient's follow-up or ancillary care.

#### § § 485.643

        The CAH must have and implement written protocols that:

        (a) Incorporate an agreement with an OPO designated under part 486 of this chapter, under which it must notify, in a timely manner, the OPO or a third party designated by the OPO of individuals whose death is imminent or who have died in the CAH. The OPO determines medical suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the CAH, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the CAH for this purpose;

        (b) Incorporate an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be appropriate to assure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with organ procurement;

        (c) Ensure, in collaboration with the designated OPO, that the family of each potential donor is informed of its option to either donate or not donate organs, tissues, or eyes. The individual designated by the CAH to initiate the request to the family must be a designated requestor. A designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community in the methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation;

        (d) Encourage discretion and sensitivity with respect to the circumstances, views, and beliefs of the families of potential donors;

        (e) Ensure that the CAH works cooperatively with the designated OPO, tissue bank and eye bank in educating staff on donation issues, reviewing death records to improve identification of potential donors, and maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes take place.

        (f) For purposes of these standards, the term “organ” means a human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestines (or multivisceral organs).

          (f) Have procedures to obtain payment for non-renal organs provided to transplant centers.

          (g) Agree to enter into an agreement with any hospital or critical access hospital in the OPO's service area, including a transplant hospital that requests an agreement.

          (h) Meet the conditions for coverage for organ procurement organizations, which include both outcome and process performance measures.

          (i) Meet the provisions of titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Act, section 371(b) of the Public Health Services Act, and any other applicable Federal regulations.

          § 486.304   Requirements for designation.

#### § § 486.304

          (a) Designation is a condition for payment. Payment may be made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for organ procurement costs attributable to payments made to an OPO by a hospital only if the OPO has been designated by CMS as an OPO.

          (b) An OPO must be certified as a qualified OPO by CMS under 42 U.S.C. 273(b) and § 486.303 to be eligible for designation.

          (c) An OPO must enter into an agreement with CMS in order for the organ procurement costs attributable to the OPO to be reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid.

          § 486.306   OPO service area size designation and documentation requirements.

#### § § 486.306

          (a)  An OPO must make available to CMS documentation verifying that the OPO meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section at the time of application and throughout the period of its designation.

          (b)  The defined service area either includes an entire metropolitan statistical area or a New England county metropolitan statistical area as specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or does not include any part of such an area.

          (c)  An OPO must define and document a proposed service area's location through the following information:

          (1) The names of counties (or parishes in Louisiana) served or, if the service area includes an entire State, the name of the State.

          (2) Geographic boundaries of the service area.

          (3) The number and the names of all hospitals and critical access hospitals in the service area that have both a ventilator and an operating room.

> [71 FR 31046, May 31, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 27156, May 12, 2014]

          § 486.308   Designation of one OPO for each service area.

#### § § 486.308

          (a) CMS designates only one OPO per service area. A service area is open for competition when the OPO for the service area is de-certified and all administrative appeals under § 486.314 are exhausted.

          (b) Designation periods—

          (1)  An OPO is normally designated for a 4-year agreement cycle. The period may be shorter, for example, if an OPO has voluntarily terminated its agreement with CMS and CMS selects a successor OPO for the balance of the 4-year agreement cycle. In rare situations, a designation period may be longer, for example, a designation may be extended if additional time is needed to select a successor OPO to replace an OPO that has been de-certified.

          (2)  Re-certification must occur not more frequently than once every 4 years.

          (c) Unless CMS has granted a hospital a waiver under paragraphs

          (d) through (f) of this section, the hospital must enter into an agreement only with the OPO designated to serve the area in which the hospital is located.

          (d) If CMS changes the OPO designated for an area, hospitals located in that area must enter into agreements with the newly designated OPO or submit a request for a waiver in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section within 30 days of notice of the change in designation.

          (e) A hospital may request and CMS may grant a waiver permitting the hospital to have an agreement with a designated OPO other than the OPO designated for the service area in which the hospital is located. To qualify for a waiver, the hospital must submit data to CMS establishing that—

          (1) The waiver is expected to increase organ donations; and

          (2) The waiver will ensure equitable treatment of patients listed for transplants within the service area served by the hospital's designated OPO and within the service area served by the OPO with which the hospital seeks to enter into an agreement.

          (f) In making a determination on waiver requests, CMS considers—

          (1) Cost effectiveness;

          (2) Improvements in quality;

          (3) Changes in a hospital's designated OPO due to changes in the definitions of metropolitan statistical areas, if applicable; and

          (4) The length and continuity of a hospital's relationship with an OPO other than the hospital's designated OPO.

          (g) A hospital may continue to operate under its existing agreement with an out-of-area OPO while CMS is processing the waiver request. If a waiver request is denied, a hospital must enter into an agreement with the designated OPO within 30 days of notification of the final determination.

> [71 FR 31046, May 31, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 27156, May 12, 2014]

          § 486.309   Re-certification from August 1, 2006 through July 31, 2010.

#### § § 486.309

          An OPO will be considered to be re-certified for the period of August 1, 2006 through July 31, 2010 if an OPO met the standards to be a qualified OPO within a 4-year period ending December 31, 2001 and has an agreement with the Secretary that is scheduled to terminate on July 31, 2006. Agreements based on the August 1, 2006 through July 31, 2010 re-certification cycle will end on January 31, 2011.

          § 486.310   Changes in control or ownership or service area.

#### § § 486.310

          (a)  (1) A designated OPO considering a change in control (see § 413.17(b)(3)) or ownership or in its service area must notify CMS before putting it into effect. This notification is required to ensure that the OPO, if changed, will continue to satisfy Medicare and Medicaid requirements. The merger of one OPO into another or the consolidation of one OPO with another is considered a change in control or ownership.

          (2) A designated OPO considering a change in its service area must obtain prior CMS approval. In the case of a service area change that results from a change of control or ownership due to merger or consolidation, the OPOs must resubmit the information required in an application for designation. The OPO must provide information specific to the board structure of the new organization, as well as operating budgets, financial information, and other written documentation CMS determines to be necessary for designation.

          (b)  (1) If CMS finds that the OPO has changed to such an extent that it no longer satisfies the requirements for OPO designation, CMS may de-certify the OPO and declare the OPO's service area to be an open area. An OPO may appeal such a de-certification as set forth in § 486.314. The OPO's service area is not opened for competition until the conclusion of the administrative appeals process.

          (2) If CMS finds that the changed OPO continues to satisfy the requirements for OPO designation, the period of designation of the changed OPO is the remaining portion of the 4-year term of the OPO that was reorganized. If more than one designated OPO is involved in the reorganization, the remaining designation term is the longest of the remaining periods unless CMS determines that a shorter period is in the best interest of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The changed OPO must continue to meet the requirements for certification at § 486.303 throughout the remaining period.

        Re-Certification and De-Certification

          § 486.312   De-certification.

#### § § 486.312

          (a)  If an OPO wishes to terminate its agreement, the OPO must send CMS written notice of its intention to terminate its agreement and the proposed effective date. CMS may approve the proposed date, set a different date no later than 6 months after the proposed effective date, or set a date less than 6 months after the proposed effective date if it determines that a different date would not disrupt services to the service area. If CMS determines that a designated OPO has ceased to furnish organ procurement services to its service area, the cessation of services is deemed to constitute a voluntary termination by the OPO, effective on a date determined by CMS. CMS will de-certify the OPO as of the effective date of the voluntary termination.

          (b)  During the term of the agreement, CMS may terminate an agreement with an OPO if the OPO no longer meets the requirements for certification at § 486.303. CMS may also terminate an agreement immediately in cases of urgent need, such as the discovery of unsound medical practices. CMS will de-certify the OPO as of the effective date of the involuntary termination.

          (c)  CMS will not voluntarily renew its agreement with an OPO if the OPO fails to meet the requirements for certification at § 486.318, based on findings from the most recent re-certification cycle, or the other requirements for certification at § 486.303. CMS will de-certify the OPO as of the ending date of the agreement.

          (d)  Except in cases of urgent need, CMS gives written notice of de-certification to an OPO at least 90 days before the effective date of the de-certification. In cases of urgent need, CMS gives written notice of de-certification to an OPO at least 3 calendar days prior to the effective date of the de-certification. The notice of de-certification states the reasons for de-certification and the effective date.

          (e)  Once CMS approves the date for a voluntary termination, the OPO must provide prompt public notice in the service area of the date of de-certification and such other information as CMS may require. In the case of involuntary termination or nonrenewal of an agreement, CMS also provides notice to the public in the service area of the date of de-certification. No payment under titles XVIII or XIX of the Act will be made with respect to organ procurement costs attributable to the OPO on or after the effective date of de-certification.

> [71 FR 31046, May 31, 2006, as amended at 82 FR 38515, Aug. 14, 2017]

          § 486.314   Appeals.

#### § § 486.314

          If an OPO's de-certification is due to involuntary termination or non-renewal of its agreement with CMS, the OPO may appeal the de-certification on substantive and procedural grounds.

          (a)  CMS mails notice to the OPO of an initial de-certification determination. The notice contains the reasons for the determination, the effect of the determination, and the OPO's right to seek reconsideration.

          (b)  (1) Filing request. If the OPO is dissatisfied with the de-certification determination, it has 15 business days from receipt of the notice of de-certification to seek reconsideration from CMS. The request for reconsideration must state the issues or findings of fact with which the OPO disagrees and the reasons for disagreement.

          (2) An OPO must seek reconsideration before it is entitled to seek a hearing before a hearing officer. If an OPO does not request reconsideration or its request is not made timely, the OPO has no right to further administrative review.

          (3)  CMS makes a written reconsidered determination within 10 business days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, affirming, reversing, or modifying the initial determination and the findings on which it was based. CMS augments the administrative record to include any additional materials submitted by the OPO, and a copy of the reconsideration decision and sends the supplemented administrative record to the CMS hearing officer.

          (c)  An OPO dissatisfied with the CMS reconsideration decision, must file a request for a hearing before a CMS hearing officer within 40 business days of receipt of the notice of the reconsideration determination. If an OPO does not request a hearing or its request is not received timely, the OPO has no right to further administrative review.

          (d)  The hearing officer sends the administrative record to both parties within 10 business days of receipt of the request for a hearing.

          (1) The administrative record consists of, but is not limited to, the following:

          (i) Factual findings from the survey(s) on the OPO conditions for coverage.

          (ii) Data from the outcome measures.

          (iii) Rankings of OPOs based on the outcome data.

          (iv) Correspondence between CMS and the affected OPO.

          (2) The administrative record will not include any privileged information.

          (e)  At any time before the hearing, the CMS hearing officer may call a pre-hearing conference if he or she believes that a conference would more clearly define the issues. At the pre-hearing conference, the hearing officer may establish the briefing schedule, sets the hearing date, and addresses other administrative matters. The hearing officer will issue an order reflecting the results of the pre-hearing conference.

          (f)  The hearing officer sets a date for the hearing that is no more than 60 calendar days following the receipt of the request for a hearing.

          (g)  (1) The hearing is open to both parties, CMS and the OPO.

          (2) The hearing officer inquires fully into all the matters at issue and receives in evidence the testimony of witnesses and any documents that are relevant and material.

          (3) The hearing officer provides the parties with an opportunity to enter an objection to the inclusion of any document. The hearing officer will consider the objection and will rule on the document's admissibility.

          (4) The hearing officer decides the order in which the evidence and the arguments of the parties are presented and the conduct of the hearing.

          (5) The hearing officer rules on the admissibility of evidence and may admit evidence that would be inadmissible under rules applicable to court procedures.

          (6) The hearing officer rules on motions and other procedural items.

          (7) The hearing officer regulates the course of the hearing and conduct of counsel.

          (8) The hearing officer may examine witnesses.

          (9) The hearing officer takes any action authorized by the rules in this subpart.

          (h) Parties' rights. CMS and the OPO may:

          (1) Appear by counsel or other authorized representative, in all hearing proceedings.

          (2) Participate in any pre-hearing conference held by the hearing officer.

          (3) Agree to stipulations as to facts which will be made a part of the record.

          (4) Make opening statements at the hearing.

          (5) Present relevant evidence on the issues at the hearing.

          (6) Present witnesses, who then must be available for cross-examination, and cross-examine witnesses presented by the other party.

          (7) Present oral arguments at the hearing.

          (i) Hearing officer's decision. The hearing officer renders a decision on the appeal of the notice of de-certification within 20 business days of the hearing.

          (1)  If the hearing officer reverses CMS' determination to de-certify an OPO in a case involving the involuntary termination of the OPO's agreement, CMS will not terminate the OPO's agreement and will not de-certify the OPO.

          (2)  If the de-certification determination is upheld by the hearing officer, the OPO is de-certified and it has no further administrative appeal rights.

          (j)  If there is insufficient time prior to expiration of an agreement with CMS to allow for competition of the service area and, if necessary, transition of the service area to a successor OPO, CMS may choose to extend the OPO's agreement with CMS.

          (k)  Medicare and Medicaid payments may not be made for organ procurement services the OPO furnishes on or after the effective date of de-certification. CMS will then open the de-certified OPO's service area for competition as set forth in § 486.316(c).

          § 486.316   Re-certification and competition processes.

#### § § 486.316

          (a)  Based upon performance on the outcome measures set forth in § 486.318 and the re-certification survey, each OPO will be designated into either Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3. The tier in which the OPO is designated will determine whether the OPO is re-certified (Tier 1), must compete to retain its DSA (Tier 2), or will receive an initial de-certification determination (Tier 3).

          (1)  An OPO is re-certified for at least an additional 4 years, the OPO's DSA is not opened for competition, and the OPO can compete for any open DSA if it meets all of the following:

          (i) It has been shown by survey to be in compliance with the requirements for certification at § 486.303, including the conditions for coverage at §§ 486.320 through 486.360; and

          (ii) It meets the outcome requirements as described in § 486.318(e)(4) for the final assessment period of the agreement cycle.

          (2)  An OPO's DSA is open for competition and the OPO is eligible to compete to retain its DSA and for any open DSA if it meets all of the following:

          (i) It has been shown by survey to be in compliance with the requirements for certification at § 486.303, including the conditions for coverage at §§ 486.320 through 486.360; and

          (ii) It meets the outcome requirements as described in § 486.318(e)(5) at the final assessment period of the agreement cycle.

          (3)  An OPO will receive a notice of de-certification determination under § 486.314 and cannot compete for any open DSA if it meets either of the following:

          (i) Has been shown by survey to not be in compliance with the requirements for certification at § 486.303, including the conditions for coverage at §§ 486.320 through 486.360; or

          (ii) Has outcome requirements as described in § 486.318(e)(6) at the final assessment period of the agreement cycle.

          (b)  If an OPO fails to meet the outcome measures set forth in § 486.318(e)(6) at the final assessment period prior to the end of the agreement cycle, or it meets the requirements described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

          (1) CMS will send the OPO a notice of its initial de-certification determination and the OPO has the right to appeal as established in § 486.314;

          (2) If the OPO does not appeal or the OPO appeals and the reconsideration official and CMS hearing officer uphold the de-certification, the OPO's service area is opened for competition from other OPOs that qualify to compete for open service areas as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The de-certified OPO is not permitted to compete for its open area or any other open area.

          (3) The OPO competing for the open service area must submit information and data that describe the barriers in its service area, how they affected organ donation, what steps the OPO took to overcome them, and the results.

          (c)  To compete for an open DSA, an OPO must meet the performance requirements of the outcome measures for Tier 1 or Tier 2 at § 486.318(e)(4) and (5), and the requirements for certification at § 486.303, including the conditions for coverage at §§ 486.320 through 486.360 at the most recent routine survey. The OPO must compete for the entire DSA.

          (d)  CMS will designate an OPO for an open service area based on the following criteria:

          (1) Performance on the outcome measures at § 486.318;

          (2) Relative success in meeting the process performance measures and other conditions at §§ 486.320 through 486.348;

          (3) Contiguity to the open service area.

          (4) Success in identifying and overcoming barriers to donation within its own service area and the relevance of those barriers to barriers in the open area. An OPO competing for an open service area must submit information and data that describe the barriers in its service area, how they affected organ donation, what steps the OPO took to overcome them, and the results.

          (e)  If no OPO applies to compete for a de-certified OPO's open area, CMS may select a single OPO to take over the entire open area or may adjust the service area boundaries of two or more contiguous OPOs to incorporate the open area. CMS will make its decision based on the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section.

          (f)  OPOs can seek a 1-year extension of the agreement cycle if there are extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the OPOs that has affected the data of the final assessment period so that it does not accurately capture their performance. OPOs must request this extension within 90 days of the end of the occurrence of the extraordinary circumstance but no later than the last day of the final assessment period.

          (g)  For the 2022 recertification cycle only, an OPO is recertified for an additional 4 years and its service area is not opened for competition when the OPO meets one out of the two outcome measure requirements described in § 486.318(a)(1) and (3) for OPOs not operating exclusively in the noncontiguous States, Commonwealths, Territories, or possessions; or § 486.318(b)(1) and (3) for OPOs operating exclusively in noncontiguous States, Commonwealths, Territories, and possessions. An OPO is not required to meet the second outcome measure described in § 486.318(a)(2) or (b)(2) for the 2022 recertification cycle. If an OPO does not meet one of the outcome measures as described in paragraphs § 486.318(a)(1), (a)(3), (b)(1), or (b)(3), or has been shown by survey to not be in compliance with the requirements for certification at § 486.303, including the conditions for coverage at §§ 486.320 through 486.360, the OPO is de-certified. If the OPO does not appeal or the OPO appeals and the reconsideration official and CMS hearing officer uphold the de-certification, the OPO's service area is opened for competition from other OPOs. The de-certified OPO is not permitted to compete for its open area or any other open area. An OPO competing for an open service area must submit information and data that describe the barriers in its service area, how they affected organ donation, what steps the OPO took to overcome them, and the results.

        Organ Procurement Organization Outcome Requirements

          § 486.318   Condition: Outcome measures.

#### § § 486.318

          (a) With the exception of OPOs operating exclusively in noncontiguous States, Commonwealths, Territories, or possessions, an OPO must meet two out of the three following outcome measures:

          (1) The OPO's donation rate of eligible donors as a percentage of eligible deaths is no more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean national donation rate of eligible donors as a percentage of eligible deaths, averaged over the 4 years of the re-certification cycle. Both the numerator and denominator of an individual OPO's donation rate ratio are adjusted by adding a 1 for each donation after cardiac death donor and each donor over the age of 70;

          (2) The observed donation rate is not significantly lower than the expected donation rate for 18 or more months of the 36 months of data used for re-certification, as calculated by the SRTR;

          (3) The OPO data reports, averaged over the 4 years of the recertification cycle, must meet the rules and requirements of the most current OPTN aggregate donor yield measure.

          (i) The initial criteria used to identify OPOs with lower than expected organ yield, for all organs as well as for each organ type, will include all of the following:

          (A) More than 10 fewer observed organs per 100 donors than expected yield (Observed per 100 donors—Expected per 100 donors <−10);

          (B) A ratio of observed to expected yield less than 0.90; and

          (C) A two-sided p-value is less than 0.05.

          (ii) The number of organs used for research per donor, including pancreata used for islet cell research.

          (4) The outcome measures described in § 486.318(a)(1) through (3) are effective until July 31, 2022.

          (b) For OPOs operating exclusively in noncontiguous States, Commonwealths, Territories, and possessions, an OPO must meet two out of the three following outcome measures:

          (1) The OPO's donation rate of eligible donors as a percentage of eligible deaths is no more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean national donation rate of eligible donors as a percentage of eligible deaths, averaged over the 4 years of the re-certification cycle. Both the numerator and denominator of an individual OPO's donation rate ratio are adjusted by adding a 1 for each donation after cardiac death donor and each donor over the age of 70;

          (2) The observed donation rate is not significantly lower than the expected donation rate for 18 or more months of the 36 months of data used for re-certification, as calculated by the SRTR;

          (3) The OPO data reports, averaged over the 4 years of the recertification cycle, must meet the rules and requirements of the most current OPTN aggregate donor yield measure.

          (i) The initial criteria used to identify OPOs with lower than expected organ yield, for all organs as well as for each organ type, will include all of the following:

          (A) More than 10 fewer observed organs per 100 donors than expected yield (Observed per 100 donors—Expected per 100 donors <−10);

          (B) A ratio of observed to expected yield less than 0.90; and

          (C) A two-sided p-value is less than 0.05.

          (ii) The number of organs used for research per donor, including pancreata used for islet cell research.

          (4) The outcome measures described in § 486.318(b)(1) through (3) are effective until July 31, 2022.

          (c) Data for the outcome measures.

          (1) An OPO's performance on the outcome measures is based on 36 months of data, beginning with January 1 of the first full year of the re-certification cycle and ending 36 months later on December 31, 7 months prior to the end of the re-certification cycle.

          (2) If an OPO takes over another OPO's service area on a date later than January 1 of the first full year of the re-certification cycle so that 36 months of data are not available to evaluate the OPO's performance in its new service area, we will not hold the OPO accountable for its performance in the new area until the end of the following re-certification cycle when 36 months of data are available.

          (3) An OPO's performance on the outcome measures described in § 486.318(a)(1) through (3) and § 486.318(b)(1) through (3) is based on the data described in § 486.318(c)(1) and (2) until July 31, 2022.

          (d) An OPO is evaluated by measuring the donation rate and the organ transplantation rate in their DSA.

          (1) For all OPOs, except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for all OPOs:

          (i) The donation rate is calculated as the number of donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential.

          (ii) The organ transplantation rate is calculated as the number of organs transplanted from donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential. The organ transplantation rate is adjusted for the average age of the donor potential.

          (iii) The numerator for the donation rate is the number of donors in the DSA. The numerator for the organ transplantation rate is the number of organs transplanted from donors in the DSA. The numbers of donors and organs transplanted are based on the data submitted to the OPTN as required in § 486.328 and § 121.11 of this title. For calculating each measure, the data used is from the same time period as the data for the donor potential.

          (iv) The denominator for the outcome measures is the donor potential and is based on inpatient deaths within the DSA from patients 75 or younger with a primary cause of death that is consistent with organ donation. The data is obtained from the most recent 12-months data from state death certificates.

          (2) For the OPO representing the Hawaii DSA:

          (i) The donation rate is calculated as the number of donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential.

          (ii) The kidney transplantation rate is calculated as the number of kidneys transplanted from kidney donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential.

          (iii) The numerator for the donation rate is the number of donors in the DSA. The numerator for the kidney transplantation rate is the number of kidneys transplanted from kidney donors in the DSA. The numbers of donors and kidneys transplanted are based on the data submitted to the OPTN as required in § 486.328 and § 121.11 of this title. For calculating each measure, the data used is from the same time period as the data for the donor potential.

          (iv) The denominator for the outcome measures is the donor potential and is based on inpatient deaths within the DSA from patients 75 or younger with a primary cause of death that is consistent with organ donation. The data is obtained from the most recent 12-months data from state death certificates.

          (e) An OPO must demonstrate a success rate on the outcome measures in accordance with the following parameters and requirements:

          (1) For each assessment period, threshold rates will be established based on donation rates during the 12-month period immediately prior to the period being evaluated:

          (i) The lowest rate among the top 25 percent in DSAs, and

          (ii) The median rate among the DSAs.

          (2) For each assessment period, threshold rates will be established based on the organ transplantation or kidney transplantation rates during the 12-month period prior to the period being evaluated:

          (i) The lowest rate among the top 25 percent, and

          (ii) The median rate among the DSAs.

          (3) The 95 percent confidence interval for each DSA's donation and organ transplantation rates will be calculated using a one-sided test.

          (4) Tier 1—OPOs that have an upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for their donation and organ transplantation rates that are at or above the top 25 percent threshold rate established for their DSA will be identified at each assessment period.

          (5) Tier 2—OPOs that have an upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for their donation and organ transplantation rates that are at or above the median threshold rate established for their DSA but is not in Tier 1 as described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section will be identified at each assessment period.

          (6) Tier 3—OPOs that have an upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for their donation or organ transplantation rates that are below the median threshold rate established for their DSA will be identified at each assessment period. OPOs that have an upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for their donation and organ transplantation rates that are below the median threshold rate for their DSA are also included in Tier 3.

          (7) For the OPO exclusively serving the DSA that includes the non-contiguous state of Hawaii and surrounding territories, the kidney transplantation rate will be used instead of the organ transplantation rate. The comparative performance and designation to a Tier will be the same as in paragraphs (e)(4), (5), and (6) of this section except kidney transplantation rates will be used.

          (f)(1) An OPO's performance on the outcome measures is based on an evaluation at least every 12 months, with the most recent 12 months of data available from the OPTN and state death certificates, beginning January 1 of the first year of the agreement cycle and ending December 31, prior to the end of the agreement cycle.

          (2) An assessment period is the most recent 12 months prior to the evaluation of the outcome measures in which data is available.

          (3) If an OPO takes over another OPO's DSA on a date later than January 1 of the first year of the agreement cycle so that 12 months of data are not available to evaluate the OPO's performance in its new DSA, we will hold the OPO accountable for its performance on the outcome measures in the new area once 12 months of data are available.

          (d) Data reported by the OPO to the OPTN must be reported within 30 days after the end of the month in which a death occurred. If an OPO determines through death record review or other means that the data it reported to the OPTN was incorrect, it must report the corrected data to the OPTN within 30 days of the end of the month in which the error is identified.

          (e) For the purpose of determining the information to be collected under paragraph (a) of this section, the following definitions apply:

          (1)  Each kidney recovered will be counted individually. En bloc kidneys recovered will count as two kidneys procured.

          (2)  Each kidney transplanted will be counted individually. En bloc kidney transplants will be counted as two kidneys transplanted.

          (3)  Each organ recovered is counted individually.

          (4)  Each organ or part thereof transplanted will be counted individually. For example, a single liver is counted as one organ procured and each portion that is transplanted will count as one transplant. Further, a heart and double lung transplant will be counted as three organs transplanted. A kidney/pancreas transplant will count as one kidney transplanted and one extra-renal organ transplanted.

        § 486.301   Basis and scope.

#### § § 486.301

        (a)  (1) Section 1138(b) of the Act sets forth the requirements that an organ procurement organization (OPO) must meet to have its organ procurement services to hospitals covered under Medicare and Medicaid. These include certification as a “qualified” OPO and designation as the OPO for a particular service area.

        (2) Section 371(b) of the Public Health Service Act sets forth the requirements for certification and the functions that a qualified OPO is expected to perform.

        (3) Section 1102 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make and publish rules and regulations necessary to the efficient administration of the functions that are assigned to the Secretary under the Act.

        (4) Section 1871 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the Medicare program under title XVIII.

        (b)  This subpart sets forth—

        (1) The conditions and requirements that an OPO must meet;

        (2) The procedures for certification and designation of OPOs; and

        (3) The terms of the agreement with CMS and the basis for and the effect of de-certification.

        (4) The requirements for an OPO to be re-certified.

        § 486.302   Definitions.

#### § § 486.302

        As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:

        means an untoward, undesirable, and usually unanticipated event that causes death or serious injury or the risk thereof. As applied to OPOs, adverse events include but are not limited to transmission of disease from a donor to a beneficiary, avoidable loss of a medically suitable potential donor for whom consent for donation has been obtained, or delivery to a transplant center of the wrong organ or an organ whose blood type does not match the blood type of the intended beneficiary.

        refers to the time period of at least 4 years when an agreement is in effect between CMS and an OPO.

        is a 12-month period in which an OPO's outcome measures will be evaluated for performance. The final assessment period is the 12-month assessment period used to calculate outcome measures for re-certification.

        means a CMS determination that an OPO meets the requirements for certification at § 486.303.

        means an assessment of the medical chart of a deceased patient to evaluate potential for organ donation.

        means all deaths from the state death certificates with the primary cause of death listed as the ICD-10-CM codes I20-I25 (ischemic heart disease); I60-I69 (cerebrovascular disease); V-1-Y89 (external causes of death): Blunt trauma, gunshot wounds, drug overdose, suicide, drowning, and asphyxiation.

        means a CMS determination that an OPO no longer meets the requirements for certification at § 486.303.

        is an individual (generally employed by a hospital), who is trained to handle or participate in the donation consent process. The designated requestor may request consent for donation from the family of a potential donor or from the individual(s) responsible for making the donation decision in circumstances permitted under State law, provide information about donation to the family or decision-maker(s), or provide support to or collaborate with the OPO in the donation consent process.

        means CMS assignment of a geographic service area to an OPO. Once an OPO is certified and assigned a geographic service area, organ procurement costs of the OPO are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid payment under section 1138(b)(1)(F) of the Act.

        is the number of donors as a percentage of the donor potential.

        means a geographical area of sufficient size to ensure maximum effectiveness in the procurement and equitable distribution of organs and that either includes an entire metropolitan statistical area or does not include any part of such an area and that meets the standards of this subpart.

        means a deceased individual from whom at least one vascularized organ (heart, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, or intestine) is transplanted. An individual also would be considered a donor if only the pancreas is procured and is used for research or islet cell transplantation.

        means an individual who donates after his or her heart has irreversibly stopped beating. A donor after cardiac death may be termed a non-heartbeating or asystolic donor.

        means any documented indication of an individual's choice regarding his or her wishes concerning organ and/or tissue donation that was made by that individual or another authorized individual in accordance with any applicable State law.”

        is the number of inpatient deaths within the DSA among patients 75 and younger with a primary cause of death that is consistent with organ donation. For OPOs servicing a hospital with a waiver under § 486.308(e), the donor potential of the county for that hospital will be adjusted using the proportion of Medicare beneficiary inpatient deaths in the hospital compared with the total Medicare beneficiary inpatient deaths in the county.

        means a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA), or a primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) listed in the State and Metropolitan Area Data Book published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. CMS does not recognize a CMSA as a metropolitan area for the purposes of establishing a geographical area for an OPO.

        is the number of kidneys transplanted from kidney donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential.

        will be calculated by taking the number of total DSAs in the time period identified for establishing the threshold rate. The total number of DSAs will be multiplied by 0.25 and rounded to the closest integer (0.5 will round to the higher integer). The donation rates and organ transplantation rates in each DSA will be separately ranked and the threshold rate will be the rate that corresponds to that integer when counting down the ranking.

        area means an OPO service area for which CMS has notified the public that it is accepting applications for designation.

        means a human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestine (or multivisceral organs when transplanted at the same time as an intestine). The pancreas counts as an organ even if it is used for research or islet cell transplantation.

        means an organization that performs or coordinates the procurement, preservation, and transport of organs and maintains a system for locating prospective beneficiaries for available organs.

        is the number of organs transplanted from donors in the DSA as a percentage of the donor potential. Organs transplanted into patients on the OPTN waiting list as part of research are included in the organ transplantation rate. The organ transplantation rate will be risk-adjusted for the average age of the donor potential using the following methodology:

        (1) The age groups used for the adjusted transplantation rates are: <1, 1-5, 6-11, 12-17, 18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-75.

        (2) Calculate a national age-specific transplantation rate for each age group.

        An expected transplantation rate for each OPO is calculated as ∑(g=1)Gdg*Rg/∑gdg, where dg is the number of potential donors in the OPO in age group g, Rg is the age-specific national transplantation rate in age group g, and ∑gdg is the OPO's total number of individuals in the donor potential. This can be interpreted as the overall expected transplantation rate for an OPO if each of its age-specific transplantation rates were equal to the national age-specific.

        (3) Calculate the age-adjusted organ transplantation rate as (O/E)*P, where O is the OPO's observed unadjusted transplantation rate, E is the expected transplantation rate calculated in Step 2, and P is the unadjusted national transplantation rate.

        means the 4-year cycle during which an OPO is certified.

        means a hospital that provides organ transplants and other medical and surgical specialty services required for the care of transplant patients. There may be one or more types of organ transplant centers operating within the same transplant hospital.

        occurs when an OPO's noncompliance with one or more conditions for coverage has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a potential or actual donor or an organ beneficiary.

        § 488.7   Release and use of accreditation surveys.

#### § § 488.7

        A Medicare participating provider or supplier deemed to meet program requirements in accordance with § 488.4 must authorize its accrediting organization to release to CMS a copy of its most current accreditation survey and any information related to the survey that CMS may require (including, but not limited to, corrective action plans).

        (a) CMS may determine that a provider or supplier does not meet the applicable Medicare conditions or requirements on the basis of its own investigation of the accreditation survey or any other information related to the survey.

        (b) With the exception of home health agency and hospice program surveys, general disclosure of an accrediting organization's survey information is prohibited under section 1865(b) of the Act. CMS may publicly disclose an accreditation survey and information related to the survey, upon written request, to the extent that the accreditation survey and survey information are related to an enforcement action taken by CMS.

        (c) CMS posts inspection reports from a State or local survey agency or accrediting organization conducted on or after October 1, 2022, for hospice programs, including copies of a hospice program's survey deficiencies, and enforcement actions (for example, involuntary terminations) taken as a result of such surveys, on its public website in a manner that is prominent, easily accessible, readily understandable, and searchable for the general public and allows for timely updates.

        § 488.8   Ongoing review of accrediting organizations.

#### § § 488.8

        (a)  In accordance with section 1875(b) of the Act, CMS evaluates the performance of each CMS-approved accreditation program on an ongoing basis. This review includes, but is not limited to the following:

        (1) Review of the organization's survey activity.

        (2) Analysis of the results of the validation surveys under § 488.9(a)(1), including the rate of disparity between certifications of the accrediting organization and certifications of the SA.

        (3) Review of the organization's continued fulfillment of the requirements in § 488.5(a).

        (b)  CMS assesses the equivalency of an accrediting organization's CMS-approved program requirements to the comparable Medicare requirements if the following conditions exist:

        (1) CMS imposes new Medicare certification requirements or changes its survey process.

        (i) CMS provides written notice of the changes to the affected accrediting organization.

        (ii) CMS specifies in its written notice a timeframe, not less than 30 calendar days from the date of the notice, for the accrediting organization to submit its proposed equivalent changes, including its implementation timeframe, for CMS review. CMS may extend the deadline after due consideration of a written request for extension by the accrediting organization, submitted prior to the original deadline.

        (iii) After completing the comparability review CMS provides written notification to the organization whether or not the accreditation program, including the proposed revisions and implementation timeframe, continues to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements.

        (iv) If, no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the organization's proposed changes, CMS does not provide the written notice to the organization required in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, then the revised program will be deemed to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements and to have continued CMS approval.

        (v) If an organization fails to submit its proposed changes within the required timeframe, or fails to implement the proposed changes that have been determined by CMS or deemed to be comparable, CMS may open an accreditation program review in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2) An accrediting organization proposes to adopt new requirements or to change its survey process.

        (i) An accrediting organization must provide written notice to CMS of any proposed changes in its accreditation requirements or survey process and must not implement any changes before receiving CMS's approval, except as provided below.

        (ii) If, no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the organization's proposed changes, CMS does not provide written notice to the organization that the accreditation program, including the proposed revisions, continues or does not continue to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements, then the revised program will be deemed to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements and to have continued CMS approval.

        (iii) If an organization implements changes that have neither been determined by CMS nor deemed to be comparable to the applicable Medicare requirements, CMS may open an accreditation program review in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  If a comparability or performance review reveals evidence of substantial non-compliance of an accrediting organization's CMS-approved accreditation program with the requirements of this subpart, CMS may initiate an accreditation program review.

        (1) If an accreditation program review is initiated, CMS provides written notice to the organization indicating that its CMS-approved accreditation program approval may be in jeopardy and that an accreditation program review is being initiated. The notice provides all of the following information:

        (i) A statement of the instances, rates or patterns of non-compliance identified, as well as other related information, if applicable.

        (ii) A description of the process to be followed during the review, including a description of the opportunities for the accrediting organization to offer factual information related to CMS's findings.

        (iii) A description of the possible actions that may be imposed by CMS based on the findings of the accreditation program review.

        (iv) The actions the accrediting organization must take to address the identified deficiencies including a timeline for implementation not to exceed 180 calendar days after receipt of the notice that CMS is initiating an accreditation program review.

        (2) CMS reviews the accrediting organization's plan of correction for acceptability.

        (3) If CMS determines as a result of the accreditation program review or a review of an application for renewal of an existing CMS-approved accreditation program that the accrediting organization has failed to meet any of the requirements of this subpart, CMS may place the accrediting organization's CMS-approved accreditation program on probation for a period up to 180 calendar days to implement corrective actions, not to exceed the accrediting organization's current term of approval. In the case of a renewal application where CMS has placed the accreditation program on probation, CMS indicates that any approval of the application is conditional while the program is placed on probation.

        (i) Within 60 calendar days after the end of any probationary period, CMS issues a written determination to the accrediting organization as to whether or not a CMS-approved accreditation program continues to meet the requirements of this subpart, including the reasons for the determination.

        (ii) If CMS has determined that the accrediting organization does not meet the requirements, CMS withdraws approval of the CMS-approved accreditation program. The notice of determination provided to the accrediting organization includes notice of the removal of approval, reason for the removal, including the effective date determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

        (iii) CMS publishes in the  a notice of its decision to withdraw approval of a CMS-approved accreditation program, including the reasons for the withdrawal, effective 60 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice.

        (d)  If at any time CMS determines that the continued approval of a CMS-approved accreditation program of any accrediting organization poses an immediate jeopardy to the patients of the entities accredited under that program, or the continued approval otherwise constitutes a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may immediately withdraw the approval of a CMS-approved accreditation program of that accrediting organization and publish a notice of the removal, including the reasons for it, in the .

        (e)  An accrediting organization whose CMS approval of its accreditation program has been withdrawn must notify, in writing, each of its accredited providers or suppliers of the withdrawal of CMS approval and the implications in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section for the providers' or suppliers' deemed status no later than 30 calendar days after the notice is published in the .

        (f)  Any accrediting organization dissatisfied with a determination to withdraw CMS approval of its accreditation program may request a reconsideration of that determination in accordance with subpart D of this part.

        (g) —(1)  After CMS removes approval of an accrediting organization's accreditation program, an affected provider's or supplier's deemed status continues in effect for 180 calendar days after the removal of the approval if the provider or supplier submits an application to another CMS-approved accreditation program within 60 calendar days from the date of publication of the removal notice in the  The provider or supplier must also provide written notice to the SA that it has submitted an application for accreditation under another CMS-approved accreditation program within this same 60-calendar day timeframe. Failure to comply with the timeframe requirements specified in this section will place the provider or supplier under the SAs authority for continued participation in Medicare and on-going monitoring.

        (2)  When an accrediting organization has voluntarily terminated its CMS-approved accreditation program and provides its accredited providers and suppliers the notice required at § 488.5(a)(17), an affected provider's or supplier's deemed status continues in effect for 180 calendar days after the termination effective date if the provider or supplier submits an application to another CMS-approved accreditation program within 60 calendar days from the date of the notice from the accrediting organization. The provider or supplier must also provide written notice to the SA that it has submitted an application for accreditation under another CMS-approved accreditation program within this same 60-calendar day timeframe. Failure to comply with the timeframe requirements specified in this section will place the provider or supplier under the SAs authority for continued participation in Medicare and on-going monitoring.

        (h)  As part of the application review process, the ongoing review process, or the continuing oversight of an accrediting organization's performance, CMS may conduct at any time an onsite inspection of the accrediting organization's operations and offices to verify the organization's representations and to assess the organization's compliance with its own policies and procedures. The onsite inspection may include, but is not limited to, the review of documents, auditing meetings concerning the accreditation process, observation of surveys, the evaluation of survey results or the accreditation decision-making process, and interviews with the organization's staff.

        § 488.9   Validation surveys.

#### § § 488.9

        (a)  CMS may require a survey of an accredited provider or supplier to validate the accrediting organization's CMS-approved accreditation process. These surveys are conducted on a representative sample basis, or in response to substantial allegations of non-compliance.

        (1) For a representative sample, the survey may be comprehensive and address all Medicare conditions or requirements, or it may be focused on a specific condition(s) as determined by CMS.

        (2) For a substantial allegation of noncompliance, the SA surveys for any condition(s) or requirement(s) that CMS determines is related to the allegations.

        (b)  (1) A provider or supplier selected for a validation survey must cooperate with the SA that performs the validation survey.

        (2) If a provider or supplier selected for a validation survey fails to cooperate with the SA, it will no longer be deemed to meet the Medicare conditions or requirements, but will be subject to a review by the SA in accordance with § 488.10(a), and may be subject to termination of its provider agreement under § 489.53 of this chapter.

        (c)  (1) If a CMS validation survey results in a finding that the provider or supplier is out of compliance with one or more Medicare conditions or requirements, the provider or supplier will no longer be deemed to meet the Medicare conditions or requirements and will be subject to ongoing review by the SA in accordance with § 488.10(a) until the provider or supplier demonstrates compliance.

        (2) CMS may take actions for the deficiencies identified in the state validation survey in accordance with § 488.24, or may first direct the SA to conduct another survey of the provider's or supplier's compliance with specified Medicare conditions or requirements before taking the enforcement actions provided for at § 488.24.

        (3) If CMS determines that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with applicable Medicare conditions or requirements, the provider or supplier may be subject to termination of the provider or supplier agreement under § 489.53 of this chapter or of the supplier agreement in accordance with the applicable supplier conditions and any other applicable intermediate sanctions and remedies.

        (d)  An accredited provider or supplier will be deemed to meet the applicable Medicare conditions or requirements in accordance with this section if all of the following requirements are met:

        (1) It withdraws any prior refusal to authorize its accrediting organization to release a copy of the provider's or supplier's current accreditation survey.

        (2) It withdraws any prior refusal to allow a validation survey, if applicable.

        (3) CMS finds that the provider or supplier meets all applicable Medicare CoP, CfC, conditions of certification, or requirements.

        (e)  The existence of any performance review, comparability review, deemed status review, probationary period, or any other action by CMS, does not affect or limit conducting any validation survey.

When the State agency certifies to the Secretary that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with the conditions or requirements (for SNFs and NFs), and therefore not eligible to participate in the program, such documentation includes, in addition to the description of the specific deficiencies which resulted in the agency's recommendation, any provider or supplier response.

        (b) If a provider or supplier is certified by the State agency as in compliance with the conditions or participation requirements (for SNFs and NFs) or as meeting the requirements for special certification (see § 488.54), with deficiencies not adversely affecting the health and safety of patients, the following information will be incorporated into the finding:

        (1) A statement of the deficiencies that were found.

        (2) A description of further action that is required to remove the deficiencies.

        (a) Additional rules for certification of compliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in § 488.330.

        (b) The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or condition for coverage depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition. Evaluation of a provider's or supplier's performance against these standards enables the State survey agency to document the nature and extent of deficiencies, if any, with respect to a particular function, and to assess the need for improvement in relation to the prescribed conditions.

        (c) The State survey agency must adhere to the following principles in determining compliance with participation requirements:

        (1) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards;

        (2) The survey process uses resident and patient outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance process of facilities and agencies. Specifically, surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents and/or patients, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents and/or patients.

        (3) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;

        (4) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;

        (5) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.

        (d) The State survey agency must use the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by CMS.

        (e) The State survey agency must ensure that a facility's or agency's actual provision of care and services to residents and patients and the effects of that care on such residents and patients are assessed in a systematic manner.

        (a) If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient in one or more of the standards in the conditions of participation, conditions for coverage, or conditions for certification or requirements, it may participate in, or be covered under, the Medicare program only if the provider or supplier has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance within a reasonable period of time acceptable to CMS. In the case of an immediate jeopardy situation, CMS may require a shorter time period for achieving compliance.

        (b) The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in combination neither jeopardize the health and safety of patients nor are of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to render adequate care.

        (c)(1) If it is determined during a survey that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards, it is granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance.

        (2) The amount of time depends upon the—

        (i) Nature of the deficiency; and

        (ii) State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the facility to provide adequate and safe care.

        (d) Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being notified of the deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional time be granted by the Secretary in individual situations, if in its judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for example, a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or engage in competitive bidding.

        means a complaint survey that results in the proof or finding of noncompliance at the time of the survey, a finding that noncompliance was proven to exist, but was corrected prior to the survey, and includes any deficiency that is cited during a complaint survey, whether or not the cited deficiency was the original subject of the complaint.

        (b)  (1) The provider or supplier will be assessed a revisit user fee based upon one or more of the following:

        (i) The average cost per provider or supplier type.

        (ii) The type of revisit survey conducted (onsite or offsite).

        (iii) The size of the provider or supplier.

        (iv) The number of follow-up revisits resulting from uncorrected deficiencies.

        (v) The seriousness and number of deficiencies.

        (2) CMS may adjust the fees to account for any regional differences in cost.

        (c)  CMS must publish in the  the proposed and final notices of a uniform fee schedule before it assesses revised revisit user fees. The notices must set forth which criteria will be used and how, as well as the amounts of the assessed fees based on the criteria as identified in paragraph (b) of this subpart.

        (d)  (1) Fees for revisit surveys under this section may be deducted from amounts otherwise payable to the provider or supplier. As they are collected, fees will be deposited as an offset collection to be used exclusively for survey and certification activities conducted by State survey agencies pursuant to section 1864 of the Act or by CMS, and will be available for CMS until expended. CMS may devise other collection methods as it deems appropriate. In determining these methods, CMS will consider efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience for the providers, suppliers, and CMS. CMS may consider any method allowed by law, including: Credit card; electronic fund transfer; check; money order; and offset collections from claims submitted.

        (2) Fees for revisit surveys under this section are not allowable items on a cost report, as identified in part 413, subpart B of this chapter, under title XVIII of the Act.

        (3) Fees for revisit surveys will be due for any revisit surveys conducted during the time period for which authority to levy a revisit user fee exists.

        (e)  (1) CMS will review a request for reconsideration of an assessed revisit user fee—

        (i) If a provider or supplier believes an error of fact has been made in the application of the revisit user fee, such as clerical errors, billing for a fee already paid, or assessment of a fee when there was no revisit conducted, and

        (ii) If the request for reconsideration is received by CMS within 14 calendar days from the date identified on the revisit user fee assessment notice.

        (2) CMS will issue a credit toward any future revisit surveys conducted, if the provider or supplier has remitted an assessed revisit user fee and for which a reconsideration request is found in favor of the provider or supplier. If in the event that CMS judges that a significant amount of time has elapsed before such a credit is used, CMS will refund the assessed revisit user fee amount paid to the provider or supplier.

        (3) CMS will not reconsider the assessment of revisit user fees that request reconsideration of the survey findings or deficiency citations that may have given rise to the revisit, the revisit findings, the need for the revisit itself, or other similarly identified basis for the assessment of the revisit user fee.

        (f)  If the full revisit user fee payment is not received within 30 calendar days from the date identified on the revisit user fee assessment notice, CMS may terminate the facility's provider agreement (pursuant to § 489.53(a)(16) of this chapter) and enrollment in the Medicare program or the supplier's enrollment and participation in the Medicare program (pursuant to § 424.535(a)(1) of this chapter).

      Subpart B—Special Requirements

        § 488.52   [Reserved]

#### § § 488.52

        § 488.54   Temporary waivers applicable to hospitals.

#### § § 488.54

        (a)  If a hospital is found to be out of compliance with one or more conditions of participation for hospitals, as specified in part 482 of this chapter, a temporary waiver may be granted by CMS. CMS may extend a temporary waiver only if such a waiver would not jeopardize or adversely affect the health and safety of patients. The waiver may be issued for any one year period or less under certain circumstances. The waiver may be withdrawn earlier if CMS determines this action is necessary to protect the health and safety of patients. A waiver may be granted only if:

        (1) The hospital is located in a rural area. This includes all areas not delineated as “urban” by the Bureau of the Census, based on the most recent census;

        (2) The hospital has 50 or fewer inpatient hospital beds;

        (3) The character and seriousness of the deficiencies do not adversely affect the health and safety of patients; and

        (4) The hospital has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with personnel requirements consistent with any waiver.

        (b)  Each case will have to be decided on its individual merits, and while the degree and extent of compliance will vary, the institution must, as a minimum, meet all of the statutory conditions in section 1861(e)(1)-(8), in addition to meeting such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary under section 1861(e)(9). (For further information relating to the exception in section 1861(e)(5) of the Act, see paragraph (c) of this section.)

        (c)  CMS may waive the requirement contained in section 1861(e)(5) that a hospital must provide 24-hour nursing service furnished or supervised by a registered nurse. Such a waiver may be granted when the following criteria are met:

        (1) The hospital's failure to comply fully with the 24-hour nursing requirement is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing personnel in the area in which the hospital is located.

        (2) A registered nurse is present on the premises to furnish or supervise the nursing services during at least the daytime shift, 7 days a week.

        (3) The hospital has in charge, on all tours of duty not covered by a registered nurse, a licensed practical (vocational) nurse.

        (4) The hospital complies with all requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d)  CMS may waive technical personnel requirements, issued under section 1861(e)(9) of the Act, contained in the Conditions of Participation; Hospitals (part 482 of this chapter). Such a waiver must take into account the availability of technical personnel and the educational opportunities for technical personnel in the area in which the hospital is located. CMS may also limit the scope of services furnished by a hospital in conjunction with the waiver in order not to adversely affect the health and safety of the patients. In addition, the hospital must also comply with all requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 488.56   Temporary waivers applicable to skilled nursing facilities.

#### § § 488.56

        (a)  To the extent that § 483.35 of this chapter requires any skilled nursing facility to engage the services of a registered nurse more than 40 hours a week, the Secretary may waive such requirement for such periods as he deems appropriate if, based upon documented findings of the State agency, he determines that:

        (1) Such facility is located in a rural area and the supply of skilled nursing facility services in such area is not sufficient to meet the needs of individual patients therein,

        (2) Such facility has at least one fulltime registered nurse who is regularly on duty at such facility 40 hours a week, and

        (3) Such facility (i) has only patients whose attending physicians have indicated (through physicians' orders or admission notes) that each such patient does not require the services of a registered nurse for a 48-hour period, or (ii) has made arrangements for a registered nurse or a physician to spend such time at the facility as is determined necessary by the patient's attending physician to provide necessary services on days when the regular fulltime registered nurse is not on duty.

        (4) Such facility has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with the more than 40-hour registered nurse requirement, but such compliance is impeded by the unavailability of registered nurses in the area.

        (b)  To the extent that § 483.70(h) of this chapter requires any skilled nursing facility to engage the services of a medical director either part-time or full-time, the Secretary may waive such requirement for such periods as he deems appropriate if, based upon documented findings of the State agency, he determines that:

        (1) Such facility is located in an area where the supply of physicians is not sufficient to permit compliance with this requirement without seriously reducing the availability of physician services within the area, and

        (2) Such facility has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with § 483.70(h) of this chapter, but such compliance is impeded by the unavailability of physicians in the area.

        § 488.60   Special procedures for approving end stage renal disease facilities.

#### § § 488.60

        (a)  An ESRD facility that wishes to be approved or that wishes an expansion of dialysis services to be approved for coverage, in accordance with part 494 of this chapter, must secure a determination by the Secretary. To secure a determination, the facility must submit the following documents and data for consideration by the Secretary:

        (1) Certification by the State agency referred to in § 488.12 of this part.

        (2) Data furnished by ESRD network organizations and recommendations of the Public Health Service concerning the facility's contribution to the ESRD services of the network.

        (3) Data concerning the facility's compliance with professional norms and standards.

        (4) Data pertaining to the facility's qualifications for approval or for any expansion of services.

        (b) —(1)  A facility which meets minimal utilization requirements will be assigned this status as long as it continues to meet these requirements.

        (2)  A conditional status may be granted to a facility for not more than four consecutive calendar years and will not be renewable (see § 405.2122(b) of this chapter). Its status may be examined each calendar year to ascertain its compliance with Subpart U.

        (3)  Under unusual circumstances (see § 405.2122 (b) of this chapter) the Secretary may grant a time-limited exception to a facility which is not in compliance with the minimal utilization rate(s) for either unconditional status or conditional status. This exception status may be granted, and may be renewed on an annual basis, under circumstances where rigid application of minimal utilization rate requirements would adversely affect the achievement of ESRD program objectives.

        (c)  A facility which has not previously participated in the ESRD program must submit a plan detailing how it expects to meet the conditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the second calendar year of its operation under the program and meet the unconditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the fourth calendar year of its operation under the program.

        (d)  The Secretary will notify each facility and its network coordinating council of its initial and its subsequent minimal utilization rate classification.

        (e)  A facility failing to meet standards for unconditional status or conditional status, or if applicable, for exception status, will be so notified at the time of such classification.

        (f)  A facility previously participating under the interim regulations will not be approved under the program established by subpart U until it has demonstrated that it meets all the applicable requirements of this subpart, including the appropriate minimal utilization rate. It may continue under the interim program only for a period not to exceed 1 year from the effective date of these amendments (see § 405.2100(c) of this chapter). During this period it may demonstrate its ability to meet the appropriate minimal utilization rate. Failure to qualify under this subpart will automatically terminate coverage of such facility's services under the ESRD program at the end of such year.

        § 488.61   Special procedures for approval and re-approval of organ transplant programs.

#### § § 488.61

        For the purposes of this subpart, the survey, certification, and enforcement procedures described at 42 CFR part 488, subpart A apply to transplant programs, including the periodic review of compliance and approval described at § 488.20.

        (a)  A transplant program, including a kidney transplant program, may submit a request to CMS for Medicare approval at any time.

        (1) The request, signed by a person authorized to represent the center (for example, a chief executive officer), must include:

        (i) The hospital's Medicare provider I.D. number;

        (ii) Name(s) of the designated primary transplant surgeon and primary transplant physician; and,

        (iii) A statement from the OPTN that the center has complied with all data submission requirements.

        (2) To determine compliance with the clinical experience and outcome requirements at §§ 482.80(b) and 482.80(c), CMS will review the data contained in the most recent OPTN Data Report and 1-year patient and graft survival data contained in the most recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) program-specific report.

        (3) If CMS determines that a transplant center has not met the data submission, clinical experience, or outcome requirements, CMS may deny the request for approval or may review the center's compliance with the conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.76 and §§ 482.90 through 482.104 of this chapter, using the procedures described at 42 CFR part 488, subpart A, to determine whether the center's request will be approved. CMS will notify the transplant center in writing whether it is approved and, if approved, of the effective date of its approval.

        (4) CMS will consider mitigating factors in accordance with paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section.

        (5) If CMS determines that a transplant program has met the data submission, clinical experience, and outcome requirements, CMS will review the program's compliance with the conditions of participation contained at §§ 482.72 through 482.76 and §§ 482.90 through 482.104 of this chapter using the procedures described in subpart A of this part. If the transplant program is found to be in compliance with all the conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.104 of this chapter, CMS will notify the transplant program in writing of the effective date of its Medicare-approval. CMS will notify the transplant program in writing if it is not Medicare-approved.

        (6) A kidney transplant center may submit a request for initial approval after performing at least 3 transplants over a 12-month period.

        (b)  (1) A transplant center that wants to continue to be Medicare approved must be in compliance with the conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.104 as of June 28, 2007 and submit a request to CMS for Medicare approval under the conditions of participation no later than December 26, 2007, using the process described in paragraph (a)(1) of the section.

        (2) CMS will determine whether to approve the transplant center, using the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section. Until CMS makes a determination whether to approve the transplant center under the conditions of participation at §§ 482.72 through 482.104, the transplant center will continue to be Medicare approved under the end stage renal disease (ESRD) conditions for coverage (CfCs) in part 405, subpart U of this chapter for kidney transplant centers or the pertinent national coverage decisions (NCDs) for extra-renal organ transplant centers, as applicable, and the transplant center will continue to be reimbursed for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

        (3) Once CMS approves a kidney transplant center under the conditions of participation, the ESRD CfCs no longer apply to the center as of the date of its approval. Once CMS approves an extra-renal organ transplant center under the conditions of participation, the NCDs no longer apply to the center as of the date of its approval.

        (4) If a transplant center that is Medicare approved as of June 28, 2007 submits a request for approval under the CoPs at §§ 482.72 through 482.104 of this chapter but CMS does not approve the transplant center, or if the transplant center does not submit its request to CMS for Medicare approval under the CoPs by December 26, 2007, CMS will revoke the transplant center's approval under the conditions for coverage for kidney transplant centers or the national coverage decisions for extra-renal transplant centers, as applicable, and the transplant center will no longer be reimbursed for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS will notify the transplant center in writing of the effective date of its loss of Medicare approval.

        (c)  Programs that have lost their Medicare approval may seek re-entry into the Medicare program at any time. A program that has lost its Medicare approval must:

        (1) Request initial approval using the procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Be in compliance with §§ 482.72 through 482.104 of this chapter at the time of the request for Medicare approval; and

        (3) Submit a report to CMS documenting any changes or corrective actions taken by the program as a result of the loss of its Medicare approval status.

        (d)  A transplant program may remain inactive and retain its Medicare approval for a period not to exceed 12 months. A transplant program must notify CMS upon its voluntary inactivation as required by § 482.74(a)(3) of this chapter.

        (e) —(1)  Except for situations of immediate jeopardy or deficiencies other than failure to meet requirements at § 482.80 of this chapter, CMS will consider such mitigating factors as may be appropriate in light of the nature of the deficiency and circumstances, including (but not limited to) the following, in making a decision of initial approval of a transplant program that does not meet the data submission, clinical experience, or outcome requirements:

        (i) The extent to which outcome measures are not met or exceeded;

        (ii) Availability of Medicare-approved transplant centers in the area;

        (iii) Extenuating circumstances (for example, natural disaster) that have a temporary effect on meeting the conditions of participation;

        (iv) Program improvements that substantially address root causes of graft failures or patient deaths, that have been implemented and institutionalized on a sustainable basis, and that are supported by outcomes more recent than the latest available SRTR report, for which there is a sufficient post-transplant patient and graft survival period and a sufficient number of transplants such that CMS finds that the program demonstrates present-day compliance with the requirements at § 482.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) of this chapter;

        (v) Whether the program has made extensive use of innovative transplantation practices relative to other transplant programs, such as a high rate of transplantation of individuals who are highly sensitized or children who have undergone a Fontan procedure compared to most other transplant programs, where CMS finds that the innovative practices are supported by evidence-based published research literature or nationally recognized standards or Institution Review Board (IRB) approvals, and the SRTR risk-adjustment methodology does not take the relevant key factors into consideration; and

        (vi) Whether the program's performance, based on the OPTN method of calculating patient and graft survival, is within the OPTN's thresholds for acceptable performance and does not flag OPTN performance review under the applicable OPTN policy.

        (2)  A request for consideration of mitigating factors must include sufficient information to permit an adequate review and understanding of the transplant program, the factors that have contributed to outcomes, program improvements or innovations that have been implemented or planned, and in the case of natural disasters, the recovery actions planned. Examples of information to be submitted with each request include (but are not limited to) the following:

        (i) The name and contact information for the transplant hospital and the names and roles of key personnel of the transplant program;

        (ii) The type of organ transplant program(s) for which approval is requested;

        (iii) The conditions of participation that the program does not meet for which the transplant center is requesting CMS' review for mitigating factors;

        (iv) The program's organizational chart with full-time equivalent levels, roles, and structure for reporting to hospital leadership;

        (v) For applications involving substandard patient or graft survival, the rationale and supporting evidence for CMS' review includes, but is not limited to—

        (A) Root Cause Analysis for patient deaths and graft failures, including factors the program has identified as likely causal or contributing factors for patient deaths and graft failures;

        (B) Program improvements that have been implemented and improvements that are planned;

        (C) Patient and donor/organ selection criteria and evaluation protocols, including methods for pre-transplant patient evaluation by cardiologists, hematologists, nephrologists, and psychiatrists or psychologists to the extent applicable;

        (D) Waitlist management protocols and practices relevant to outcomes;

        (E) Pre-operative management protocols and practices;

        (F) Immunosuppression/infection prophylaxis protocols;

        (G) Post-transplant monitoring and management protocols and practices;

        (H) Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program meeting minutes from the most recent four meetings and attendance rosters from the most recent 12 months;

        (I) Quality dashboard and other performance indicators; and

        (J) The most recent data regarding transplants that have been made and for outcomes in terms of both patient survival and graft survival;

        (vi) For mitigating factors requests based on innovative practice:

        (A) A description of the innovations that have been implemented and identification of the specific cases for which the innovative practices are relevant so as to enable the patient and graft survival data for such cases to be compared with all other transplants for at least the period covered by the latest available SRTR report.

        (B) The literature, research, or other evidentiary basis that supports consideration of the practice(s) as innovative.

        (vii) For requests based on natural disasters or public health emergency:

        (A) A description of the disaster or emergency, the specific impact on the program, the time periods of the event(s) and of its immediate recovery aftermath;

        (B) Identification of the transplants that occurred during the period for which the request is being made; and

        (C) The approximate date when the program believes it substantially recovered from the event(s), or believes it will recover if substantial recovery has not been accomplished at the time of the request.

        (3)  Within 14 calendar days after CMS has issued formal written notice of a condition-level deficiency to the program, CMS must receive notification of the program's intent to seek mitigating factors approval, and receive all information for consideration of mitigating factors within 120 calendar days of the CMS written notification for a deficiency due to data submission, clinical experience or outcomes at § 482.80 of this chapter. Failure to meet these timeframes may be the basis for denial of mitigating factors. CMS may permit an extension of the timeline for good cause, such as a declared public health emergency.

        (f) —(1)  Upon review of the request to consider mitigating factors, CMS may take the following actions:

        (i) Approve initial approval of a program's Medicare participation based upon approval of mitigating factors.

        (ii) Deny the program's request for Medicare approval based on mitigating factors.

        (iii) Offer a time-limited Systems Improvement Agreement, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, when a transplant program has waived its appeal rights, has implemented substantial program improvements that address root causes and are institutionally supported by the hospital's governing body on a sustainable basis, and has requested more time to design or implement additional improvements or demonstrate compliance with CMS outcome requirements. Upon completion of the Systems Improvement Agreement or a CMS finding that the hospital has failed to meet the terms of the Agreement, CMS makes a final determination of whether to approve or deny a program's request for Medicare approval based on mitigating factors. A Systems Improvement Agreement follows the process specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (2)  CMS will not approve any program with a condition-level deficiency. However, CMS may approve a program with a standard-level deficiency upon receipt of an acceptable plan of correction.

        (g)  A Systems Improvement Agreement is a binding agreement, entered into voluntarily by the hospital and CMS, through which CMS extends a prospective Medicare termination date and offers the program additional time to achieve compliance with the conditions of participation, contingent on the hospital's agreement to participate in a structured regimen of quality improvement activities, demonstrate improved outcomes, and waive the right to appeal termination based on the identified deficiency or deficiencies (that led to the Agreement) in consideration for more time to demonstrate compliance. In some cases, transplant programs may enter a period of inactivity—voluntarily, or imposed as a condition of the Systems Improvement Agreement.

        (1)  In exchange for the additional time to initiate or continue activities to achieve compliance with the conditions of participation, the hospital must agree to a regimen of specified activities, including (but not limited to) all of the following:

        (i) Patient notification about the degree and type of noncompliance by the program, an explanation of what the program improvement efforts mean for patients, and financial assistance to defray the out-of-pocket costs of copayments and testing expenses for any wait-listed individual who wishes to be listed with another program;

        (ii) An external independent peer review team that conducts an onsite assessment of the program. The peer review must include—

        (A) Review of policies, staffing, operations, relationship to hospital services, and factors that contribute to program outcomes;

        (B) Suggestions for quality improvements the hospital should consider;

        (C) Both verbal and written feedback provided directly to the hospital;

        (D) Verbal debriefing provided directly to CMS; neither the hospital nor the peer review team is required to provide a written report to CMS; and

        (E) Onsite review by a multidisciplinary team that includes a transplant surgeon with expertise in the relevant organ type(s), a transplant administrator, an individual with expertise in transplant QAPI systems, a social worker or psychologist or psychiatrist, and a specialty physician with expertise in conditions particularly relevant to the applicable organ types(s) such as a cardiologist, nephrologist, or hepatologist. Except for the transplant surgeon, CMS may permit substitution of one type of expertise for another individual who has expertise particularly needed for the type of challenges experienced by the program, such as substitution of an infection control specialist in lieu of, or in addition to, a social worker;

        (iii) An action plan that addresses systemic quality improvements and is updated after the onsite peer review;

        (iv) An onsite consultant whose qualifications are approved by CMS, and who provides services for 8 days per month on average for the duration of the agreement, except that CMS may permit a portion of the time to be spent offsite and may agree to fewer consultant days each month after the first 3 months of the Systems Improvement Agreement;

        (v) A comparative effectiveness analysis that compares policies, procedures, and protocols of the transplant program with those of other programs in areas of endeavor that are relevant to the center's current quality improvement needs;

        (vi) Development of increased proficiency, or demonstration of current proficiency, with patient-level data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the use of registry data to analyze outcomes and inform quality improvement efforts;

        (vii) A staffing analysis that examines the level, type, training, and skill of staff in order to inform transplant center efforts to ensure the engagement and appropriate training and credentialing of staff;

        (viii) Activities to strengthen performance of the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program to ensure full compliance with the requirements of § 482.96 and § 482.21 of this chapter;

        (ix) Monthly (unless otherwise specified) reporting and conference calls with CMS regarding the status of programmatic improvements, results of the deliverables in the Systems Improvement Agreement, and the number of transplants, deaths, and graft failures that occur within 1 year post-transplant; and

        (x) Additional or alternative requirements specified by CMS, tailored to the transplant program type and circumstances. CMS may waive the content elements at paragraph (g)(1)(v), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of this section if it finds that the program has already adequately conducted the activity, the program is already proficient in the function, or the activity is clearly inapplicable to the deficiencies that led to the Agreement.

        (2)  A Systems Improvement Agreement will be established for up to a 12-month period, subject to CMS' discretion to determine if a shorter timeframe may suffice. At the hospital's request, CMS may extend the agreement for up to an additional 6-month period. A signed Systems Improvement Agreement remains in force even if a subsequent SRTR report indicates that the program has restored compliance with the CMS conditions of participation, except that CMS in its sole discretion may shorten the timeframe or allow modification to any portion of the elements of the Agreement in such a case.

        § 488.64   Remote facility variances for utilization review requirements.

#### § § 488.64

        (a) As used in this section:

        (1) An “available” individual is one who:

        (i) Possesses the necessary professional qualifications;

        (ii) Is not precluded from participating by reason of financial interest in any such facility or direct responsibility for the care of the patients being reviewed or, in the case of a skilled nursing facility, employment by the facility; and

        (iii) Is not precluded from effective participation by the distance between the facility and his residence, office, or other place of work. An individual whose residence, office, or other place of work is more than approximately one hour's travel time from the facility shall be considered precluded from effective participation.

        (2) “Adjacent facility” means a health care facility located within a 50-mile radius of the facility which requests a variance.

        (b) The Secretary may grant a requesting facility a variance from the time frames set forth in §§ 405.1137(d) of this chapter and 482.30 as applicable, within which reviews all of cases must be commenced and completed, upon a showing satisfactory to the Secretary that the requesting facility has been unable to meet one or more of the requirements of § 405.1137 of this chapter or § 482.30 of this chapter, as applicable, by reason of insufficient medical and other professional personnel available to conduct the utilization review required by § 405.1137 of this chapter or § 482.30 of this chapter, as applicable.

        (c) The request for variance shall document the requesting facility's inability to meet the requirements for which a variance is requested and the facility's good faith efforts to comply with the requirements contained in § 405.1137 of this chapter or § 482.30 of this chapter, as applicable.

        (d) The request shall include an assurance by the requesting facility that it will continue its good faith efforts to meet the requirements contained in § 405.1137 of this chapter or § 482.30 of this chapter, as applicable.

        (e) A revised utilization review plan for the requesting facility shall be submitted concurrently with the request for a variance. The revised plan shall specify the methods and procedures which the requesting facility will use, if a variance is granted, to assure:

        (1) That effective and timely control will be maintained over the utilization of services; and

        (2) That reviews will be conducted so as to improve the quality of care provided to patients.

        (f) The request for a variance shall include:

        (1) The name, location, and type (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility) of the facility for which the variance is requested;

        (2) The total number of patient admissions and average daily patient census at the facility within the previous six months;

        (3) The total number of title XVIII and title XIX patient admissions and the average daily patient census of title XVIII and title XIX patients in the facility within the previous six months;

        (4) As relevant to the request, the names of all physicians on the active staff of the facility and the names of all other professional personnel on the staff of the facility, or both;

        (5) The name, location, and type of each adjacent facility (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility);

        (6) The distance and average travel time between the facility and each adjacent facility;

        (7) As relevant to the request, the location of practice of available physicians and the estimated number of other available professional personnel, or both (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section);

        (8) Documentation by the facility of its attempt to obtain the services of available physicians or other professional personnel, or both; and

        (9) A statement of whether a QIO exists in the area where the facility is located.

        (g) The Secretary shall promptly notify the facility of the action taken on the request. Where a variance is in effect, the validation of utilization review pursuant to § 405.1137 of this chapter or § 482.30 shall be made with reference to the revised utilization review plan submitted with the request for variance.

        (h) The Secretary, in granting a variance, will specify the period for which the variance has been granted; such period will not exceed one year. A request for a renewal shall be submitted not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the variance and shall contain all information required by paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section. Renewal of the variance will be contingent upon the facility's continuing to meet the provisions of this section.

      Subpart C—Survey Forms and Procedures

        § 488.100   Long term care survey forms, Part A.

#### § § 488.100

        § 488.105   Long term care survey forms, Part B.

#### § § 488.105

        § 488.110   Procedural guidelines.

#### § § 488.110

        The purpose for implementing a new SNF/ICF survey process is to assess whether the quality of care, as intended by the law and regulations, and as needed by the resident, is actually being provided in nursing homes. Although the onsite review procedures have been changed, facilities must continue to meet all applicable Conditions/Standards, in order to participate in Medicare/Medicaid programs. That is, the methods used to compile information about compliance with law and regulations are changed; the law and regulations themselves are not changed. The new process differs from the traditional process, principally in terms of its emphasis on resident outcomes. In ascertaining whether residents grooming and personal hygiene needs are met, for example, surveyors will no longer routinely evaluate a facility's written policies and procedures. Instead, surveyors will observe residents in order to make that determination. In addition, surveyors will confirm, through interviews with residents and staff, that such needs are indeed met on a regular basis. In most reviews, then, surveyors will ascertain whether the facility is actually providing the required and needed care and services, rather than whether the facility is capable of providing the care and services.

        (a)  A complete SNF/ICF facility survey consists of three components:

        • Life Safety Code requirements;

        • Administrative and structural requirements (Part A of the Survey Report, Form CMS-525); and

        • Direct resident care requirements (Part B of the Survey Report, Form CMS-519), along with the related worksheets (CMS-520 through 524).

        Use this survey process for all surveys of SNFs and ICFs—whether freestanding, distinct parts, or dually certified. Do not use this process for surveys of Intermediate Care Facilities for Mentally Retarded (ICFs/IID), swing-bed hospitals or skilled nursing sections of hospitals that are not separately certified as SNF distinct parts. Do not announce SNF/ICF surveys ahead of time.

        (b)  Listed below are the survey tasks for easy reference:

        • Task 1. Entrance Conference.

        • Task 2. Resident Sample—Selection Methodology.

        • Task 3. Tour of the Facility. Resident Needs. Physical Environment. Meeting with Resident Council Representatives. Tour Summation and Focus of Remaining Survey Activity.

        • Task 4. Observation/Interview/Medical Record. Review of Each Individual in the Resident Sample (including drug regimen review).

        • Task 5. Drug Pass Observation.

        • Task 6. Dining Area and Eating Assistance Observation.

        • Task 7. Forming the Deficiency Statement (if necessary).

        • Task 8. Exit Conference.

        (c) — Perform these activities during the entrance conference in every certification and recertification survey:

        • Introduce all members of the team to the facility staff, if possible, even though the whole team may not be present for the entire entrance conference. (All surveyors wear identification tags.)

        • Explain the SNF/ICF survey process as resident centered in focus, and outline the basic steps.

        • Ask the facility for a list showing names of residents by room number with each of the following care needs/treatments identified for each resident to whom they apply:

        Use this list for selecting the resident sample.

        • Ask the facility to complete page 2 of Form CMS-519 (Resident Census) as soon as possible, so that the information can further orient you to the facility's population. In a survey of a SNF with a distinct part ICF, you may collect two sets of census data. However, consolidate the information when submitting it to the regional office. You may modify the Resident Census Form to include the numbers of licensed and certified beds, if necessary.

        • Ask the facility to post signs on readily viewed areas (at least one on each floor) announcing that State surveyors are in the facility performing an “inspection,” and are available to meet with residents in private. Also indicate the name and telephone number of the State agency. Hand-printed signs with legible, large letters are acceptable.

        • If the facility has a Resident Council, make mutually agreeable arrangements to meet privately with the president and officers and other individuals they might invite.

        • Inform the facility that interviews with residents and Resident Councils are conducted privately, unless they independently request otherwise, in order to enhance the development of rapport as well as to allay any resident anxiety. Tell the facility that information is gathered from interviews, the tour, observations, discussions, record review, and facility officials. Point out that the facility will be given an opportunity to respond to all findings.

        (d) —— This methodology is aimed at formulating a sample that reflects the actual distribution of care needs/treatments in the facility population.

        Primarily performed on a random basis, it also ensures representation in the sample of certain care needs and treatments that are assessed during the survey.

        (1)  Calculate the size of the sample according to the following guide:

        Note that the calculation is based on the resident census, not beds. After determining the appropriate sample size, select residents for the sample in a random manner. You may, for example, select every fifth resident from the resident census, beginning at a random position on the list. For surveys of dually certified facilities or distinct part SNFs/ICFs, first use the combined SNF/ICF population to calculate the size of the sample, and then select a sample that reflects the proportions of SNF and ICF residents in the facility's overall population.

        (2)  The survey form specifies several care needs/treatments that must always be reviewed when they apply to any facility residents. These include:

        Due to the relatively low prevalence of these care needs/treatments, appropriate residents may be either under-

        Review no less than 25 percent of the residents in each of these special care needs/treatments categories. For example, if the facility has 10 residents with decubitus ulcers, but only one of these residents is selected randomly, review two more residents with decubitis ulcers (25% of 10 equals 2.5, so review a total of 3). Or, if the facility has two residents who require tube feeding, neither of whom is in the random selection, review the care of at least one of the these residents. This can be accomplished in the following manner:

        Conduct in-depth reviews of the randomly selected residents and then perform limited reviews of additional residents as needed to cover the specified care categories. Such reviews are limited to the care and services related to the pertinent care areas only, e.g., catheters, restraints, or colostomy. Utilize those worksheets or portions of worksheets which are appropriate to the limited review. Refer to the Care Guidelines, as a resource document, when appropriate.

        Always keep in mind that neither the random selection approach nor the review of residents within the specified care categories precludes investigation of other resident care situations that you believe might pose a serious threat to a resident's health or safety. Add to the sample, as appropriate.

        (e) ——(1)  Conduct the tour in order to:

        • Develop an overall picture of the types and patterns of care delivery present within the facility;

        • View the physical environment; and

        • Ascertain whether randomly selected residents are communicative and willing to be interviewed.

        (2)  You may tour the entire facility as a team or separately, as long as all areas of the facility are examined by at least one team member. Success of the latter approach, however, is largely dependent on open intra-team communication and the ability of each team member to identify situations for further review by the team member of the appropriate discipline. You may conduct the tour with or without facility staff accompanying you, as you prefer. Facilities, however, vary in staff member availability. Record your notes on the Tour Notes Worksheet, Form CMS-521.

        Allow approximately three hours for the tour. Converse with residents, family members/significant others (if present), and staff, asking open-ended questions in order to confirm observations, obtain additional information, or corroborate information, (e.g., accidents, odors, apparent inappropriate dress, adequacy and appropriateness of activities). Converse sufficiently with residents selected for in-depth review to ascertain whether they are willing to be interviewed and are communicative. Observe staff interactions with other staff members as well as with residents for insight into matters such as resident rights and assignments of staff responsibilities.

        Always knock and/or get permission before entering a room or interrupting privacy. If you wish to inspect a resident's skin, observe a treatment procedure, or observe a resident who is exposed, courteously ask permission from the resident if she/he comprehends, or ask permission from the staff nurse if the resident cannot communicate. Do not do “hands-on” monitoring such as removal of dressings; ask staff to remove a dressing or handle a resident.

        (3)  While touring, focus on the residents' needs—physical, emotional, psychosocial, or spiritual—and whether those needs are being met. Refer to the following list as needed:

        (4)  As you tour each resident's room and auxiliary rooms, also examine them in connection with the physical environment requirements. You need not document physical environment on the Tour Notes Worksheet. Instead, you may note any negative findings directly on the Survey Report Form in the remarks section.

        (5)  If a facility has a Resident Council, one or more surveyors meet with the respresentatives in a private area. Facility staff members do not attend unless specifically requested by the Council. Explain the purpose of the survey and briefly outline the steps in the survey process, i.e., entrance conference * * * exit conference. Indicate your interest in learning about the strengths of the facility in addition to any complaints or shortcomings. State that this meeting is one part of the information gathering; the findings have not yet been completed nor the conclusions formulated. Explain further, however, that the official survey findings are usually available within three months after the completion of the survey, and give the telephone number of the State agency office.

        Use this meeting to ascertain strengths and/or problems, if any, from the consumer's perspective, as well as to develop additional information about aspects of care and services gleaned during the tour that were possibly substandard.

        Conduct the meeting in a manner that allows for comments about any aspect of the facility. (See the section on Interview Procedures.) Use open-ended questions such as:

        • “What is best about this home?”

        • “What is worst?”

        • “What would you like to change?”

        In order to get more detail, use questions such as:

        • “Can you be more specific?”

        • “Can you give me an example?”

        • “What can anyone else tell me about this?”

        If you wish to obtain information about a topic not raised by the residents, use an approach like the following:

        • “Tell me what you think about the food/staff/cleanliness here.”

        • “What would make it better?”

        • “What don't you like? What do you like?”

        (6)  When the tour is completed, review the resident census data provided by the facility. Determine if the care categories specified in the section on Resident Sample are sufficiently represented in the random selection, make adjustments as needed, and complete the listing of residents on the worksheet labeled “Residents Selected for In-depth Review”, Form CMS-520.

        Transcribe notes of a negative nature onto the SRF in the “Remarks” column under the appropriate rule. Findings from a later segment in the survey or gathered by another surveyor may combine to substantiate a deficiency. You need not check “met” or “not met” at this point in the survey. Discuss significant impressions/conclusions at the completion of each subsequent survey task, and transfer any negative findings onto the Survey Report Form in the Remarks section.

        (f) — Perform the in-depth review of each individual in the resident sample in order to ascertain whether the facility is meeting resident needs. Evaluate specific indicators for each resident, utilizing the front and back of the “Observation/Interview/Record Review (OIRR)” worksheet, Form CMS-524. You may prefer to perform the record review first, complete resident/staff/family observations and interviews, and finally, return to the record for any final unresolved issues. On the other hand, you may prefer to do the interviews first. Either method is acceptable. Whenever possible, however, complete one resident's observation/interview/medical record review and document the OIRR before moving onto another resident. If because of the facility layout, it is more efficient to do more than one record review at a time, limit such record review to two or three residents so your familiarity with the particular resident and continuity of the OIRR are not compromised.

        (1)  Conduct observations concurrently with interviews of residents, family/significant others, and discussions with direct care staff [of the various disciplines involved. In multi-facility operations, whenever possible, observe staff that is regularly assigned to the facility in order to gain an understanding of the care and services usually provided.] Maintain respect for resident privacy. Minimize disruption of the operations of the facility or impositions upon any resident as much as possible. Based upon your observations of the residents' needs, gather information about any of the following areas, as appropriate:

        (2)  Interview each resident in private unless he/she independently requests that a facility staff member or other individual be present. Conduct the in-depth interview in a nonthreatening and noninvasive fashion so as to decrease anxiety and defensiveness. The open-ended approach described in the section on the Resident Council is also appropriate for the in-depth interview. While prolonged time expenditure is not usually a worthwhile use of resources or the resident's time, do allow time initially to establish rapport.

        At each interview:

        • Introduce yourself.

        • Address the resident by name.

        • Explain in simple terms the reason for your visit (e.g., to assure that the care and services are adequate and appropriate for each resident).

        • Briefly outline the process—entrance conference, tour, interviews, observations, review of medical records, resident interviews, and exit conference.

        • Mention that the selection of a particular resident for an interview is not meant to imply that his/her care is substandard or that the facility provides substandard care. Also mention that most of those interviewed are selected randomly.

        • Assure that you will strive for anonymity for the resident and that the interview is used in addition to medical records, observations, discussions, etc., to capture an accurate picture of the treatment and care provided by the facility. Explain that the official findings of the survey are usually available to the public about three months after completion of the survey, but resident names are not given to the public.

        • When residents experience difficulty expressing themselves:

        • When interviewing residents with decreased receptive capacity:

        The length of the interview varies, depending on the condition and wishes of the resident and the amount of information supplied. Expect the average interview, however, to last approximately 15 minutes. Courteously terminate an interview whenever the resident is unable or unwilling to continue, or is too confused or disoriented to continue. Do, however, perform the other activities of this task (observation and record review). If, in spite of your conversing during the tour, you find that less than 40 percent of the residents in your sample are sufficiently alert and willing to be interviewed, try to select replacements so that a complete OIRR is performed for a group this size, if possible. There may be situations, however, where the resident population has a high percentage of confused individuals and this percentage is not achievable. Expect that the information from confused individuals can be, but is not necessarily, less reliable than that from more alert individuals.

        Include the following areas in the interview of each resident in the sample:

        Refer to the Care Guidelines “evaluation factors” as a resource for possible elements to consider when focusing on particular aspects of care and resident needs.

        Document information obtained from the interviews/observations on the OIRR Worksheet. Record in the “Notes” section any additional information you may need in connection with substandard care or services. Unless the resident specifically requests that he/she be identified, do not reveal the source of the information gleaned from the interview.

        (3)  The medical record review is a three-part process, which involves first reconciling the observation/interview findings with the record, then reconciling the record against itself, and lastly performing the drug regimen review.

        Document your findings on the OIRR Worksheet, as appropriate, and summarize on the Survey Report Form the findings that are indicative of problematic or substandard care. Be alert for repeated similar instances of substandard care developing as the number of completed OIRR Worksheets increases.

        (i)  Determine if:

        • An assessment has been performed.

        • A plan with goals has been developed.

        • The interventions have been carried out.

        • The resident has been evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the interventions.

        For example, if a resident has developed a decubitus ulcer while in the facility, record review can validate staff and resident interviews regarding the facility's attempts at prevention. Use your own judgment; review as much of the record(s) as necessary to evaluate the care planning. Note that facilities need not establish specific areas in the record stating “Assessment,” “Plan,” “Intervention,” or “Evaluation” in order for the documentation to be considered adequate.

        (ii)  Determine:

        • If the resident has been properly assessed for all his/her needs.

        • That normal and routine nursing practices such as periodic weights, temperatures, blood pressures, etc., are performed as required by the resident's conditions.

        (iii)  The purpose of the drug regimen review is to determine if the pharmacist has reviewed the drug regimen on a monthly basis. Follow the procedures in Part One of Appendix N, Surveyor Procedures for Pharmaceutical Service Requirements in Long-Term Care Facilities. Fill in the appropriate boxes on the top left hand corner of the reverse side of the OIRR Worksheet, Form CMS-524. Appendix N lists many irregularities that can occur. Review at least six different indicators on each survey. However, the same six indicators need not be reviewed on every survey.

        (g)  The purpose of the drug pass observation is to observe the actual preparation and administration of medications to residents. With this approach, there is no doubt that the errors detected, if any, are errors in drug administration, not documentation. Follow the procedure in Part Two of Appendix N, Surveyor Procedures for Pharmaceutical Service Requirements in Long-Term Care Facilities, and complete the Drug Pass Worksheet, Form CMS-522. Be as neutral and unobtrusive as possible during the drug pass observation. Whenever possible, select one surveyor, who is a Registered Nurse or a pharmacist, to observe the drug pass of approximately 20 residents. In facilities where fewer than 20 residents are receiving medications, review as many residents receiving medications as possible. Residents selected for the in-depth review need not be included in the group chosen for the drug pass; however, their whole or partial inclusion is acceptable. In order to get a balanced view of a facility's practices, observe more than one person administering a drug pass, if feasible. This might involve observing the morning pass one day in Wing A, for example, and the morning pass the next day in Wing B.

        Transfer findings noted on the “Drug Pass” worksheet to the SRF under the appropriate rule. If your team concludes that the facility's medication error rate is 5 percent or more, cite the deficiency under Nursing Services/Administration of Drugs. Report the error rate under F209. If the deficiency is at the standard level, cite it in Nursing Services, rather than Pharmacy.

        (h)  The purpose of this task is to ascertain the extent to which the facility meets dietary needs, particularly for those who require eating assistance. This task also yields information about staff interaction with residents, promptness and appropriateness of assistance, adaptive equipment usage and availability, as well as appropriateness of dress and hygiene for meals.

        For this task, use the worksheet entitled “Dining Area and Eating Assistance Observation” (Form CMS-523). Observe two meals; for a balanced view, try to observe meals at different times of the day. For example, try to observe a breakfast and a dinner rather than two breakfasts. Give particular care to performing observations as unobtrusively as possible. Chatting with residents and sitting down nearby may help alleviate resident anxiety over the observation process.

        Select a minimum of five residents for each meal observation and include residents who have their meals in their rooms. Residents selected for the in-depth review need not be included in the dining and eating assistance observation; however, their whole or partial inclusion is acceptable. Ascertain the extent to which the facility assesses, plans, and evaluates the nutritional care of residents and eating assistance needs by reviewing the sample of 10 or more residents. If you are unable to determine whether the facility meets the standards from the sample reviewed, expand the sample and focus on the specific area(s) in question, until you can formulate a conclusion about the extent of compliance. As with the other survey tasks, transfer the findings noted on the “Dining & Eating Assistance Observation” worksheet to the Survey Report Form.

        (i) —(1)  The Survey Report Form contains information about all of the negative findings of the survey. Be sure to transfer to the Survey Report Form data from the tour, drug pass observation, dining area and eating assistance observation, as well as in-depth review of the sample of residents. Transfer only those findings which could possibly contribute to a determination that the facility is deficient in a certain area.

        Meet as a group in a pre-exit conference to discuss the findings and make conclusions about the deficiencies, subject to information provided by facility officials that may further explain the situation. Review the summaries/conclusions from each task and decide whether any further information and/or documentation is necessary to substantiate a deficiency. As the facility for additional information for clarification about particular findings, if necessary. Always consider information provided by the facility. If the facility considers as acceptable, practices which you believe are not acceptable, ask the facility to backup its contention with suitable reference material or sources and submit them for your consideration.

        (2)  Analyze the findings on the Survey Report Form for the degree of severity, frequency of occurrence and impact on delivery of care or quality of life. The threshold at which the frequency of occurrences amounts to a deficiency varies from situation to situation. One occurrence directly related to a life-threatening or fatal outcome can be cited as a deficiency. On the other hand, a few sporadic occurrences may have so slight an impact on delivery of care or quality of life that they do not warrant a deficiency citation. Review carefully all the information gathered. What may appear during observation as a pattern, may or may not be corroborated by records, staff, and residents. For example, six of the 32 residents in the sample are dressed in mismatched, poorly buttoned clothes. A few of the six are wearing slippers without socks. A few others are wearing worn clothes. Six occurrences might well be indicative of a pattern of susbstandard care. Close scrutiny of records, discussions with staff, and interviews reveal, however, that the six residents are participating in dressing retraining programs. Those residents who are without socks, chose to do so. The worn clothing items were also chosen—they are favorites.

        Combinations of substandard care such as poor grooming of a number of residents, lack of ambulation of a number of residents, lack of attention to positioning, poor skin care, etc., can yield a deficiency in nursing services just as 10 out of 10 residents receiving substandard care for decubiti yields a deficiency.

        (3)  If staff or residents allege deficiencies, but records, interviews, and observation fail to confirm the situation, it is unlikely that a deficiency exists. Care and services that are indeed confirmed by the survey to be in compliance with the regulatory requirements, but considered deficient by residents or staff, cannot be cited as deficient for certification purposes. On the other hand, if an allegation is of a very serious nature (e.g., resident abuse) and the tools of record review and observation are not effective because the problem is concealed, obtain as much information as possible or necessary to ascertain compliance, and cite accordingly. Residents, family, or former employees may be helpful for information gathering.

        (4)  Write the deficiency statement in terms specific enough to allow a reasonably knowledgeable person to understand the aspect(s) of the requirement(s) that is (are) not met. Do not delve into the facility's policies and procedures to determine or speculate on the root cause of a deficiency, or sift through various alternatives in an effort to prescribe an acceptable remedy. Indicate the data prefix tag and regulatory citation, followed by a summary of the deficiency and supporting findings using resident identifiers, not resident names, as in the following example.

        When the data prefix tag does not repeat the regulations, also include a short phrase that describes the prefix tag (e.g., F117 decubitus ulcer care). List the data tags in numerical order, whenever possible.

        (j)  The purpose of the exit conference is to inform the facility of survey findings and to arrange for a plan of correction, if needed. Keep the tone of the exit conference consistent with the character of the survey process—inspection and enforcement. Tactful, business-like, professional presentation of the findings is of paramount importance. Recognize that the facility may wish to respond to various findings. Although deficiency statements continue to depend, in part, on surveyor professional judgment, support your conclusions with resident-specific examples (identifiers other than names) whenever you can do so without compromising confidentiality. Before formally citing deficiencies, discuss any allegations or findings that could not be substantiated during earlier tasks in the process. For example, if information is gathered that suggests a newly hired R.N. is not currently licensed, ask the facility officials to present current licensure information for the nurse in question. Identify residents when the substandard care is readily observed or discerned through record review. Ensure that the facility improves the care provided to all affected residents, not only the identified residents. Make clear to the facility that during a follow-up visit the surveyors may review residents other than those with significant problems from the original sample, in order to see that the facility has corrected the problems overall. Do not disclose the source of information provided during interviews, unless the resident has specifically requested you to inform the facility of his/her comments or complaints. In accordance with your Agency's policy, present the Statement of Deficiencies, form CMS-2567, on site or after supervisory review, no later than 10 calendar days following the survey.

        (k)  Explain to the facility that your role is to identify care and services which are not consistent with the regulatory requirements, rather than to ascertain the root causes of deficiencies. Each facility is expected to review its own care delivery. Subsequent to the exit conference, each facility is required to submit a plan of correction that identifies necessary changes in operation that will assure correction of the cited deficiencies. In reviewing and accepting a proposed plan of correction, apply these criteria:

        • Does the facility have a reasonable approach for correcting the deficiencies?

        • Is there a high probability that the planned action will result in compliance?

        • Is compliance expected timely?

        Plans of correction specific to residents identified on the deficiency statement are acceptable only where the deficiency is determined to be unique to that resident and not indicative of a possible systemic problem. For example, as a result of an aide being absent, two residents are not ambulated three times that day as called for in their care plans. A plan of correction that says “Ambulate John Jones and Mary Smith three times per day,” is not acceptable. An acceptable plan of correction would explain changes made to the facility's staffing and scheduling in order to gurantee that staff is available to provide all necessary services for all residents.

        Acceptance of the plan of correction does not absolve the facility of the responsibility for compliance should the implementation not result in correction and compliance. Acceptance indicates the State agency's acknowledgement that the facility indicated a willingness and ability to make corrections adequately and timely.

        Allow the facility up to 10 days to prepare and submit the plan of correction to the State agency, however, follow your SA policy if the timeframe is shorter. Retain the various survey worksheets as well as the Survey Report Form at the State agency. Forward the deficiency statement to the CMS regional office.

        (l)  The purpose of the follow-up survey is to re-evaluate the specific types of care or care delivery patterns that were cited as deficient during the original survey. Ascertain the corrective status of all deficiencies cited on the CMS-2567. Because this survey process focuses on the actual provision of care and services, revisits are almost always necessary to ascertain whether the deficienicies have indeed been corrected. The nature of the deficiencies dictates the scope of the follow-up visit. Use as many tasks or portions of the Survey Report Form(s) as needed to ascertain compliance status. For example, you need not perform another drug pass if no drug related deficiencies were cited on the initial survey. Similarly, you need not repeat the dining area and eating assistance observations if no related problems were identified. All or some of the aspects of the observation/interview/medical record review, however, are likely to be appropriate for the follow-up survey.

        When selecting the resident sample for the follow-up, determine the sample size using the same formula as used earlier in the survey, with the following exceptions:

        • The maximum sample size is 30 residents, rather than 50.

        • The minimum sample size of 10 residents does not apply if only one care category was cited as deficient and the total number of residents in the facility in that category was less than 10 (e.g., deficiency cited under catheter care and only five residents have catheters).

        Include in the sample those residents who, in your judgment, are appropriate for reviewing vis-a-vis the cited substandard care. If possible, include some residents identified as receiving substandard care during the initial survey. If after completing the follow-up activities you determine that the cited deficiencies were not corrected, initiate adverse action procedures, as appropriate.

        (m)  The survey and certification process is intended to determine whether providers and suppliers meet program participation requirements. The primary role of the surveyor, then, is to assess the quality of care and services and to relate those findings to statutory and regulatory requirements for program participation.

        When you find substandard care or services in the course of a survey, carefully document your findings. Explain the deficiency in sufficient detail so that the facility officials understand your rationale. If the cause of the deficiency is obvious, share the information with the provider. For example, if you cite a deficiency for restraints (F118), indicate that restraints were applied backwards on residents 1621, 1634, 1646, etc.

        In those instances where the cause is not obvious, do not delve into the facility's policies and procedures to determine the root cause of any deficiency. Do not recommend or prescribe an acceptable remedy. The provider is responsible for deciding on and implementing the action(s) necessary for achieving compliance. For the restraint situation in the example above, you would not ascertain whether the improper application was due to improper training or lack of training, nor would you attempt to identify the staff member who applied the restraints. It is the provider's responsibility to make the necessary changes or corrections to ensure that the restriants are applied properly.

        A secondary role for the surveyor is to provide general consultation to the provider/consumer community. This includes meeting with provider/consumer associations and other groups as well as participating in seminars. It also includes informational activities, whereby you respond to oral or written inquiries about required outcomes in care and services.

        (n)  Conduct the survey in a manner that allows for the greatest degree of confidentiality for residents, particularly regarding the information gathered during the in-depth interviews. When recording observations about care and resident conditions, protect the privacy of all residents. Use a code such as resident identifier number rather than names on worksheets whenever possible. Never use a resident's name on the Deficiency Statement, Form CMS-2567. Block out resident names, if any, from any document that is disclosed to the facility, individual or organization.

        When communicating to the facility about substandard care, fully identify the resident(s) by name if the situation was identified through observation or record review. Improperly applied restraints, expired medication, cold food, gloves not worn for a sterile procedure, and diet inconsistent with order, are examples of problems which can be identified to the facility by resident name. Information about injuries due to broken equipment, prolonged use of restraints, and opened mail is less likely to be obtained through observation or record review. Do not reveal the source of information unless actually observed, discovered in the record review, or requested by the resident or family.

        (o)  Whenever possible, use the following survey team model:

        In facilities with 200 beds or less, the team size may range from 2 to 4 members. If the team size is:

        •  The team has at least one RN plus another RN or a dietitian or a pharmacist.

        •  In addition to the composition described above, the team has one or two members of any discipline such as a social worker, sanitarian, etc.

        If the facility has over 200 beds  the survey will last more than 2 days, the team size may be greater than 4 members. Select additional disciplines as appropriate to the facility's compliance history.

        Average onsite time per survey: 60 person hours (Number of surveyors multiplied by the number of hours on site)

        Preferably, team members have gerontological training and experience. Any member may serve as the team leader, consistent with State agency procedures. In followup surveys, select disciplines based on major areas of correction. Include a social worker, for example, if the survey revealed major psychosocial problems. This model does not consider integrated survey and Inspection of Care review teams, which typically would be larger.

        (p) — Apply the regulations to the various types of facilities in the following manner:

        (q) —(1)  Use Part A for initial certification surveys only, except under the following circumstances:

        • When a terminated facility requests program participation 60 days or more after termination. Treat this situation as a request for initial certification and complete Part A of the survey report in addition to Part B.

        • If an ICF with a favorable compliance history requests to covert a number of beds to SNF level, complete both Part A and Part B for compliance with the SNF requirements. If distinct part status is at issue, also examine whether it meets the criteria for certification as a distinct part.

        (i)  Use the Outpatient Physical Therapy—Speech Pathology SRF (CMS-1893) as an addendum to Part A.

        (ii)  Do not use Part A for resurveys of participating SNFs and ICFs. A determination of compliance, based on documented examination of the written policies and procedures and other pertinent documents during the initial survey, establishes the facility's compliance status with Part A requirements. This does not preclude citing deficiencies if they pertain to administrative or structural requirements from Part A that are uncovered incidental to a Part B survey. As an assurance measure, however, each facility at the time of recertification must complete an affidavit (on the CMS-1516) attesting that no substantive changes have occurred that would affect compliance. Each facility must also agree to notify the State agency immediately of any upcoming changes in its organization or management which may affect its compliance status. If a new administrator is unable to complete the affidavit, proceed with the survey using the Part B form and worksheets; do not use the Part A form. The survey cannot be considered complete, however, until the affidavit is signed. If the facility fails to complete the affidavit, it cannot participate in the program.

        (iii)  If you receive such information, review the changes to ensure compliance with the regulations. Request copies of the appropriate documents (e.g., written policies and procedures, personnel qualifications, or agreements) if they were not submitted. If the changes have made continued compliance seem doubtful, determine through a Part B survey whether deficiencies have resulted. Cite any deficiencies on the CMS-2567 and follow the usual procedures.

        (2)  Use Part B and the worksheets for all types of SNF and ICF surveys—initials, recertifications, followup, complaints, etc.

        The worksheets are:

        For complaint investigations, perform a full or partial Part B survey based on the extent of the allegations. If the complaint alleges substandard care in a general fashion or in a variety of services and care areas, perform several tasks or a full Part B survey, as needed. If the complaint is of a more specific nature, such as an allegation of improper medications, perform an appropriate partial Part B survey, such as a drug pass review and a review of selected medical records.

#### § § 488.301

        As used in this subpart—

        means a survey other than a standard survey that gathers information primarily through resident-centered techniques on facility compliance with the requirements for participation. An abbreviated standard survey may be premised on complaints received; a change of ownership, management, or director of nursing; or other indicators of specific concern. _Abbreviated standard survey_s conducted to investigate a complaint or to conduct on-site monitoring to verify compliance with participation requirements are subject to the requirements of § 488.332. Other premises for abbreviated standard surveys would follow the requirements of § 488.314.

        is the willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental anguish. _Abuse_ also includes the deprivation by an individual, including a caretaker, of goods or services that are necessary to attain or maintain physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being. Instances of abuse of all residents, irrespective of any mental or physical condition, cause physical harm, pain or mental anguish. It includes verbal abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and mental abuse including abuse facilitated or enabled through the use of technology.  as used in this definition of abuse, means the individual must have acted deliberately, not that the individual must have intended to inflict injury or harm.

        means a SNF's or NF's failure to meet a participation requirement specified in the Act or in part 483, subpart B of this chapter.

        means a facility that has a provider agreement in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

        means a survey that evaluates additional participation requirements subsequent to finding substandard quality of care during a standard survey.

        means a SNF or NF, or a distinct part SNF or NF, in accordance with § 483.5 of this chapter.

        means husband or wife; natural or adoptive parent, child or sibling; stepparent, stepchild, stepbrother, or stepsister; father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law; grandparent or grandchild.

        means a situation in which the provider's noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident.

        means the deliberate misplacement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary or permanent use of a resident's belongings or money without the resident's consent.

        is the failure of the facility, its employees or service providers to provide goods and services to a resident that are necessary to avoid physical harm, pain, mental anguish, or emotional distress.

        means any deficiency that causes a facility to not be in substantial compliance.

        means an individual, as defined in § 483.5 of this chapter.

        means a Medicaid nursing facility.

        means an individual who meets the requirements specified in § 483.60(h)(1) of this chapter and who is paid to feed residents by a facility, or who is used under an arrangement with another agency or organization.

        means a survey that evaluates additional participation requirements subsequent to finding substandard quality of care during an abbreviated standard survey.

        means a Medicare nursing facility.

        means a periodic, resident-centered inspection which gathers information about the quality of service furnished in a facility to determine compliance with the requirements for participation.

        means one or more deficiencies related to participation requirements under § 483.10 “Resident rights”, paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(2), (b)(1) through (b)(2), (e) (except for (e)(2), (e)(7), and (e)(8)), (f)(1) through (f)(3), (f)(5) through (f)(8), and (i) of this chapter; § 483.12 of this chapter “Freedom from abuse, neglect, and exploitation”; § 483.24 of this chapter “Quality of life”; § 483.25 of this chapter “Quality of care”; § 483.40 “Behavioral health services”, paragraphs (b) and (d) of this chapter; § 483.45 “Pharmacy services”, paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this chapter; § 483.70 “Administration”, paragraph (p) of this chapter, and § 483.80 “Infection control”, paragraph (d) of this chapter, which constitute either immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety; a pattern of or widespread actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy; or a widespread potential for more than minimal harm, but less than immediate jeopardy, with no actual harm.

        means a level of compliance with the requirements of participation such that any identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to resident health or safety than the potential for causing minimal harm.

        means a survey conducted by the Secretary within 2 months following a standard survey, abbreviated standard survey, partial extended survey, or extended survey for the purpose of monitoring State survey agency performance.

        (b) A State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities that provide the highest quality care to Medicaid residents. For purposes of section 1903(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, proper expenses incurred by a State in carrying out such a program are considered to be expenses necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.

        (c) A State must conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of NFs in order to present current regulations, procedures, and policies under this subpart and subpart F of this part.

        (d) Required remedies for a non-State operated NF. A State must establish, in addition to termination of the provider agreement, the following remedies or an approved alternative to the following remedies for imposition against a non-State operated NF:

        (1) Temporary management.

        (2) Denial of payment for new admissions.

        (3) Civil money penalties.

        (4) Transfer of residents.

        (5) Closure of the facility and transfer of residents.

        (6) State monitoring.

        (e) Optional remedies for a non-State operated NF. A State may establish the following remedies for imposition against a non-State operated NF:

        (1) Directed plan of correction.

        (2) Directed in-service training.

        (3) Alternative or additional State remedies.

        (f) Alternative or additional State remedies. If a State uses remedies that are in addition to those specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, or alternative to those specified in paragraph (d) of this section (other than termination of participation), it must—

        (1) Specify those remedies in the State plan; and

        (2) Demonstrate to CMS's satisfaction that those alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the remedies listed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

        § 488.305   Standard surveys.

#### § § 488.305

        (a) For each SNF and NF, the State survey agency must conduct standard surveys that include all of the following:

        (1) A case-mix stratified sample of residents;

        (2) A survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment;

        (3) An audit of written plans of care and residents' assessments to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care; and

        (4) A review of compliance with residents' rights requirements set forth in sections 1819(c) and 1919(c) of the Act.

        (b) The State survey agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth in this section will not invalidate otherwise legitimate determinations that a facility's deficiencies exist.

        (1) The numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in the NFs that CMS found to be noncompliant during validation surveys for that quarter; and

        (2) The denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in the NFs in which CMS conducted validation surveys during that quarter.

        (f)  When a State is dissatisfied with CMS's determination to reduce FFP, the State may appeal the determination to the Departmental Appeals Board, using the procedures specified in 45 CFR part 16.

        § 488.330   Certification of compliance or noncompliance.

#### § § 488.330

        (a) —(1)  (i) The State survey agency surveys all facilities for compliance or noncompliance with requirements for long term care facilities. The survey by the State survey agency may be followed by a Federal validation survey.

        (A) The State certifies the compliance or noncompliance of non-State operated NFs. Regardless of the State entity doing the certification, it is final, except in the case of a complaint or validation survey conducted by CMS, or CMS review of the State's findings.

        (B) CMS certifies the compliance or noncompliance of all State-operated facilities.

        (C) The State survey agency certifies the compliance or noncompliance of a non-State operated SNF, subject to the approval of CMS.

        (D) The State survey agency certifies compliance or noncompliance for a dually participating SNF/NF. In the case of a disagreement between CMS and the State survey agency, a finding of noncompliance takes precedence over that of compliance.

        (ii) In the case of a validation survey, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding, and takes precedence over a certification of compliance resulting from the State survey.

        (2)  (i) Certification by the State is based on the survey agency findings.

        (ii) Certification by CMS is based on either the survey agency findings (in the case of State-operated facilities), or, in the case of a validation survey, on CMS's own survey findings.

        (b) —(1)  A certification of compliance constitutes a determination that the facility is in substantial compliance and is eligible to participate in Medicaid as a NF, or in Medicare as a SNF, or in Medicare and Medicaid as a dually participating facility.

        (2)  A certification of noncompliance requires denial of participation for prospective providers and enforcement action for current providers in accordance with subpart F of this part. Enforcement action must include one of the following:

        (i) Termination of any Medicare or Medicaid provider agreements that are in effect.

        (ii) Application of alternative remedies instead of, or in addition to, termination procedures.

        (c)  The notice of certification of noncompliance is sent in accordance with the timeframes specified in § 488.402(f), and resulting action is issued by CMS, except when the State is taking the action for a non-State operated NF.

        (d)  The notice of certification of noncompliance is sent in accordance with the timeframes specified in § 488.402(f) and includes information on all of the following:

        (1) Nature of noncompliance.

        (2) Any alternative remedies to be imposed under subpart F of this part.

        (3) Any termination or denial of participation action to be taken under this part.

        (4) The appeal rights available to the facility under this part.

        (5) Timeframes to be met by the provider and certifying agency with regard to each of the enforcement actions or appeal procedures addressed in the notice.

        (e)  (1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, the State must impose remedies promptly on any provider of services participating in the Medicaid program—

        (i) After promptly notifying the facility of the deficiencies and impending remedy or remedies; and

        (ii) Except for civil money penalties, during any pending hearing that may be requested by the provider of services.

        (2) CMS imposes remedies promptly on any provider of services participating in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any provider of services participating in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs—

        (i) After promptly notifying the facility of the deficiencies and impending remedy or remedies; and

        (ii) Except for civil money penalties imposed on NFs-only by the State, during any pending hearing that may be requested by the provider of services.

        (3) The provisions of part 498 of this chapter apply when the following providers request a hearing on a denial of participation, or certification of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy (including termination of the provider agreement), except State monitoring:

        (i) All State-operated facilities;

        (ii) SNFs and dually participating SNF/NFs; and

        (iii) Any other facilities subject to a CMS validation survey or CMS review of the State's findings.

        (4) The provisions of part 431 of this chapter apply when a non-State operated Medicaid NF, which has not received a CMS validation survey or CMS review of the State's findings, requests a hearing on the State's denial of participation, termination of provider agreement, or certification of noncompliance leading to an alternative remedy, except State monitoring.

        (f)  CMS or the Medicaid agency may execute a provider agreement when a prospective provider is in substantial compliance with all the requirements for participation for a SNF or NF, respectively.

        (g)  (1) CMS may make independent certifications of a NF's, SNF's, or dually participating facility's noncompliance based on a CMS validation survey.

        (2) CMS issues the notice of actions affecting facilities for which CMS did validation surveys.

        (3) For non-State-operated NFs and non-State-operated dually participating facilities, any disagreement between CMS and the State regarding the timing and choice of remedies is resolved in accordance with § 488.452.

        (4) Either CMS or the survey agency, at CMS's option, may revisit the facility to ensure that corrections are made.

        § 488.331   Informal dispute resolution.

#### § § 488.331

        (a)  (1) For non-Federal surveys, the State must offer a facility an informal opportunity, at the facility's request, to dispute survey findings upon the facility's receipt of the official statement of deficiencies.

        (2) For Federal surveys, CMS offers a facility an informal opportunity, at the facility's request, to dispute survey findings upon the facility's receipt of the official statement of deficiencies.

        (3) For SNFs, dually-participating SNF/NFs, and NF-only facilities that have civil money penalties imposed by CMS that will be placed in a CMS escrow account, CMS also offers the facility an opportunity for independent informal dispute resolution, subject to the terms of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and of § 488.431. The facility must request independent informal dispute resolution in writing within 10 days of receipt of CMS's offer. However, a facility may not use the dispute resolution processes at both §§ 488.331 and 488.431 for the same deficiency citation arising from the same survey unless the informal dispute resolution process at § 488.331 was completed prior to the imposition of the civil money penalty.

        (b)(1) Failure of the State or CMS, as appropriate, to complete informal dispute resolution timely cannot delay the effective date of any enforcement action against the facility.

        (2) A facility may not seek a delay of any enforcement action against it on the grounds that informal dispute resolution has not been completed before the effective date of the enforcement action.

        (c) If a provider is subsequently successful, during the informal dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that deficiencies should not have been cited, the deficiencies are removed from the statement of deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as a result of those cited deficiencies are rescinded.

        (d)  Upon request, CMS does and the State must provide the facility with written notification of the informal dispute resolution process.

        (2) The State survey agency takes appropriate precautions to protect a complainant's anonymity and privacy, if possible.

        (3) If arrangements have been made with other State components for investigation of complaints, the State must have a means of communicating information among appropriate entities, and the State survey agency retains responsibility for the investigation process.

        (4) If, after investigating a complaint, the State has reason to believe that an identifiable individual neglected or abused a resident, or misappropriated a resident's property, the State survey agency must act on the complaint in accordance with § 488.335.

        (b)  The State survey agency conducts on-site monitoring on an as necessary basis when—

        (1) A facility is not in substantial compliance with the requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies;

        (2) A facility has corrected deficiencies and verification of continued substantial compliance is needed; or

        (3) The survey agency has reason to question the substantial compliance of the facility with a requirement of participation.

        (c)  A State may use a specialized team, which may include an attorney, auditor and appropriate health professionals, to identify, survey, gather and preserve evidence, and administer remedies to noncompliant facilities.

        § 488.334   Educational programs.

#### § § 488.334

        A State must conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of SNFs and NFs in order to present current regulations, procedures, and policies on the survey, certification and enforcement process under this subpart and subpart F of this part.

#### § § 488.335

        (a)  (1) The State must review all allegations of resident neglect and abuse, and misappropriation of resident property and follow procedures specified in § 488.332.

        (2) If there is reason to believe, either through oral or written evidence that an individual used by a facility to provide services to residents could have abused or neglected a resident or misappropriated a resident's property, the State must investigate the allegation.

        (3) The State must have written procedures for the timely review and investigation of allegations of resident abuse and neglect, and misappropriation of resident property.

        (b)  The State must review all allegations regardless of the source.

        (c) —(1)  If the State makes a preliminary determination, based on oral or written evidence and its investigation, that the abuse, neglect or misappropriation of property occurred, it must notify in writing—

        (vi) Consequences of waiving the right to a hearing;

        (vii) Consequences of a finding through the hearing process that the alleged resident abuse or neglect, or misappropriation of resident property did occur; and

        (viii) Fact that the individual has the right to be represented by an attorney at the individual's own expense.

        (d)  (1) The State must complete the hearing and the hearing record within 120 days from the day it receives the request for a hearing.

        (2) The State must hold the hearing at a reasonable place and time convenient for the individual.

        (e)  A State must not make a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the individual.

        means a factual and temporal occurrence(s) when a facility is not in substantial compliance with the requirements for participation. Each instance of noncompliance is sufficient to constitute a deficiency and a deficiency may comprise of multiple instances of noncompliance.

        means a resident who is admitted to the facility on or after the effective date of a denial of payment remedy and, if previously admitted, has been discharged before that effective date. Residents admitted before the effective date of the denial of payment, and taking temporary leave, are not considered new admissions, nor subject to the denial of payment.

        means a plan developed by the facility and approved by CMS or the survey agency that describes the actions the facility will take to correct deficiencies and specifies the date by which those deficiencies will be corrected.

        (b)  When CMS or the State chooses to apply one or more remedies specified in § 488.406, the remedies are applied on the basis of noncompliance found during surveys conducted by CMS or by the survey agency.

        (c)  CMS or the State may apply one or more remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance or for all deficiencies constituting noncompliance.

        (d)  (1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, regardless of which remedy is applied, each facility that has deficiencies with respect to program requirements must submit a plan of correction for approval by CMS or the survey agency.

        (2)  A facility is not required to submit a plan of correction when it has deficiencies that are isolated and have a potential for minimal harm, but no actual harm has occurred.

        (e)  If the State and CMS disagree on the decision to impose a remedy, the disagreement is resolved in accordance with § 488.452.

        (f) —(1) Except when the State is taking action against a non-State operated NF, CMS or the State (as authorized by CMS) gives the provider notice of the remedy, including the—

        (ii) Which remedy is imposed;

        (iii) Effective date of the remedy; and

        (iv) Right to appeal the determination leading to the remedy.

        (2) When a State is taking action against a non-State operated NF, the State's notice must include the same information required by CMS in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

        (3)  Except for civil money penalties and State monitoring imposed when there is immediate jeopardy, for all remedies specified in § 488.406 imposed when there is immediate jeopardy, the notice must be given at least 2 calendar days before the effective date of the enforcement action.

        (4)  Except for civil money penalties and State monitoring, notice must be given at least 15 calendar days before the effective date of the enforcement action in situations in which there is no immediate jeopardy.

        (5)  The 2-and 15-day notice periods begin when the facility receives the notice.

        (6)  For civil money penalties, the notices must be given in accordance with the provisions of §§ 488.434 and 488.440.

        (7)  For State monitoring, no prior notice is required.

        § 488.404   Factors to be considered in selecting remedies.

#### § § 488.404

        (a)  In order to select the appropriate remedy, if any, to apply to a facility with deficiencies, CMS and the State determine the seriousness of the deficiencies.

        (b)  To determine the seriousness of the deficiency, CMS considers and the State must consider at least the following factors:

        (1) Whether a facility's deficiencies constitute—

        (i) No actual harm with a potential for minimal harm;

        (ii) No actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, but not immediate jeopardy;

        (iii) Actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy; or

        (iv) Immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.

        (2) Whether the deficiencies—

        (i) Are isolated;

        (ii) Constitute a pattern; or

        (iii) Are widespread.

        (c)  Following the initial assessment, CMS and the State may consider other factors, which may include, but are not limited to the following:

        (1) The relationship of the one deficiency to other deficiencies resulting in noncompliance.

        (2) The facility's prior history of noncompliance in general and specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.

        (6) State monitoring.

        (c)  If a State wishes to use remedies for noncompliance that are either additional or alternative to those specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, it must—

        (1) Specify those remedies in the State plan; and

        (2) Demonstrate to CMS's satisfaction that those remedies are as effective as the remedies listed in paragraph (a) of this section, for deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies.

        (d)  If the State's remedy is unique to the State plan and has been approved by CMS, then that remedy, as imposed by the State under its Medicaid authority, may be imposed by CMS against the Medicare provider agreement of a dually participating facility.

        (a)  In this section, the remedies specified in § 488.406(a) are grouped into categories and applied to deficiencies according to how serious the noncompliance is.

        (b)  After considering the factors specified in § 488.404, as applicable, if CMS and the State choose to impose remedies, as provided in paragraphs (c)(1), (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section, for facility noncompliance, instead of, or in addition to, termination of the provider agreement, CMS does and the State must follow the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c)(2), (d)(2), and (e)(2) of this section, as applicable.

        (c)  (1) Category 1 remedies include the following:

        (i) Directed plan of correction.

        (ii) State monitoring.

        (2) When there are one or more deficiencies that constitute immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety—

        (i) CMS does and the State must do one or both of the following:

        (A) Impose temporary management; or

        § 488.410   Action when there is immediate jeopardy.

#### § § 488.410

        (a) If there is immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, the State must (and CMS does) either terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last date of the survey or appoint a temporary manager to remove the immediate jeopardy. The rules for appointment of a temporary manager in an immediate jeopardy situation are as follows:

        (1) CMS does and the State must notify the facility that a temporary manager is being appointed.

        (2) If the facility fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, CMS does and the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey, if the immediate jeopardy is not removed. In these cases, State monitoring may be imposed pending termination.

        (3) If the facility relinquishes control to the temporary manager, the State must (and CMS does) notify the facility that, unless it removes the immediate jeopardy, its provider agreement will be terminated within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey.

        (4) CMS does and the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of survey if the immediate jeopardy has not been removed.

        (b) CMS or the State may also impose other remedies, as appropriate.

        (c)(1) In a NF or dually participating facility, if either CMS or the State finds that a facility's noncompliance poses immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, CMS or the State must notify the other of such a finding.

        (2) CMS will or the State must do one or both of the following:

        (i) Take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the noncompliance through temporary management.

        (ii) Terminate the facility's participation under the State plan. If this is done, CMS will also terminate the facility's participation in Medicare if it is a dually participating facility.

        (d) The State must provide for the safe and orderly transfer of residents when the facility is terminated.

        (e) If the immediate jeopardy is also substandard quality of care, the State survey agency must notify attending physicians and the State board responsible for licensing the facility administrator of the finding of substandard quality of care, as specified in § 488.325(h).

        § 488.412   Action when there is no immediate jeopardy.

#### § § 488.412

        (a) If a facility's deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to residents' health or safety, and the facility is not in substantial compliance, CMS or the State may terminate the facility's provider agreement or may allow the facility to continue to participate for no longer than 6 months from the last day of the survey if—

        (1) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility's provider agreement;

        (2) The State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action approved by CMS; and

        (3) The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State in the case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay to the Federal government payments received after the last day of the survey that first identified the deficiencies if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction.

        (b) If a facility does not meet the criteria for continuation of payment under paragraph (a) of this section, CMS will and the State must terminate the facility's provider agreement.

        (c) CMS does and the State must deny payment for new admissions when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last day of the survey.

        (d) CMS terminates the provider agreement for SNFs and NFs, and stops FFP to a State for a NF for which participation was continued under paragraph (a) of this section, if the facility is not in substantial compliance within 6 months of the last day of the survey.

        § 488.414   Action when there is repeated substandard quality of care.

#### § § 488.414

        (a)  If a facility has been found to have provided substandard quality of care on the last three consecutive standard surveys, as defined in § 488.305, regardless of other remedies provided—

        (1) CMS imposes denial of payment for all new admissions, as specified in § 488.417, or denial of all payments, as specified in § 488.418;

        (2) The State must impose denial of payment for all new admissions, as specified in § 488.417; and

        (3) CMS does and the State survey agency must impose State monitoring, as specified in § 488.422, until the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of CMS or the State, that it is in substantial compliance with all requirements and will remain in substantial compliance with all requirements.

        (b)  For purposes of this section, repeated noncompliance is based on the repeated finding of substandard quality of care and not on the basis that the substance of the deficiency or the exact tag number for the deficiency was repeated.

        (c)  Standard surveys completed by the State survey agency on or after October 1, 1990, are used to determine whether the threshold of three consecutive standard surveys is met.

        (d)  (1) The determination that a certified facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care is made without regard to any variances in the facility's program participation (that is, any standard survey completed for Medicare, Medicaid or both programs will be considered).

        (2) Termination would allow the count of repeated substandard quality of care surveys to start over.

        (3) Change of ownership. (i) A facility may not avoid a remedy on the basis that it underwent a change of ownership.

        (ii) In a facility that has undergone a change of ownership, CMS does not and the State may not restart the count of repeated substandard quality of care surveys unless the new owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of CMS or the State that the poor past performance no longer is a factor due to the change in ownership.

        (e)  (1) If a penalty is imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, it will continue until the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of CMS or the State that it is in substantial compliance with the requirements and that it will remain in substantial compliance with the requirements for a period of time specified by CMS or the State.

        (2) A facility will not avoid the imposition of remedies or the obligation to demonstrate that it will remain in compliance when it—

        (i) Alleges correction of the deficiencies cited in the most recent standard survey; or

        (ii) Achieves compliance before the effective date of the remedies.

        § 488.415   Temporary management.

#### § § 488.415

        (a)  Temporary management means the temporary appointment by CMS or the State of a substitute facility manager or administrator with authority to hire, terminate or reassign staff, obligate facility funds, alter facility procedures, and manage the facility to correct deficiencies identified in the facility's operation.

        (b)  The temporary manager must—

        (1) Be qualified to oversee correction of deficiencies on the basis of experience and education, as determined by the State;

        (2) Not have been found guilty of misconduct by any licensing board or professional society in any State;

        (3) Have, or a member of his or her immediate family have, no financial ownership interest in the facility; and

        (4) Not currently serve or, within the past 2 years, have served as a member of the staff of the facility.

        (c)  The temporary manager's salary—

        (1) Is paid directly by the facility while the temporary manager is assigned to that facility; and

        (2) Must be at least equivalent to the sum of the following—

        (i) The prevailing salary paid by providers for positions of this type in what the State considers to be the facility's geographic area;

        (ii) Additional costs that would have reasonably been incurred by the provider if such person had been in an employment relationship; and

        (iii) Any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing services under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State.

        (3) May exceed the amount specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the State is otherwise unable to attract a qualified temporary manager.

        (d) —(1)  If a facility fails to relinquish authority to the temporary manager as described in this section, CMS will or the State must terminate the provider agreement in accordance with § 488.456.

        (2)  A facility's failure to pay the salary of the temporary manager is considered a failure to relinquish authority to temporary management.

        (e)  Temporary management ends when the facility meets any of the conditions specified in § 488.454(c).

        § 488.417   Denial of payment for all new admissions.

#### § § 488.417

        (a)  Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, CMS or the State may deny payment for all new admissions when a facility is not in substantial compliance with the requirements, as defined in § 488.401, as follows:

        (2) The State survey agency has cited a facility with substandard quality of care on the last three consecutive standard surveys.

        (c)  When a facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care, payments to the facility or, under Medicaid, CMS payments to the State on behalf of the facility, resume on the date that—

        (1) The facility achieves substantial compliance as indicated by a revisit or written credible evidence acceptable to CMS (for all facilities except non-State operated NFs against which CMS is imposing no remedies) or the State (for non-State operated NFs against which CMS is imposing no remedies); and

        (2) CMS (for all facilities except non-State operated NFs against which CMS is imposing no remedies) or the State (for non-State operated NFs against which CMS is imposing no remedies) believes that the facility is capable of remaining in substantial compliance.

        (d)  When a facility does not have repeated instances of substandard quality of care, payments to the facility or, under Medicaid, CMS payments to the State on behalf of the facility, resume prospectively on the date that the facility achieves substantial compliance, as indicated by a revisit or written credible evidence acceptable to CMS (under Medicare) or the State (under Medicaid).

        (e)  No payments to a facility or, under Medicaid, CMS payments to the State on behalf of the facility, are made for the period between the date that the—

        (c)  If payment to the facility or to the State resumes after denial of payment for all residents, no payment is made for the period between the date that—

        (1) Denial of payment was imposed; and

        (2) CMS verifies as the date that the facility achieved substantial compliance.

        (d)  Except when a facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, when CMS or the State finds that the facility was in substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, or before CMS or the survey agency received credible evidence of such compliance, payment is resumed on the date that substantial compliance was achieved, as determined by CMS.

        § 488.430   Civil money penalties: Basis for imposing penalty.

#### § § 488.430

        (a) CMS or the State may impose a civil money penalty for the number of days a facility is not in substantial compliance with one or more participation requirements or for each instance that a facility is not in substantial compliance, or both, regardless of whether or not the deficiencies constitute immediate jeopardy. When a survey contains multiple instances of noncompliance, CMS or the State may impose any combination of per instance or per day civil money penalties for each instance of noncompliance within the same survey.

        (b) CMS or the State may impose a civil money penalty for the number of days or instances of previously cited noncompliance, including the number of days of immediate jeopardy, since the last three standard surveys.

        § 488.431   Civil money penalties imposed by CMS and independent informal dispute resolution: for SNFS, dually-participating SNF/NFs, and NF-only facilities.

#### § § 488.431

        (a)  CMS retains ultimate authority for the survey findings and imposition of civil money penalties, but provides an opportunity for independent informal dispute resolution within 30 days of notice of imposition of a civil money penalty that will be placed in escrow in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. An independent informal dispute resolution will—

        (1) Be completed within 60 days of facility's request if an independent informal dispute resolution is timely requested by the facility.

        (2) Generate a written record prior to the collection of the penalty.

        (3) Include notification to an involved resident or resident representative, as well as the State's long term care ombudsman, to provide opportunity for written comment.

        (4) Be approved by CMS and conducted by the State under section 1864 of the Act, or by an entity approved by the State and CMS, or by CMS or its agent in the case of surveys conducted only by federal surveyors where the State independent dispute resolution process is not used, and which has no conflict of interest, such as:

        (i) A component of an umbrella State agency provided that the component is organizationally separate from the State survey agency.

        (ii) An independent entity with a specific understanding of Medicare and Medicaid program requirements selected by the State and approved by CMS.

        (5) Not include the survey findings that have already been the subject of an informal dispute resolution under § 488.331 for the particular deficiency citations at issue in the independent process under § 488.431, unless the informal dispute resolution under § 488.331 was completed prior to the imposition of the civil money penalty.

        (b)  (1) For both per day and per instance civil money penalties, CMS may collect and place the imposed civil money penalties in an escrow account on whichever of the following occurs first:

        (i) The date on which the independent informal dispute resolution process is completed under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (ii) The date that is 90 days after the date of the notice of imposition of the penalty.

        (2) For collection and placement in escrow accounts of per day civil money penalties, CMS may collect the portion of the per day civil money penalty that has accrued up to the time of collection as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. CMS may make additional collections periodically until the full amount is collected, except that the full balance must be collected once the facility achieves substantial compliance or is terminated from the program and CMS determines the final amount of the civil money penalty imposed.

        (3) CMS may provide for an escrow payment schedule that differs from the collection times of paragraph (1) of this subsection in any case in which CMS determines that more time is necessary for deposit of the total civil money penalty into an escrow account, not to exceed 12 months, if CMS finds that immediate payment would create substantial and undue financial hardship on the facility.

        (4) If the full civil money penalty is not placed in an escrow account within 30 calendar days from the date the provider receives notice of collection, or within 30 calendar days of any due date established pursuant to a hardship finding under paragraph (b)(3), CMS may deduct the amount of the civil money penalty from any sum then or later owed by CMS or the State to the facility in accordance with § 488.442(c).

        (5) For any civil money penalties that are not collected and placed into an escrow account under this section, CMS will collect such civil money penalties in the same manner as the State in accordance with § 488.432.

        (c)  CMS will maintain collected civil money penalties in an escrow account pending the resolution of any administrative appeal of the deficiency findings that comprise the basis for the civil monetary penalty imposition. CMS will retain the escrowed funds on an on-going basis and, upon a final administrative decision, will either return applicable funds in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section or, in the case of an unsuccessful administrative appeal, will periodically disburse the funds to States or other entities in accordance with § 488.433.

        (d)  (1) A facility must request a hearing on the determination of the noncompliance that is the basis for imposition of the civil money penalty as specified in § 498.40 of this chapter.

        (2) If the administrative law judge reverses deficiency findings that comprise the basis of a civil money penalty in whole or in part, the escrowed amounts continue to be held pending expiration of the time for CMS to appeal the decision or, where CMS does appeal, a Departmental Appeals Board decision affirming the reversal of the pertinent deficiency findings. Any collected civil money penalty amount owed to the facility based on a final administrative decision will be returned to the facility with applicable interest as specified in section 1878(f)(2) of the Act.

        § 488.432   Civil money penalties imposed by the State: NF-only.

#### § § 488.432

        (a)  (1) When the State imposes a civil money penalty against a non-State operated NF that is not subject to imposition of remedies by CMS, the facility must request a hearing on the determination of noncompliance that is the basis for imposition of the civil money penalty within the time specified in § 431.153 of this chapter.

        (2)(i) If a facility requests a hearing within the time frame specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for a civil money penalty imposed per day, the State initiates collection of the penalty when there is a final administrative decision that upholds the State's determination of noncompliance after the facility achieves substantial compliance or is terminated.

        (ii) If a facility requests a hearing for a civil money penalty imposed per instance of noncompliance within the time specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the State initiates collection of the penalty when there is a final administrative decision that upholds the State's determination of noncompliance.

        (b)  (1) If a facility does not request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the State initiates collection of the penalty when the facility—

        (i) Achieves substantial compliance; or

        (ii) Is terminated.

        (2)  If a facility does not request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the State initiates collection of the penalty when the time frame for requesting a hearing expires.

        (c)  (1) If a facility waives its right to a hearing as specified in § 488.436, the State initiates collection of civil money penalty imposed per day of noncompliance after 60 days from the date of the notice imposing the penalty and the State has not received a timely request for a hearing.

        (2) If a facility waives its right to a hearing as specified in § 488.436, the State initiates collection of civil money penalty imposed per instance of noncompliance after 60 days from the date of the notice imposing the penalty and the State has not received a timely request for a hearing.

        (d) Accrual and computation of penalties for a facility that—

        (1) Requests a hearing or does not request a hearing are specified in § 488.440;

        (2) Waives its right to a hearing in writing, are specified in §§ 488.436(b) and 488.440.

        § 488.433   Civil money penalties: Uses and approval of civil money penalties imposed by CMS.

#### § § 488.433

        (a) Ten percent of the collected civil money penalty funds that are required to be held in escrow pursuant to § 488.431 and that remain after a final administrative decision will be deposited with the Department of the Treasury in accordance with § 488.442(f). The remaining ninety percent of the collected civil money penalty funds that are required to be held in escrow pursuant to § 488.431 and that remain after a final administrative decision must be used entirely for activities that protect or improve the quality of care or quality of life for residents consistent with paragraph (b) of this section and may not be used for survey and certification operations or State expenses, except that reasonable expenses necessary to administer, monitor, or evaluate the effectiveness of projects utilizing civil money penalty funds may be permitted.

        (b) All activities and plans for utilizing civil money penalty funds, including any expense used to administer grants utilizing civil money penalty funds, must be approved in advance by CMS and may include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Support and protection of residents of a facility that closes (voluntarily or involuntarily).

        (2) Time-limited expenses incurred in the process of relocating residents to home and community-based settings or another facility when a facility is closed (voluntarily or involuntarily) or downsized pursuant to an agreement with the State Medicaid agency.

        (3) Projects that support resident and family councils and other consumer involvement in assuring quality care in facilities.

        (4) Facility improvement initiatives, such as joint training of facility staff and surveyors or technical assistance for facilities implementing quality assurance and performance improvement programs.

        (5) Development and maintenance of temporary management or receivership capability such as but not limited to, recruitment, training, retention or other system infrastructure expenses. However, as specified in § 488.415(c), a temporary manager's salary must be paid by the facility. In rare situations, if the facility is closing, CMS plans to stop or suspend continued payments to the facility under § 489.55 of this chapter during the temporary manager's duty period, and CMS determines that extraordinary action is necessary to protect the residents until relocation efforts are successful, civil money penalty funds may be used to pay the manager's salary.

        (c) At a minimum, proposed activities submitted to CMS for prior approval must include a description of the intended outcomes, deliverables, and sustainability; and a description of the methods by which the activity results will be assessed, including specific measures.

        (d) Civil money penalty funds may not be used for activities that have been disapproved by CMS.

        (e) The State must maintain an acceptable plan, approved by CMS, for the effective use of civil money funds, including a description of methods by which the State will:

        (1) Solicit, accept, monitor, and track projects utilizing civil money penalty funds including any funds used for state administration.

        (2) Make information about the use of civil money penalty funds publicly available, including about the dollar amount awarded for approved projects, the grantee or contract recipients, the results of projects, and other key information.

        (3) Ensure that:

        (i) A core amount of civil money penalty funds will be held in reserve for emergencies, such as relocation of residents pursuant to an involuntary termination from Medicare and Medicaid.

        (ii) A reasonable amount of funds, beyond those held in reserve under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, will be awarded or contracted each year for the purposes specified in this section.

        (f) If CMS finds that a State has not spent civil money penalty funds in accordance with this section, or fails to make use of funds to benefit the quality of care or life of residents, or fails to maintain an acceptable plan for the use of funds that is approved by CMS, then CMS may withhold future disbursements of civil money penalty funds to the State until the State has submitted an acceptable plan to comply with this section.

#### § § 488.436

        (a)  A facility is considered to have waived its right to a hearing after 60 days from the date of the notice imposing the civil money penalty if CMS has not received a request for a hearing from the facility.

        (b)  (1) If the facility waives its right to a hearing in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, CMS or the State reduces the civil money penalty by 35 percent, as long as the civil money penalty has not also been reduced by 50 percent under § 488.438.

        (2) If the facility does not waive its right to a hearing in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the civil money penalty is not reduced by 35 percent.

        § 488.438   Civil money penalties: Amount of penalty.

#### § § 488.438

        (a)  (1) The penalties are within the following ranges, set at $50 increments:

        (i)  Penalties in the range of $3,050-$10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day are imposed for deficiencies constituting immediate jeopardy, and as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (ii)  Penalties in the range of $50-$3,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day are imposed for deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy, but either caused actual harm, or caused no actual harm, but have the potential for more than minimal harm.

        (2)  When penalties are imposed for an instance of noncompliance, the penalties will be in the range of $1,000-$10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per instance.

        (b)  The amount of penalty is based on CMS's or the State's assessment of factors listed in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (c)  (1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if immediate jeopardy is removed, but the noncompliance continues, CMS or the State will shift the penalty amount imposed per day to the lower range.

        (2) When CMS determines that a SNF, dually-participating SNF/NF, or NF-only facility subject to a civil money penalty imposed by CMS self-reports and promptly corrects the noncompliance for which the civil money penalty was imposed, CMS will reduce the amount of the penalty by 50 percent, provided that all of the following apply —

        (i) The facility self-reported the noncompliance to CMS or the State before it was identified by CMS or the State and before it was reported to CMS or the State by means of a complaint lodged by a person other than an official representative of the nursing home;

        (ii) Correction of the self-reported noncompliance occurred on whichever of the following occurs first:

        (A) 15 calendar days from the date of the circumstance or incident that later resulted in a finding of noncompliance; or

        (B) 10 calendar days from the date the civil money penalty was imposed;

        (iii) The facility waives its right to a hearing under § 488.436;

        (iv) The noncompliance that was self-reported and corrected did not constitute a pattern of harm, widespread harm, immediate jeopardy, or result in the death of a resident;

        (v) The civil money penalty was not imposed for a repeated deficiency, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that was the basis of a civil money penalty that previously received a reduction under this section; and

        (vi) The facility has met mandatory reporting requirements for the incident or circumstance upon which the civil money penalty is based, as required by Federal and State law.

        (3) Under no circumstances will a facility receive both the 50 percent civil money penalty reduction for self-reporting and correcting under this section and the 35 percent civil money penalty reduction for waiving its right to a hearing under § 488.436.

        (d)  (1) Before a hearing requested in accordance with § 488.431(d) or § 488.432(a), CMS or the State may propose to increase the per day penalty amount for facility noncompliance which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount, becomes sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.

        (2) CMS does and the State must increase the per day penalty amount for any repeated deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was previously imposed, regardless of whether the increased penalty amount would exceed the range otherwise reserved for nonimmediate jeopardy deficiencies.

        (3) Repeated deficiencies are deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements found at the last survey, subsequently corrected, and found again at the next survey.

        (e)  When an administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) finds that the basis for imposing a civil money penalty exists, as specified in § 488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not—

        (1) Set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero;

        (2) Review the exercise of discretion by CMS or the State to impose a civil money penalty; and

        (3) Consider any factors in reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those specified in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (f)  In determining the amount of penalty, CMS does or the State must take into account the following factors:

        (1) The facility's history of noncompliance, including repeated deficiencies.

        (2) The facility's financial condition.

        (3) The factors specified in § 488.404.

        (4)  for purposes of this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, neglect, indifference, or disregard for resident care, comfort or safety. The absence of culpability is not a mitigating circumstance in reducing the amount of the penalty.

        (b) The per day civil money penalty is computed and collectible, as specified in §§ 488.431, 488.432, and 488.442 for the number of days of noncompliance until the date the facility achieves substantial compliance, or, if applicable, the date of termination when —

        (1) The determination of noncompliance is upheld after a final administrative decision for NFs-only subject to civil money penalties imposed by the state or for civil money penalties imposed by CMS that are not collected and placed into an escrow account;

        (2) The facility waives its right to a hearing in accordance with § 488.436; or

        (3) The time for requesting a hearing has expired and CMS or the State has not received a hearing request from the facility.

        (c)(1) For NFs-only subject to civil money penalties imposed by the State and for civil money penalties imposed by CMS that may not be placed in an escrow account, the entire penalty, whether imposed on a per day or per instance basis, is due and collectible as specified in the notice sent to the provider under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

        (2) For SNFs, dually-participating SNF/NFs, or NFs subject to civil money penalties imposed by CMS, collection is made in accordance with § 488.431.

        (d)(1) When a civil money penalty is imposed on a per day basis and the facility achieves substantial compliance, CMS does or the State must send a separate notice to the facility containing the following information:

        (i) The amount of penalty per day.

        (ii) The number of days involved.

        (iii) The total amount due.

        (iii) The due date of the penalty.

        (iv) The rate of interest assessed on the unpaid balance beginning on the due date, as provided in § 488.442.

        (e) In the case of a facility for which the provider agreement has been terminated and on which a civil money penalty was imposed on a per day basis, CMS does or the State must send this penalty information after the—

        (1) Final administrative decision is made;

        (2) Facility has waived its right to a hearing in accordance with § 488.436; or

        (3) Time for requesting a hearing has expired and CMS or the state has not received a hearing request from the facility.

        (f)  (1) In the case of noncompliance that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the daily accrual of per day civil money penalties is imposed for the days of noncompliance prior to the notice specified in § 488.434 and an additional period of no longer than 6 months following the last day of the survey.

        (2) After the period specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, if the facility has not achieved substantial compliance, CMS terminates the provider agreement and the State may terminate the provider agreement.

        (g)(1) In a case when per day civil money penalties are imposed, when a facility has deficiencies that pose immediate jeopardy, CMS does or the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days after the last day of the survey if the immediate jeopardy remains.

        (2) The accrual of the civil money penalty imposed on a per day basis stops on the day the provider agreement is terminated.

        (h)(1) If an on-site revisit is necessary to confirm substantial compliance and the provider can supply documentation acceptable to CMS or the State agency that substantial compliance was achieved on a date preceding the revisit, penalties imposed on a per day basis only accrue until that date of correction for which there is written credible evidence.

        (2) If an on-site revisit is not necessary to confirm substantial compliance, penalties imposed on a per day basis only accrue until the date of correction for which CMS or the State receives and accepts written credible evidence.

#### § § 488.442

        (a)  (1) Payment for a civil money penalty is due in accordance with § 488.431 of this chapter for CMS-imposed penalties and 15 days after the State initiates collection pursuant to § 488.432 of this chapter for State-imposed penalties, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.

        (2)  Except as provided for in § 488.431, a civil money penalty is due 75 days after the notice of the penalty in accordance with § 488.436 and a hearing request was not received when:

        (i) The facility achieved substantial compliance before the hearing request was due; or

        (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before the hearing request was due.

        (3)  A civil money penalty payment is due 15 days after the effective date of termination, if that date is earlier than the date specified in paragraph (a)(1)of this section.

#### § § 488.450

        (a)  (1) CMS may continue payments to a facility not in substantial compliance for the periods specified in paragraph (c) of this section if the following criteria are met:

        (i) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility;

        (ii) The State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action approved by CMS; and

        (iii) The facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to repay the Federal government payments received under this provision if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable for corrective action.

        (2) CMS or the State may terminate the SNF or NF agreement before the end of the correction period if the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met.

        (b)  If termination is not sought, either by itself or along with another remedy or remedies, or any of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met or agreed to by either the facility or the State, the facility or State will receive no Medicare or Federal Medicaid payments, as applicable, from the last day of the survey.

        (c) —(1)  If the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met, CMS may continue payments to a Medicare facility or the State for a Medicaid facility with noncompliance that does not constitute immediate jeopardy for up to 6 months from the last day of the survey.

        (2)  In the case of a facility closure, the Secretary may, as the Secretary determines appropriate, continue to make payments with respect to residents of a long-term care facility that has submitted a notification of closure during the period beginning on the date such notification is submitted to CMS and ending on the date on which the residents are successfully relocated.

        (d)  If the facility does not achieve substantial compliance by the end of the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section,

        (1) CMS will—

        (i) Terminate the provider agreement of the Medicare SNF in accordance with § 488.456; or

#### § § 488.452

        The following rules apply when CMS and the State disagree over findings of noncompliance or application of remedies in a non-State operated NF or dually participating facility:

        (a)  (1) The State's finding of noncompliance takes precedence when—

        (i) CMS finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is in substantial compliance with the participation requirements; and

        (ii) The State finds that a NF or dually participating facility has not achieved substantial compliance.

        (2) CMS's findings of noncompliance take precedence when—

        (i) CMS finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and

        (ii) The State finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is in substantial compliance with the participation requirements.

        (3) When CMS's survey findings take precedence, CMS may—

        (i) Impose any of the alternative remedies specified in § 488.406;

        (ii) Terminate the provider agreement subject to the applicable conditions of § 488.450; and

        (iii) Stop FFP to the State for a NF.

        (b)  (1) CMS's decision to terminate the participation of a facility takes precedence when—

        (i) Both CMS and the State find that the facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and

        (ii) CMS, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation should be terminated. CMS will permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination not to exceed 6 months, if the applicable conditions of § 488.450 are met.

        (2) The State's decision to terminate a facility's participation and the procedures for appealing such termination, as specified in § 431.153(c) of this chapter, takes precedence when—

        (i) The State, but not CMS, finds that a NF's participation should be terminated; and

        (ii) The State's effective date for the termination of the NF's provider agreement is no later than 6 months after the last day of survey.

        (c)  The State's timing of termination takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 months after the last day of the survey when both CMS and the State find that—

        (1) A facility is not in substantial compliance; and

        (2) The facility's participation should be terminated.

        (d)  (1) When CMS or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, the additional or alternative remedies will also apply when—

        (i) Both CMS and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and

        (ii) Both CMS and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists.

        (2)  When CMS and the State establish one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, only the CMS remedies apply when both CMS and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance.

        (e) Regardless of whether CMS's or the State's decision controls, only one noncompliance and enforcement decision is applied to the Medicaid agreement, and for a dually participating facility, that same decision will apply to the Medicare agreement.

        § 488.454   Duration of remedies.

#### § § 488.454

        (a) Except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, alternative remedies continue until—

        (1) The facility has achieved substantial compliance, as determined by CMS or the State based upon a revisit or after an examination of credible written evidence that it can verify without an on-site visit; or

        (2) CMS or the State terminates the provider agreement.

        (b) In the cases of State monitoring and denial of payment imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, remedies continue until—

        (1) CMS or the State determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance and is capable of remaining in substantial compliance; or

        (2) CMS or the State terminates the provider agreement.

        (c) In the case of temporary management, the remedy continues until—

        (1) CMS or the State determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance and is capable of remaining in substantial compliance;

        (2) CMS or the State terminates the provider agreement; or

        (3) The facility which has not achieved substantial compliance reassumes management control. In this case, CMS or the State initiates termination of the provider agreement and may impose additional remedies.

        (d) In the case of a civil money penalty imposed for an instance of noncompliance, the remedy is the specific amount of the civil money penalty imposed for the particular deficiency.

        (e) If the facility can supply documentation acceptable to CMS or the State survey agency that it was in substantial compliance and was capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if necessary, on a date preceding that of the revisit, the remedies terminate on the date that CMS or the State can verify as the date that substantial compliance was achieved and the facility demonstrated that it could maintain substantial compliance, if necessary.

        (2) At least 15 calendar days before the effective date of termination for a facility with non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies that constitute noncompliance.

        (d)  (1) CMS terminates the provider agreement in accordance with procedures set forth in § 489.53 of this chapter; and

        (2) The State must terminate the provider agreement of a NF in accordance with procedures specified in parts 431 and 442 of this chapter.

        § 488.604   Termination of Medicare coverage.

#### § § 488.604

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, failure of a supplier of ESRD services to meet one or more of the conditions for coverage set forth in part 494 of this chapter will result in termination of Medicare coverage of the services furnished by the supplier.

        (b) If termination of coverage is based solely on a supplier's failure to participate in network activities and pursue network goals, as required at § 494.180(i) of this chapter, coverage may be reinstated when CMS determines that the supplier is making reasonable and appropriate efforts to meet that condition.

        (c) If termination of coverage is based on failure to meet any of the other conditions specified in part 494 of this chapter, coverage will not be reinstated until CMS finds that the reason for termination has been removed and there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.

        § 488.606   Alternative sanctions.

#### § § 488.606

        (a)  CMS may, as an alternative to termination of Medicare coverage, impose one of the sanctions specified in paragraph (b) of this section if CMS finds that—

        (1) The supplier fails to participate in the activities and pursue the goals of the ESRD network that is designated to encompass the supplier's geographic area; and

        (2) This failure does not jeopardize patient health and safety.

        (1) Denial of payment for services furnished to patients first accepted for care after the effective date of the sanction as specified in the sanction notice.

        (2) Reduction of payments, for all ESRD services furnished by the supplier, by 20 percent for each 30-day period after the effective date of the sanction.

        (3) Withholding of all payments, without interest, for all ESRD services furnished by the supplier to Medicare beneficiaries.

        (c)  An alternative sanction remains in effect until CMS finds that the supplier is in substantial compliance with the requirement to cooperate in the network plans and goals, or terminates coverage of the supplier's services for lack of compliance.

        § 488.608   Notice of alternative sanction and appeal rights: Termination of coverage.

#### § § 488.608

        (a)  CMS gives the supplier and the general public notice of the alternative sanction and of the effective date of the sanction. The effective date of the alternative sanction is at least 30 days after the date of the notice.

        (b)  Termination of Medicare coverage of a supplier's ESRD services because the supplier no longer meets the conditions for coverage of its services is an initial determination appealable under part 498 of this chapter.

        § 488.610   Notice of appeal rights: Alternative sanctions.

#### § § 488.610

        If CMS proposes to apply an alternative sanction specified in § 488.606(b), the following rules apply:

        (a) CMS gives the facility notice of the proposed alternative sanction and 15 days in which to request a hearing.

        (b) If the facility requests a hearing, CMS provides an informal hearing by a CMS official who was not involved in making the appealed decision.

        (c) During the informal hearing, the facility—

        (1) May be represented by counsel;

        (2) Has access to the information on which the allegation was based; and

        (3) May present, orally or in writing, evidence and documentation to refute the finding of failure to participate in network activities and pursue network goals.

        (d) If the written decision of the informal hearing supports application of the alternative sanction, CMS provides the facility and the public, at least 30 days before the effective date of the alternative sanction, a written notice that specifies the effective date and the reasons for the alternative sanction.

#### § § 488.705

        As used in this subpart—

        means a focused survey other than a standard survey that gathers information on an HHA's compliance with fewer specific standards or conditions of participation. An abbreviated standard survey may be based on complaints received, a change of ownership or management, or other indicators of specific concern such as reapplication for Medicare billing privileges following a deactivation.

        means a survey that is conducted to investigate specific allegations of noncompliance.

        means noncompliance as described in § 488.24 of this part.

        means any deficiency found at the condition-level or standard-level.

        means a survey conducted to determine if deficiencies and/or deficient practice(s) exist that were not fully examined during the standard survey. The surveyors may review any additional requirements which would assist in making a compliance finding.

        means noncompliance with one or more of the standards that make up each condition of participation for HHAs.

        means a survey conducted in which the surveyor reviews the HHA's compliance with a select number of standards and/or conditions of participation in order to determine the quality of care and services furnished by an HHA as measured by indicators related to medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care.

        means noncompliance with one or more conditions of participation identified on a standard survey, including deficiencies which could result in actual or potential harm to patients of an HHA.

        § 488.715   Partial extended surveys.

#### § § 488.715

        A partial extended survey is conducted to determine if standard or condition-level deficiencies are present in the conditions of participation not fully examined during the standard survey and there are indications that a more comprehensive review of conditions of participation would determine if a deficient practice exists.

        § 488.720   Extended surveys.

#### § § 488.720

        (a)  The purpose of an extended survey is:

        (1) To review and identify the policies and procedures that caused an HHA to furnish substandard care.

        (2) To determine whether the HHA is in compliance with one or more or all additional conditions of participation not examined during the standard survey.

        (a)  All HHA surveys must be unannounced and conducted with procedures and scheduling that renders the onsite surveys as unpredictable in their timing as possible.

        (b)  CMS reviews each survey agency's scheduling and surveying procedures and practices to assure that the survey agency has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of a survey through the scheduling procedures and conduct of the surveys.

        (c)  Any individual who notifies an HHA, or causes an HHA to be notified, of the time or date on which a standard survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a Federal civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.

        § 488.735   Surveyor qualifications.

#### § § 488.735

        (a)  Surveys must be conducted by individuals who meet minimum qualifications prescribed by CMS. In addition, before any State or Federal surveyor may serve on an HHA survey team (except as a trainee), he/she must have successfully completed the relevant CMS-sponsored Basic HHA Surveyor Training Course and any associated course prerequisites. All surveyors must follow the principles set forth in § 488.24 through § 488.28 according to CMS policies and procedures for determining compliance with the conditions of participation.

        § 488.810   General provisions.

#### § § 488.810

        (a)  The purpose of sanctions is to ensure prompt compliance with program requirements in order to protect the health and safety of individuals under the care of an HHA.

        (b)  When CMS chooses to apply one or more sanctions specified in § 488.820, the sanctions are applied on the basis of noncompliance with one or more conditions of participation found through a survey and may be based on failure to correct previous deficiency findings as evidenced by repeat deficiencies.

        (c)  CMS may apply one or more sanctions for each deficiency constituting noncompliance or for all deficiencies constituting noncompliance.

        (d)  When CMS imposes a sanction, the sanction applies to the parent HHA and its respective branch offices.

        (e)  Regardless of which sanction is applied, a non-compliant HHA must submit a plan of correction for approval by CMS.

        (f) —(1)  CMS provides written notification to the HHA of the intent to impose the sanction.

        (2)  The notice periods specified in § 488.825(b) and § 488.830(b) begin the day after the HHA receives the notice.

        (g)  (1) The provisions of part 498 of this chapter apply when the HHA requests a hearing on a determination of noncompliance leading to the imposition of a sanction, including termination of the provider agreement.

        (2) A pending hearing does not delay the effective date of a sanction, including termination, against an HHA. Sanctions continue to be in effect regardless of the timing of any appeals proceedings.

        § 488.815   Factors to be considered in selecting sanctions.

#### § § 488.815

        CMS bases its choice of sanction or sanctions on consideration of one or more factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:

        (a) The extent to which the deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.

        (b) The nature, incidence, manner, degree, and duration of the deficiencies or noncompliance.

        (c) The presence of repeat deficiencies, the HHA's overall compliance history and any history of repeat deficiencies at either the parent or branch location.

        (d) The extent to which the deficiencies are directly related to a failure to provide quality patient care.

        (e) The extent to which the HHA is part of a larger organization with performance problems.

        (f) An indication of any system-wide failure to provide quality care.

        § 488.820   Available sanctions.

#### § § 488.820

        In addition to termination of the provider agreement, the following alternative sanctions are available:

        (a) Civil money penalties.

        (b) Suspension of payment for all new admissions.

        (c) Temporary management of the HHA.

        (d) Directed plan of correction, as set out at § 488.850.

        (e) Directed in-service training, as set out at § 488.855.

        § 488.825   Action when deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

#### § § 488.825

        (a)  If there is immediate jeopardy to the HHA's patient health or safety—

        (1) CMS immediately terminates the HHA provider agreement in accordance with § 489.53 of this chapter.

        (2) CMS terminates the HHA provider agreement no later than 23 days from the last day of the survey, if the immediate jeopardy has not been removed by the HHA.

        (3) In addition to a termination, CMS may impose one or more alternative sanctions, as appropriate.

        (b)  Except for civil money penalties, for all sanctions specified in § 488.820 that are imposed when there is immediate jeopardy, notice must be given at least 2 calendar days before the effective date of the enforcement action.

        (c)  An HHA, if its provider agreement terminated, is responsible for providing information, assistance, and arrangements necessary for the proper and safe transfer of patients to another local HHA within 30 days of termination. The State must assist the HHA in the safe and orderly transfer of care and services for the patients to another local HHA.

        § 488.830   Action when deficiencies are at the condition-level but do not pose immediate jeopardy.

#### § § 488.830

        (a)  If the HHA is no longer in compliance with the conditions of participation, either because the deficiency or deficiencies substantially limit the provider's capacity to furnish adequate care but do not pose immediate jeopardy, have a condition-level deficiency or deficiencies that do not pose immediate jeopardy, or because the HHA has repeat noncompliance that results in a condition-level deficiency based on the HHA's failure to correct and sustain compliance, CMS will:

        (1) Terminate the HHA's provider agreement; or

        (2) Impose one or more alternative sanctions set forth in § 488.820(a) through (f) of this part as an alternative to termination, for a period not to exceed 6 months.

        (b)  Except for civil money penalties, for all sanctions specified in § 488.820 imposed when there is no immediate jeopardy, notice must be given at least 15 calendar days before the effective date of the enforcement action. The requirements of the notice are set forth in § 488.810(f) of this part.

        (c)  If an HHA does not meet the criteria for continuation of payment under § 488.860(a) of this part, CMS will terminate the HHA's provider agreement in accordance with § 488.865 of this part.

        (d)  CMS terminates an HHA within 6 months of the last day of the survey, if the HHA is not in compliance with the conditions of participation, and the terms of the plan of correction have not been met.

        (e)  An HHA, if its provider agreement terminated, is responsible for providing information, assistance, and arrangements necessary for the proper and safe transfer of patients to another local HHA within 30 days of termination. The State must assist the HHA in the safe and orderly transfer of care and services for the patients to another local HHA.

        § 488.835   Temporary management.

#### § § 488.835

        (a)  (1) CMS may impose temporary management of an HHA if it determines that an HHA has a condition-level noncompliance and CMS determines that management limitations or the deficiencies are likely to impair the HHA's ability to correct deficiencies and return the HHA to full compliance with the conditions of participation within the timeframe required.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (b)  (1) CMS notifies the HHA that a temporary manager is being appointed.

        (2) If the HHA fails to relinquish authority and control to the temporary manager, CMS terminates the HHA's provider agreement in accordance with § 488.865.

        (c)  Temporary management continues until—

        (1) CMS determines that the HHA has achieved substantial compliance and has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the conditions of participation;

        (2) CMS terminates the provider agreement; or

        (3) The HHA reassumes management control without CMS approval. In such case, CMS initiates termination of the provider agreement and may impose additional sanctions.

        (4) Temporary management will not exceed a period of 6 months from the date of the survey identifying noncompliance.

        (d)  (1) The temporary manager's salary—

        (i) Is paid directly by the HHA while the temporary manager is assigned to that HHA; and

        (ii) Must be at least equivalent to the sum of the following:

        (A) The prevailing salary paid by providers for positions of this type in what the State considers to be the HHA's geographic area (prevailing salary based on the Geographic Guide by the Department of Labor (BLS Wage Data by Area and Occupation);

        (B) Any additional costs that would have reasonably been incurred by the HHA if such person had been in an employment relationship; and

        (C) Any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing services under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State.

        (2) An HHA's failure to pay the salary and other costs of the temporary manager described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is considered a failure to relinquish authority and control to temporary management.

        § 488.840   Suspension of payment for all new patient admissions.

#### § § 488.840

        (a)  (1) CMS may suspend payment for all new admissions if an HHA is found to have condition-level deficiencies, regardless of whether those deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (2) CMS will consider this sanction for any deficiency related to poor patient care outcomes, regardless of whether the deficiency poses immediate jeopardy.

        (b) —(1)  (i) Before suspending payments for new admissions, CMS provides the HHA notice of the suspension of payment for all new admissions as set forth in § 488.810(f). The CMS notice of suspension will include the nature of the noncompliance; the effective date of the sanction; and the right to appeal the determination leading to the sanction.

        (ii) The HHA may not charge a newly admitted HHA patient who is a Medicare beneficiary for services for which Medicare payment is suspended unless the HHA can show that, before initiating care, it gave the patient or his or her representative oral and written notice of the suspension of Medicare payment in a language and manner that the beneficiary or representative can understand.

        (2)  (i) Suspension of payment for all new admissions sanction may be imposed anytime an HHA is found to be out of substantial compliance.

        (ii) Suspension of payment for patients with new admissions will remain in place until CMS determines that the HHA has achieved substantial compliance or is involuntarily terminated with the conditions of participation, as determined by CMS.

        (3)  Payments to the HHA resume prospectively on the date that CMS determines that the HHA has achieved substantial compliance with the conditions of participation.

        (c)  This sanction ends when—

        (1) CMS determines that the HHA is in substantial compliance with all of the conditions of participation; or

        (2) When the HHA is terminated or CMS determines that the HHA is not in compliance with the conditions of participation at a maximum of 6 months from the date noncompliance was determined.

        § 488.845   Civil money penalties.

#### § § 488.845

        (a)  (1) CMS may impose a civil money penalty against an HHA for either the number of days the HHA is not in compliance with one or more conditions of participation or for each instance that an HHA is not in compliance, regardless of whether the HHA's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (2) CMS may impose a civil money penalty for the number of days of immediate jeopardy.

        (3) A per-day and a per-instance CMP may not be imposed simultaneously for the same deficiency.

        (b) —(1)  CMS takes into account the following factors in determining the amount of the penalty:

        (i) The factors set out at § 488.815.

        (ii) The size of an agency and its resources.

        (iii) Accurate and credible resources, such as PECOS, Medicare cost reports and Medicare/Medicaid claims information that provide information on the operation and resources of the HHA.

        (iv) Evidence that the HHA has a built-in, self-regulating quality assessment and performance improvement system to provide proper care, prevent poor outcomes, control patient injury, enhance quality, promote safety, and avoid risks to patients on a sustainable basis that indicates the ability to meet the conditions of participation and to ensure patient health and safety.

        (2)  Based on revisit survey findings, adjustments to penalties may be made after a review of the provider's attempted correction of deficiencies.

        (i) CMS may increase a CMP in increments based on a HHA's inability or failure to correct deficiencies, the presence of a system-wide failure in the provision of quality care, or a determination of immediate jeopardy with actual harm versus immediate jeopardy with potential for harm.

        (ii) CMS may also decrease a CMP in increments to the extent that it finds, pursuant to a revisit, that substantial and sustainable improvements have been implemented even though the HHA is not yet in full compliance with the conditions of participation.

        (iii) No penalty assessment will exceed $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each day of noncompliance.

        (3)  Penalties in the upper range of $8,500 to $10,000 as adjusted under 45 CFR part 102 per day of noncompliance are imposed for a condition-level deficiency that is immediate jeopardy. The penalty in this range will continue until compliance can be determined based on a revisit survey.

        (i) $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day for a deficiency or deficiencies that are immediate jeopardy and that result in actual harm.

        (ii) $9,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day for a deficiency or deficiencies that are immediate jeopardy and that result in a potential for harm.

        (iii) $8,500 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day for an isolated incident of noncompliance in violation of established HHA policy.

        (4)  Penalties in the range of $1,500-$8,500 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day of noncompliance are imposed for a repeat and/or condition-level deficiency that does not constitute immediate jeopardy, but is directly related to poor quality patient care outcomes.

        (5)  Penalties in this range of $500-$4,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 are imposed for a repeat and/or condition-level deficiency that does not constitute immediate jeopardy and that are related predominately to structure or process-oriented conditions (such as OASIS submission requirements) rather than directly related to patient care outcomes.

        (6)  Penalty imposed per instance of noncompliance may be assessed for one or more singular events of condition-level noncompliance that are identified and where the noncompliance was corrected during the onsite survey. When penalties are imposed for per instance of noncompliance, or more than one per instance of noncompliance, the penalties will be in the range of $1,000 to $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per instance, not to exceed $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 each day of noncompliance.

        (7)  If the immediate jeopardy situation is removed, but condition-level noncompliance continues, CMS will shift the penalty amount imposed per day from the upper range to the middle or lower range. An earnest effort to correct any systemic causes of deficiencies and sustain improvement must be evident.

        (8)  (i) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CMS will increase the per day penalty amount for any condition-level deficiency or deficiencies which, after imposition of a lower-level penalty amount, become sufficiently serious to pose potential harm or immediate jeopardy.

        (ii) CMS increases the per day penalty amount for deficiencies that are not corrected and found again at the time of revisit survey(s) for which a lower-level penalty amount was previously imposed.

        (iii) CMS may impose a more severe amount of penalties for repeated noncompliance with the same condition-level deficiency or uncorrected deficiencies from a prior survey.

        (c) —(1)  CMS provides the HHA with written notice of the intent to impose a civil money penalty. The notice includes the amount of the CMP being imposed, the basis for such imposition and the proposed effective date of the sanction.

        (2) —(i)  An HHA may request a hearing on the determination of the noncompliance that is the basis for imposition of the civil money penalty. The request must meet the requirements in § 498.40 of this chapter.

        (ii)  An HHA may waive the right to a hearing, in writing, within 60 days from the date of the notice imposing the civil money penalty. If an HHA timely waives its right to a hearing, CMS reduces the penalty amount by 35 percent, and the amount is due within 15 days of the HHAs agreeing in writing to waive the hearing. If the HHA does not waive its right to a hearing in accordance to the procedures specified in this subsection, the civil money penalty is not reduced by 35 percent.

        (d)  (1)(i) The per day civil money penalty may start accruing as early as the beginning of the last day of the survey that determines that the HHA was out of compliance, as determined by CMS.

        (ii) A civil money penalty for each per instance of noncompliance is imposed in a specific amount for that particular deficiency, with a maximum of $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day per HHA.

        (2) A penalty that is imposed per day and per instance of noncompliance may not be imposed simultaneously.

        (3)  (i) In the case of noncompliance that poses immediate jeopardy, CMS must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days after the last day of the survey if the immediate jeopardy is not removed.

        (ii) A penalty imposed per day of noncompliance will stop accruing on the day the provider agreement is terminated or the HHA achieves substantial compliance, whichever occurs first.

        (4)  (i) In the case of noncompliance that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the daily accrual of per day civil money penalties is imposed for the days of noncompliance prior to the notice specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and an additional period of no longer than 6 months following the last day of the survey.

        (ii) If the HHA has not achieved compliance with the conditions of participation, CMS terminates the provider agreement. The accrual of civil money penalty stops on the day the HHA agreement is terminated or the HHA achieves substantial compliance, whichever is earlier.

        (e)  (1) When a civil money penalty is imposed on a per day basis and the HHA achieves compliance with the conditions of participation as determined by a revisit survey, CMS sends a final notice to the HHA containing all of the following information:

        (i) The amount of penalty assessed per day.

        (ii) The total number of days of noncompliance.

        (iii) The total amount due.

        (iv) The due date of the penalty.

        (v) The rate of interest to be assessed on any unpaid balance beginning on the due date, as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

        (2) When a civil money penalty is imposed for per instance of noncompliance, CMS sends a notice to the HHA containing all of the following information:

        (i) The amount of the penalty that was assessed.

        (ii) The total amount due.

        (iii) The due date of the penalty.

        (iv) The rate of interest to be assessed on any unpaid balance beginning on the due date, as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

        (3) In the case of an HHA for which the provider agreement has been involuntarily terminated and for which a civil money penalty was imposed on a per day basis, CMS sends this penalty information after one of the following actions has occurred:

        (i) Final administrative decision is made.

        (ii) The HHA has waived its right to a hearing in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (iii) Time for requesting a hearing has expired and CMS has not received a hearing request from the HHA.

        (f)  A penalty is due and payable 15 days from notice of the final administrative decision.

        (1) Payments are due for all civil money penalties within 15 days:

        (i) After a final administrative decision when the HHA achieves substantial compliance before the final decision or the effective date of termination before final decision,

        (ii) After the time to appeal has expired and the HHA does not appeal or fails to timely appeal the initial determination,

        (iii) After CMS receives a written request from the HHA requesting to waive its right to appeal the determinations that led to the imposition of a sanction,

        (iv) After substantial compliance is achieved, or

        (v) After the effective date of termination.

        (2) A request for hearing does not delay the imposition of any penalty; it only potentially delays the collection of the final penalty amount.

        (3) If an HHA waives its right to a hearing according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, CMS will apply a 35 percent reduction to the CMP amount when:

        (i) The HHA achieved compliance with the conditions of participation before CMS received the written waiver of hearing; or

        (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before CMS received the written waiver of hearing.

        (4) The period of noncompliance may not extend beyond 6 months from the last day of the survey.

        (5) The amount of the penalty, when determined, may be deducted (offset) from any sum then or later owing by CMS or State Medicaid to the HHA.

        (6) Interest is assessed and accrues on the unpaid balance of a penalty, beginning on the due date. Interest is computed at the rate specified in § 405.378(d) of this chapter.

        (g) —(1)  Civil money penalties and any corresponding interest collected by CMS from Medicare and Medicaid participating HHAs are disbursed in proportion to average dollars spent by Medicare and Medicaid at the national level based on MSIS and HHA PPS data for a three year fiscal period.

        (i) Based on expenditures for the FY 2007-2009 period, the initial proportions to be disbursed are 63 percent returned to the U.S. Treasury and 37 percent returned to the State Medicaid agency.

        (ii) Beginning one year after the effective date of this section, CMS shall annually update these proportions based on the most recent 3-year fiscal period, prior to the year in which the CMP is imposed, for which CMS determines that the relevant data are essentially complete.

        (iii) The portion corresponding to the Medicare payments is returned to the U.S. Department of Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

        (iv) The portion corresponding to the Medicaid payments is returned to the State Medicaid agency.

        (2) Penalties may not be used for Survey and Certification operations nor as the State's Medicaid non-Federal medical assistance or administrative match.

        (h)  When an administrative law judge or state hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) finds that the basis for imposing a civil monetary penalty exists, as specified in this part, the administrative law judge, State hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not—

        (1) Set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero;

        (2) Review the exercise of discretion by CMS to impose a civil monetary penalty; and

        (3) Consider any factors in reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)—(1)  Before imposing the remedy in paragraph (a) of this section, CMS notifies the hospice program in accordance with § 488.1210(e) that a temporary manager is being appointed.

        (2)  If the hospice program fails to relinquish authority and control to the temporary manager, CMS terminates the hospice program's provider agreement in accordance with § 488.1265.

        (c) Temporary management continues until one of the following occur:

        (1) CMS determines that the hospice program has achieved substantial compliance and has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the conditions of participation.

        (2) CMS terminates the provider agreement.

        (3) The hospice program resumes management control without CMS approval. In this case, CMS initiates termination of the provider agreement and may impose additional remedies.

        (4) Temporary management will not exceed a period of 6 months from the date of the survey identifying noncompliance.

        (d) (1) The temporary manager's salary must meet the following:

        (i) Is paid directly by the hospice program while the temporary manager is assigned to that hospice program.

        (ii) Must be at least equivalent to the sum of the following:

        (A) The prevailing salary paid by providers for positions of this type in what the State considers to be the hospice program's geographic area (prevailing salary based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates).

        (B) Any additional costs that would have reasonably been incurred by the hospice program if such person had been in an employment relationship.

        (C) Any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing services under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State.

        (2) A hospice program's failure to pay the salary and other costs of the temporary manager described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is considered a failure to relinquish authority and control to temporary management.

        § 488.1240   Suspension of payment for all new patient admissions.

#### § § 488.1240

        (a) (1) CMS may suspend payment for all new admissions to a hospice program on or after the date on which the Secretary determines that remedies should be imposed.

        (2) CMS considers the remedy in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any deficiency related to poor patient care outcomes, regardless of whether the deficiency poses immediate jeopardy.

        (b)—(1)  (i) Before suspending payments for all new admissions, CMS provides the hospice program notice of the suspension of payment in accordance with § 488.1210(e).

        (ii) The hospice program may not charge a newly admitted hospice patient who is a Medicare beneficiary for services for which Medicare payment is suspended unless the hospice program can show that, before initiating care, it gave the patient or his or her representative oral and written notice of the suspension of Medicare payment in a language and manner that the beneficiary or representative can understand.

        (2)  (i) The suspension of payment for all new admissions remedy may be imposed anytime a hospice program is found to be out of substantial compliance with the conditions of participation.

        (ii) The suspension of payment for all new admissions remains in place until CMS determines that the hospice program has achieved substantial compliance with the conditions of participation or is terminated, as determined by CMS.

        (3)  Payments for all new admissions to the hospice program resume prospectively on the date that CMS determines that the hospice program has achieved substantial compliance with the conditions of participation.

        (c)  The remedy in paragraph (a) of this section ends when any of the following occur—

        (1) CMS determines that the hospice program has achieved substantial compliance with all of the conditions of participation.

        (2) When the hospice program is terminated or CMS determines that the hospice program is not in compliance with the conditions of participation at a maximum of 6 months from the date of the survey identifying the noncompliance.

        § 488.1245   Civil money penalties.

#### § § 488.1245

        (a) (1) CMS may impose a civil money penalty against a hospice program for either the number of days the hospice program is not in compliance with one or more conditions of participation or for each instance that a hospice program is not in compliance, regardless of whether the hospice program's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (2) CMS may impose a civil money penalty for the number of days of immediate jeopardy.

        (3) A per-day and a per-instance civil money penalty (CMP) may not be imposed simultaneously for the same deficiency in conjunction with a survey.

        (4) CMS may impose a civil money penalty for the number of days of noncompliance since the last standard survey, including the number of days of immediate jeopardy.

        (b)—(1)  CMS takes into account the following factors in determining the amount of the penalty:

        (i) The factors set out at § 488.1215.

        (ii) The size of a hospice program and its resources.

        (iii) Evidence that the hospice program has a built-in, self-regulating quality assessment and performance improvement system to provide proper care, prevent poor outcomes, control patient injury, enhance quality, promote safety, and avoid risks to patients on a sustainable basis that indicates the ability to meet the conditions of participation and to ensure patient health and safety.

        (2)  Based on revisit survey findings, adjustments to penalties may be made after a review of the provider's attempted correction of deficiencies.

        (i) CMS may increase a CMP in increments based on a hospice program's inability or failure to correct deficiencies, the presence of a system-wide failure in the provision of quality care, or a determination of immediate jeopardy with actual harm versus immediate jeopardy with potential for harm.

        (ii) CMS may also decrease a CMP in increments to the extent that it finds, in accordance with a revisit, that substantial and sustainable improvements have been implemented even though the hospice program is not yet in compliance with the conditions of participation.

        (iii) No penalty assessment exceeds $10,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, for each day a hospice program is not in substantial compliance with one or more conditions of participation.

        (3)  Penalties in the upper range of $8,500 to $10,000 per day, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, are imposed for a condition-level deficiency that is immediate jeopardy. The penalty in this range continues until substantial compliance can be determined based on a revisit survey.

        (i) $10,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, per day for a deficiency or deficiencies that are immediate jeopardy and that result in actual harm.

        (ii) $9,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, per day for a deficiency or deficiencies that are immediate jeopardy and that result in a potential for harm.

        (iii) $8,500, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, per day for a deficiency based on an isolated incident in violation of established hospice policy.

        (4)  Penalties in the range of $1,500 up to $8,500, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, per day of noncompliance are imposed for a repeat or condition-level deficiency or both that does not constitute immediate jeopardy but is directly related to poor quality patient care outcomes.

        (5)  Penalties in this range of $500 to $4,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, are imposed for a repeat or condition-level deficiency or both that does not constitute immediate jeopardy and that are related predominately to structure or process-oriented conditions rather than directly related to patient care outcomes.

        (6)  Penalty imposed per instance of noncompliance may be assessed for one or more singular events of condition-level deficiency that are identified and where the noncompliance was corrected during the onsite survey. When penalties are imposed for per instance of noncompliance, or more than one per instance of noncompliance, the penalties will be in the range of $1,000 to $10,000 per instance, not to exceed $10,000 each day of noncompliance, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.

        (7)  If the immediate jeopardy situation is removed, but a condition-level deficiency exists, CMS shifts the penalty amount imposed per day from the upper range to the middle or lower range. An earnest effort to correct any systemic causes of deficiencies and sustain improvement must be evident.

        (8)  (i) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CMS increases the per day penalty amount for any condition-level deficiency or deficiencies which, after imposition of a lower-level penalty amount, become sufficiently serious to pose potential harm or immediate jeopardy.

        (ii) CMS increases the per day penalty amount for deficiencies that are not corrected and found again at the time of revisit survey(s) for which a lower-level penalty amount was previously imposed.

        (iii) CMS may impose a more severe amount of penalties for repeated noncompliance with the same condition-level deficiency or uncorrected deficiencies from a prior survey.

        (c) —(1)  CMS provides the hospice program with written notice of the intent to impose a civil money penalty in accordance with § 488.1210(e).

        (2) —(i)  A hospice program may request a hearing on the determination of the noncompliance that is the basis for imposition of the civil money penalty. The request must meet the requirements in § 498.40 of this chapter.

        (ii)  A hospice program may waive the right to a hearing, in writing, within 60 calendar days from the date of the notice imposing the civil money penalty. If a hospice program timely waives its right to a hearing, CMS reduces the penalty amount by 35 percent, and the amount is due within 15 calendar days of the hospice program agreeing in writing to waive the hearing. If the hospice program does not waive its right to a hearing in accordance to the procedures specified in this section, the civil money penalty is not reduced by 35 percent.

        (d) —(1)  (i) The per day civil money penalty may start accruing as early as the beginning of the last day of the survey that determines that the hospice program was out of compliance, as determined by CMS.

        (ii) A civil money penalty for each per instance of noncompliance is imposed in a specific amount for that particular deficiency, with a maximum of $10,000 per day per hospice program.

        (2)  (i) In the case of noncompliance that poses immediate jeopardy, CMS must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days after the last day of the survey if the immediate jeopardy is not removed.

        (ii) A penalty imposed per day of noncompliance will stop accruing on the day the provider agreement is terminated or the hospice program achieves substantial compliance, whichever occurs first.

        (3)  (i) In the case of noncompliance that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the daily accrual of per day civil money penalties is imposed for the days of noncompliance prior to the notice of intent specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and an additional period of no longer than 6 months following the last day of the survey.

        (ii) If the hospice program has not achieved compliance with the conditions of participation within 6 months following the last day of the survey, CMS terminates the provider agreement. The accrual of civil money penalty stops on the day the hospice program agreement is terminated or the hospice program achieves substantial compliance, whichever is earlier.

        (e)  (1) When a civil money penalty is imposed on a per day basis and the hospice program achieves compliance with the conditions of participation as determined by a revisit survey, once the administrative determination is final, CMS sends a final notice to the hospice program containing of the following information:

        (i) The amount of penalty assessed per day.

        (ii) The total number of days of noncompliance.

        (iii) The total amount due.

        (iv) The due date of the penalty.

        (v) The rate of interest to be assessed on any unpaid balance beginning on the due date, as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

        (2) When a civil money penalty is imposed per instance of noncompliance, once the administrative determination is final, CMS sends a final notice to the hospice program containing all of the following information:

        (i) The amount of the penalty that was assessed.

        (ii) The total amount due.

        (iii) The due date of the penalty.

        (iv) The rate of interest to be assessed on any unpaid balance beginning on the due date, as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

        (3) In the case of a hospice program for which the provider agreement has been involuntarily terminated, CMS sends the final notice after one of the following actions has occurred:

        (i) The administrative determination is final.

        (ii) The hospice program has waived its right to a hearing in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (iii) Time for requesting a hearing has expired and the hospice program has not requested a hearing.

        (f)  A penalty is due and payable 15 calendar days from notice of the final administrative decision.

        (1) Payments are due for all civil money penalties within 15 calendar days of any of the following:

        (i) After a final administrative decision when the hospice program achieves substantial compliance before the final decision or the effective date of termination occurs before the final decision.

        (ii) After the time to appeal has expired and the hospice program does not appeal or fails to timely appeal the initial determination.

        (iii) After CMS receives a written request from the hospice program requesting to waive its right to appeal the determinations that led to the imposition of a remedy.

        (iv) After the effective date of termination.

        (2) A request for hearing does not delay the imposition of any penalty; it only potentially delays the collection of the final penalty amount.

        (3) If a hospice program waives its right to a hearing according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, CMS applies a 35 percent reduction to the CMP amount for any of the following:

        (i) The hospice program achieved compliance with the conditions of participation before CMS received the written waiver of hearing.

        (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before CMS received the written waiver of hearing.

        (4) The period of noncompliance may not extend beyond 6 months from the last day of the survey.

        (5) The amount of the penalty, when determined, may be deducted (offset) from any sum then or later owing by CMS or State Medicaid to the hospice program.

        (6) Interest is assessed and accrues on the unpaid balance of a penalty, beginning on the due date. Interest is computed at the rate specified in § 405.378(d) of this chapter.

        (g) When an administrative law judge finds that the basis for imposing a civil monetary penalty exists, as specified in this part, the administrative law judge, may not do any of the following:

        (1) Set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero.

        (2) Review the exercise of discretion by CMS to impose a civil monetary penalty.

        (3) Consider any factors in reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 488.1250   Directed plan of correction.

#### § § 488.1250

        (a)  CMS may impose a directed plan of correction when a hospice program—

        (1) Has one or more condition-level deficiencies that warrant directing the hospice program to take specific actions; or

        (2) Fails to submit an acceptable plan of correction.

        (b)  (1) Before imposing the remedy in paragraph (a) of this section, CMS notifies the hospice program in accordance with § 488.1210(e).

        (2) Education is likely to correct the deficiencies.

        (3) The programs are conducted by established centers of health education and training or consultants with background in education and training with Medicare hospice providers, or as deemed acceptable by CMS or the State (by review of a copy of curriculum vitas or resumes and references to determine the educator's qualifications).

        (b) —(1)  Before imposing the remedy in paragraph (a) of this section, CMS notifies the hospice program in accordance with § 488.1210(e).

        § 489.13   Effective date of agreement or approval.

#### § § 489.13

        (a) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this section applies to Medicare provider agreements with, and supplier approval of, entities that, as a basis for participation in Medicare are subject to a determination by CMS on the basis of—

        (i) A survey conducted by the State survey agency or CMS surveyors; or

        (ii) In lieu of such State survey agency or CMS conducted survey, accreditation by an accreditation organization whose program has CMS approval in accordance with section 1865 of the Act at the time of the accreditation survey and accreditation decision.

        (2)  (i) For an agreement with a community mental health center (CMHC) or a federally qualified health center (FQHC), the effective date is the date on which CMS accepts a signed agreement which assures that the CMHC or FQHC meets all Federal requirements.

        (ii) A Medicare supplier approval of a laboratory is effective only while the laboratory has in effect a valid CLIA certificate issued under part 493 of this chapter, and only for the specialty and subspecialty tests it is authorized to perform.

        (iii) For an agreement with an opioid treatment program (OTP), the effective date is the effective date of billing as established under § 424.520(d) or § 424.521(a), as applicable.

        (b)  The agreement or approval is effective on the date the State agency, CMS, or the CMS contractor survey (including the Life Safety Code survey, if applicable) is completed, or on the effective date of the accreditation decision, as applicable, if on that date the provider or supplier meets all applicable Federal requirements as set forth in this chapter. (If the agreement or approval is time-limited, the new agreement or approval is effective on the day following the expiration of the current agreement or approval.) However, the effective date of the agreement or approval may not be earlier than the latest of the dates on which CMS determines that each applicable Federal requirement is met. Federal requirements include, but are not limited to—

        (1) Enrollment requirements established in part 424, subpart P, of this chapter. CMS determines, based upon its review and verification of the prospective provider's or supplier's enrollment application, the date on which enrollment requirements have been met;

        (2) The requirements identified in §§ 489.10 and 489.12; and

        (3) The applicable Medicare health and safety standards, such as the applicable conditions of participation, the requirements for participation, the conditions for coverage, or the conditions for certification.

        (c)  If, on the date the survey is completed, the provider or supplier has failed to meet any one of the applicable health and safety standards, the following rules apply for determining the effective date of the provider agreement or supplier approval, assuming that no other Federal requirements remain to be satisfied. However, if other Federal requirements remain to be satisfied, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the effective date of the agreement or approval may not be earlier than the latest of the dates on which CMS determines that each applicable Federal requirement is met.

        (1) For an agreement with an SNF, the effective date is the date on which—

        (i) The SNF is in substantial compliance (as defined in § 488.301 of this chapter) with the requirements for participation; and

        (ii) CMS or the State survey agency receives from the SNF, if applicable, an approvable waiver request.

        (2) For an agreement with, or an approval of, any other provider or supplier, (except those specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the effective date is the earlier of the following:

        (i) The date on which the provider or supplier meets all applicable conditions of participation, conditions for coverage, or conditions for certification; or, if applicable, the date of a CMS-approved accreditation organization program's positive accreditation decision, issued after the accreditation organization has determined that the provider or supplier meets all applicable conditions.

        (ii) The date on which a provider or supplier is found to meet all conditions of participation, conditions for coverage, or conditions for certification, but has lower-level deficiencies, and—

        (A) CMS or the State survey agency receives an acceptable plan of correction for the lower-level deficiencies (the date of receipt is the effective date regardless of when the plan of correction is approved); or, if applicable, a CMS-approved accreditation organization program issues a positive accreditation decision after it receives an acceptable plan of correction for the lower-level deficiencies; or

        (B) CMS receives an approvable waiver request (the date of receipt is the effective date regardless of when CMS approves the waiver request).

        (3) For an agreement with any other provider or an approval of any other supplier (except those specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) that is found to meet all conditions of participation, conditions for coverage, or conditions for certification, but has lower-level deficiencies and has submitted both an approvable plan of correction/positive accreditation decision and an approvable waiver request, the effective date is the later of the dates that result when calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

        § 489.18   Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider agreement.

#### § § 489.18

        (a) —(1)  In the case of a partnership, the removal, addition, or substitution of a partner, unless the partners expressly agree otherwise, as permitted by applicable State law, constitutes change of ownership.

        (2)  Transfer of title and property to another party constitutes change of ownership.

        (3)  The merger of the provider corporation into another corporation, or the consolidation of two or more corporations, resulting in the creation of a new corporation constitutes change of ownership. Transfer of corporate stock or the merger of another corporation into the provider corporation does not constitute change of ownership.

        (4)  The lease of all or part of a provider facility constitutes change of ownership of the leased portion.

        (b)  A provider who is contemplating or negotiating a change of ownership must notify CMS.

        (d)  An assigned agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and regulations and to the terms and conditions under which it was originally issued including, but not limited to, the following:

        (1) Any existing plan of correction.

The notice should disclose, in a manner reasonably designed to be understood by all patients, the fact that the hospital meets the Federal definition of a physician-owned hospital specified in § 489.3 and that the list of the hospital's owners or investors who are physicians or immediate family members (as defined at § 411.351 of this chapter) of physicians is available upon request and must be provided to the patient at the time the request for the list is made by or on behalf of the patient. For purposes of this paragraph (u)(1), the hospital stay or outpatient visit begins with the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or an outpatient service.

        (2) To require each physician who is a member of the hospital's medical staff to agree, as a condition of continued medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose, in writing, to all patients the physician refers to the hospital any ownership or investment interest in the hospital that is held by the physician or by an immediate family member (as defined at § 411.351 of this chapter) of the physician.

        (v) The requirements of paragraph (u) of this section do not apply to any physician-owned hospital that does not have at least one referring physician (as defined at § 411.351 of this chapter) who has an ownership or investment interest in the hospital or who has an immediate family member who has an ownership or investment interest in the hospital, provided that such hospital signs an attestation statement to that effect and maintains such attestation in its records.

        (w)(1) In the case of a hospital as defined in § 489.24(b), to furnish written notice to all patients at the beginning of their planned or unplanned inpatient hospital stay or at the beginning of any planned or unplanned outpatient visit for observation, surgery or any other procedure requiring anesthesia, if a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy is not present in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, in order to assist the patients in making informed decisions regarding their care, in accordance with § 482.13(b)(2) of this subchapter. For purposes of this paragraph, a planned hospital stay or outpatient visit begins with the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or outpatient service.

        (2) In the case of a hospital that is a main provider and has one or more remote locations of a hospital or one or more satellites, as these terms are defined in § 413.65(a)(2), § 412.22(h), or § 412.25(e) of this chapter, as applicable, the determination is made separately for the main provider and each remote location or satellite whether notice to patients is required. Notice is required at each location at which inpatient services are furnished at which a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy is not present 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

        (3) The written notice must state that the hospital does not have a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and must indicate how the hospital will meet the medical needs of any patient who develops an emergency medical condition, as defined in § 489.24(b), at a time when there is no doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital.

        (4) Before admitting a patient or providing an outpatient service to outpatients for whom a notice is required, the hospital must receive a signed acknowledgment from the patient stating that the patient understands that a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy may not be present during all hours services are furnished to the patient.

        (5) Each dedicated emergency department, as that term is defined in § 489.24(b), in a hospital in which a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy is not present 24 hours per day, 7 days per week must post a notice conspicuously in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the dedicated emergency department. The posted notice must state that the hospital does not have a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and must indicate how the hospital will meet the medical needs of any patient with an emergency medical condition, as defined in § 489.24(b), at a time when there is no doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital.

        (y) In the case of a hospital or critical access hospital, to provide notice, as specified in paragraphs (y)(1) and (2) of this section, to each individual entitled to Medicare benefits under Title XVIII of the Act when such individual receives observation services as an outpatient for more than 24 hours. Notice must be provided to the individual not later than 36 hours after observation services are initiated or sooner if the individual is transferred, discharged, or admitted. Notice may be provided before such individual receives 24 hours of observation services as an outpatient.

        (1)  Hospitals and critical access hospitals must use a standardized written notice, as specified by the Secretary, which includes the following information:

        (i) An explanation of the status of the individual as an outpatient receiving observation services and not as an inpatient of the hospital or critical access hospital and the reason for status as an outpatient receiving observation services; and

        (ii) An explanation of the implications of such status as an outpatient on services furnished by the hospital or critical access hospital (including services furnished on an inpatient basis), such as Medicare cost-sharing requirements, and subsequent eligibility for Medicare coverage for skilled nursing facility services.

        (2)  The hospital must give an oral explanation of the written notification described in paragraph (y)(1) of this section.

        (3)  The written notice specified in paragraph (y)(1) of this section must either—

        (i) Be signed by the individual who receives observation services as an outpatient or a person acting on the individual's behalf to acknowledge receipt of such notification; or

        (ii) If the individual who receives observation services as an outpatient or the person acting on behalf of the individual refuses to provide the signature described in paragraph (y)(1) of this section, is signed by the staff member of the hospital or critical access hospital who presented the written notification and includes the name and title of the staff member, a certification that the notification was presented, and the date and time the notification was presented.

For this purpose, a charge by another provider or supplier for such an item or service is treated as a charge by the hospital for the item or service, and is also prohibited.

        (g) [Reserved]

        (h) Items and services (other than those described in § 489.20(s)(1) through (15)) required to be furnished under § 489.20(s) to a resident of an SNF (defined in § 411.15(p) of this chapter), for which Medicare payment would be made if furnished by the SNF or by other providers or suppliers under arrangements made with them by the SNF. For this purpose, a charge by another provider or supplier for such an item or service is treated as a charge by the SNF for the item or service, and is also prohibited.

        (c) A provider may not evict, or threaten to evict, an individual for inability to pay a deductible or a coinsurance amount required under Medicare.

        (d) A provider may not charge an individual for (1) its agreement to admit or readmit the individual on some specified future date for covered inpatient services; or (2) for failure to remain an inpatient for any agreed-upon length of time or for failure to give advance notice of departure from the provider's facilities.

        § 489.23   Specific limitation on charges for services provided to certain enrollees of fee-for-service FEHB plans.

#### § § 489.23

        A provider that furnishes inpatient hospital services to a retired Federal worker age 65 or older who is enrolled in a fee-for-service FEHB plan and who is not covered under Medicare Part A, must accept, as payment in full, an amount that approximates as closely as possible the Medicare inpatient hospital prospective payment system (PPS) rate established under part 412. The payment to the provider is composed of a payment from the FEHB plan and a payment from the enrollee. This combined payment approximates the Medicare PPS rate. The payment from the FEHB plan approximates, as closely as possible, the Medicare PPS rate minus any applicable enrollee deductible, coinsurance, or copayment amount. The payment from the enrollee is equal to the applicable deductible, coinsurance, or copayment amount.

        § 489.24   Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases.

#### § § 489.24

        (a)  (1) In the case of a hospital that has an emergency department, if an individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare benefits and regardless of ability to pay) “comes to the emergency department”, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the hospital must—

        (i) Provide an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists. The examination must be conducted by an individual(s) who is determined qualified by hospital bylaws or rules and regulations and who meets the requirements of § 482.55 of this chapter concerning emergency services personnel and direction; and

        (ii) If an emergency medical condition is determined to exist, provide any necessary stabilizing treatment, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, or an appropriate transfer as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. If the hospital admits the individual as an inpatient for further treatment, the hospital's obligation under this section ends, as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (2)(i) When a waiver has been issued in accordance with section 1135 of the Act that includes a waiver under section 1135(b)(3) of the Act, sanctions under this section for an inappropriate transfer or for the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening at an alternate location do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated emergency department if the following conditions are met:

        (A) The transfer is necessitated by the circumstances of the declared emergency in the emergency area during the emergency period.

        (B) The direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening at an alternate location is pursuant to an appropriate State emergency preparedness plan or, in the case of a public health emergency that involves a pandemic infectious disease, pursuant to a State pandemic preparedness plan.

        (C) The hospital does not discriminate on the basis of an individual's source of payment or ability to pay.

        (D) The hospital is located in an emergency area during an emergency period, as those terms are defined in section 1135(g)(1) of the Act.

        (E) There has been a determination that a waiver of sanctions is necessary.

        (ii) A waiver of these sanctions is limited to a 72-hour period beginning upon the implementation of a hospital disaster protocol, except that, if a public health emergency involves a pandemic infectious disease (such as pandemic influenza), the waiver will continue in effect until the termination of the applicable declaration of a public health emergency, as provided under section 1135(e)(1)(B) of the Act.

        (b)  As used in this subpart—

        means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred individual. _Capacity_ encompasses such things as numbers and availability of qualified staff, beds and equipment and the hospital's past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.

        means, with respect to an individual who is not a patient (as defined in this section), the individual—

        (1) Has presented at a hospital's dedicated emergency department, as defined in this section, and requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, or has such a request made on his or her behalf. In the absence of such a request by or on behalf of the individual, a request on behalf of the individual will be considered to exist if a prudent layperson observer would believe, based on the individual's appearance or behavior, that the individual needs examination or treatment for a medical condition;

        (2) Has presented on hospital property, as defined in this section, other than the dedicated emergency department, and requests examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition, or has such a request made on his or her behalf. In the absence of such a request by or on behalf of the individual, a request on behalf of the individual will be considered to exist if a prudent layperson observer would believe, based on the individual's appearance or behavior, that the individual needs emergency examination or treatment;

        (3) Is in a ground or air ambulance owned and operated by the hospital for purposes of examination and treatment for a medical condition at a hospital's dedicated emergency department, even if the ambulance is not on hospital grounds. However, an individual in an ambulance owned and operated by the hospital is not considered to have “come to the hospital's emergency department” if—

        (i) The ambulance is operated under communitywide emergency medical service (EMS) protocols that direct it to transport the individual to a hospital other than the hospital that owns the ambulance; for example, to the closest appropriate facility. In this case, the individual is considered to have come to the emergency department of the hospital to which the individual is transported, at the time the individual is brought onto hospital property;

        (ii) The ambulance is operated at the direction of a physician who is not employed or otherwise affiliated with the hospital that owns the ambulance; or

        (4) Is in a ground or air nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at a hospital's dedicated emergency department. However, an individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment. The hospital may direct the ambulance to another facility if it is in “diversionary status,” that is, it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, however, the ambulance staff disregards the hospital's diversion instructions and transports the individual onto hospital property, the individual is considered to have come to the emergency department.

        means any department or facility of the hospital, regardless of whether it is located on or off the main hospital campus, that meets at least one of the following requirements:

        (1) It is licensed by the State in which it is located under applicable State law as an emergency room or emergency department;

        (2) It is held out to the public (by name, posted signs, advertising, or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or

        (3) During the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a determination under this section is being made, based on a representative sample of patient visits that occurred during that calendar year, it provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.

        means—

        (1) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in—

        (i) Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy;

        (ii) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or

        (iii) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or

        (2) With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions—

        (i) That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery; or

        (ii) That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child.

        includes a critical access hospital as defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act and a rural emergency hospital as defined in section 1861(kkk)(2).

        means the entire main hospital campus as defined in § 413.65(b) of this chapter, including the parking lot, sidewalk, and driveway, but excluding other areas or structures of the hospital's main building that are not part of the hospital, such as physician offices, rural health centers, skilled nursing facilities, or other entities that participate separately under Medicare, or restaurants, shops, or other nonmedical facilities.

        means a hospital with a dedicated emergency department as defined in this paragraph (b).

        means an individual who is admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services as described in § 409.10(a) of this chapter with the expectation that he or she will remain at least overnight and occupy a bed even though the situation later develops that the individual can be discharged or transferred to another hospital and does not actually use a hospital bed overnight.

        means the process of childbirth beginning with the latent or early phase of labor and continuing through the delivery of the placenta. A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other qualified medical person acting within his or her scope of practice as defined in hospital medical staff bylaws and State law, certifies that, after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor.

        means:

        (i) A hospital;

        (ii) A critical access hospital as defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act that has entered into a Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the Act; or

        (iii) A rural emergency hospital as defined in section 1861(kkk)(2) of the Act.

        means—

        (1) An individual who has begun to receive outpatient services as part of an encounter, as defined in § 410.2 of this chapter, other than an encounter that the hospital is obligated by this section to provide;

        (2) An individual who has been admitted as an inpatient, as defined in this section.

        means, with respect to an “emergency medical condition” as defined in this section under paragraph (1) of that definition, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility or, with respect to an “emergency medical condition” as defined in this section under paragraph (2) of that definition, that the woman has delivered the child and the placenta.

        means, with respect to an “emergency medical condition” as defined in this section under paragraph (1) of that definition, to provide such medical treatment of the condition necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility or that, with respect to an “emergency medical condition” as defined in this section under paragraph (2) of that definition, the woman has delivered the child and the placenta.

        means the movement (including the discharge) of an individual outside a hospital's facilities at the direction of any person employed by (or affiliated or associated, directly or indirectly, with) the hospital, but does not include such a movement of an individual who (i) has been declared dead, or (ii) leaves the facility without the permission of any such person.

        (c)  If an individual comes to a hospital's dedicated emergency department and a request is made on his or her behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for any individual presenting in that manner, to determine that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition.

        (d) —(1)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare benefits) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either—

        (i) Within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for further medical examination and treatment as required to stabilize the medical condition.

        (ii) For transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (2)  (i) If a hospital has screened an individual under paragraph (a) of this section and found the individual to have an emergency medical condition, and admits that individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition, the hospital has satisfied its special responsibilities under this section with respect to that individual.

        (ii) This section is not applicable to an inpatient who was admitted for elective (nonemergency) diagnosis or treatment.

        (iii) A hospital is required by the conditions of participation for hospitals under part 482 of this chapter to provide care to its inpatients in accordance with those conditions of participation.

        (3)  A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital offers the individual the further medical examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the examination and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not consent to the examination or treatment. The medical record must contain a description of the examination, treatment, or both if applicable, that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of the person acting on his or her behalf). The written document should indicate that the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the examination or treatment, or both.

        (4)  (i) A participating hospital may not delay providing an appropriate medical screening examination required under paragraph (a) of this section or further medical examination and treatment required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status.

        (ii) A participating hospital may not seek, or direct an individual to seek, authorization from the individual's insurance company for screening or stabilization services to be furnished by a hospital, physician, or nonphysician practitioner to an individual until after the hospital has provided the appropriate medical screening examination required under paragraph (a) of this section, and initiated any further medical examination and treatment that may be required to stabilize the emergency medical condition under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (iii) An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not precluded from contacting the individual's physician at any time to seek advice regarding the individual's medical history and needs that may be relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required under paragraph (a) or paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

        (iv) Hospitals may follow reasonable registration processes for individuals for whom examination or treatment is required by this section, including asking whether an individual is insured and, if so, what that insurance is, as long as that inquiry does not delay screening or treatment. Reasonable registration processes may not unduly discourage individuals from remaining for further evaluation.

        (5)  A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital offers to transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not consent to the transfer. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and state the reasons for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a description of the proposed transfer that was refused by or on behalf of the individual.

        (e) —(1)  If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless—

        (i) The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section); and

        (ii)(A) The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer, after being informed of the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of transfer. The request must be in writing and indicate the reasons for the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer;

        (B) A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) has signed a certification that, based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based; or

        (C) If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical person (as determined by the hospital in its by-laws or rules and regulations) has signed a certification described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) in consultation with the qualified medical person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns the certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based.

        (2) A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only in those cases in which—

        (i) The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;

        (ii) The receiving facility—

        (A) Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual; and

        (B) Has agreed to accept transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment;

        (iii) The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) related to the emergency condition which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the transfer, including available history, records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided, results of any tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy thereof) required under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, and the name and address of any on-call physician (described in paragraph (g) of this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records (e.g., test results not yet available or historical records not readily available from the hospital's files) must be sent as soon as practicable after transfer; and

        (iv) The transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer.

        (3) A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical person refuses to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against any hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this section.

        (f)  A participating hospital that has specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma units, neonatal intensive case units, or, with respect to rural areas, regional referral centers (which, for purposes of this subpart, mean hospitals meeting the requirements of referral centers found at § 412.96 of this chapter)) may not refuse to accept from a referring hospital within the boundaries of the United States an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the receiving hospital has the capacity to treat the individual.

        (1) The provisions of this paragraph (f) apply to any participating hospital with specialized capabilities, regardless of whether the hospital has a dedicated emergency department.

        (2) The provisions of this paragraph (f) do not apply to an individual who has been admitted to a referring hospital under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (g)  If a hospital fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) through (f) of this section, CMS may terminate the provider agreement in accordance with § 489.53.

        (h) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, in cases where a medical opinion is necessary to determine a physician's or hospital's liability under section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, CMS requests the appropriate QIO (with a contract under Part B of title XI of the Act) to review the alleged section 1867(d) violation and provide a report on its findings in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section. CMS provides to the QIO all information relevant to the case and within its possession or control. CMS, in consultation with the OIG, also provides to the QIO a list of relevant questions to which the QIO must respond in its report.

        (2)  The QIO shall provide the physician and hospital reasonable notice of its review, a reasonable opportunity for discussion, and an opportunity for the physician and hospital to submit additional information before issuing its report. When a QIO receives a request for consultation under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the following provisions apply—

        (i) The QIO reviews the case before the 15th calendar day and makes its tentative findings.

        (ii) Within 15 calendar days of receiving the case, the QIO gives written notice, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the physician or the hospital (or both if applicable).

        (iii)(A) The written notice must contain the following information:

        () The name of each individual who may have been the subject of the alleged violation.

        () The date on which each alleged violation occurred.

        () An invitation to meet, either by telephone or in person, to discuss the case with the QIO, and to submit additional information to the QIO within _3_0 calendar days of receipt of the notice, and a statement that these rights will be waived if the invitation is not accepted. The QIO must receive the information and hold the meeting within the 30-day period.

        () A copy of the regulations at _4_2 CFR 489.24.

        (B) For purposes of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the date of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the certified mail date on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.

        (iv) The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may request a meeting with the QIO. This meeting is not designed to be a formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician or hospital. The meeting is intended to afford the physician and/or the hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the physician and/or hospital regarding the case. The following provisions apply to that meeting:

        (A) The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal counsel present during that meeting. However, the QIO may control the scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation by the attorney. The QIO may also have legal counsel present.

        (B) The QIO makes arrangements so that, if requested by CMS or the OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated. If CMS or OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected hospital may request that CMS provide a copy of the transcript.

        (C) The QIO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert testimony in either oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the QIO may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and length of such testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician and/or hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient records to potential expert witnesses without violating any non-disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter.

        (D) The QIO is not obligated to consider any additional information provided by the physician and/or the hospital after the meeting, unless, before the end of the meeting, the QIO requests that the physician and/or hospital submit additional information to support the claims. The QIO then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional period of time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the relevant information to the QIO.

        (v) Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the QIO must submit to CMS a report on the QIO's findings. CMS provides copies to the OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The report must contain the name of the physician and/or the hospital, the name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived at and was transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report provides expert medical opinion regarding whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition, whether the individual's emergency medical condition was stabilized, whether the individual was transferred appropriately, and whether there were any medical utilization or quality of care issues involved in the case.

        (vi) The report required under paragraph (h)(2)(v) of this section should not state an opinion or conclusion as to whether section 1867 of the Act or § 489.24 has been violated.

        (3) If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was no screening examination, the QIO review described in this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties or an exclusion in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title.

        (4) If the QIO determines after a preliminary review that there was an appropriate medical screening examination and the individual did not have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, then the QIO may, at its discretion, return the case to CMS and not meet the requirements of paragraph (h) except for those in paragraph (h)(2)(v).

        (i)  Upon request, CMS may release a QIO assessment to the physician and/or hospital, or the affected individual, or his or her representative. The QIO physician's identity is confidential unless he or she consents to its release. (See §§ 476.132 and 476.133 of this chapter.)

        (j)  In accordance with the on-call list requirements specified in § 489.20(r)(2), a hospital must have written policies and procedures in place—

        (1) To respond to situations in which a particular specialty is not available or the on-call physician cannot respond because of circumstances beyond the physician's control; and

        (2) To provide that emergency services are available to meet the needs of individuals with emergency medical conditions if a hospital elects to—

        (i) Permit on-call physicians to schedule elective surgery during the time that they are on call;

        (ii) Permit on-call physicians to have simultaneous on-call duties; and

        (iii) Participate in a formal community call plan. Notwithstanding participation in a community call plan, hospitals are still required to perform medical screening examinations on individuals who present seeking treatment and to conduct appropriate transfers. The formal community plan must include the following elements:

        (A) A clear delineation of on-call coverage responsibilities; that is, when each hospital participating in the plan is responsible for on-call coverage.

        (B) A description of the specific geographic area to which the plan applies.

        (C) A signature by an appropriate representative of each hospital participating in the plan.

        (D) Assurances that any local and regional EMS system protocol formally includes information on community on-call arrangements.

        (E) A statement specifying that even if an individual arrives at a hospital that is not designated as the on-call hospital, that hospital still has an obligation under § 489.24 to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment within its capability, and that hospitals participating in the community call plan must abide by the regulations under § 489.24 governing appropriate transfers.

        (F) An annual assessment of the community call plan by the participating hospitals.

        § 489.27   Beneficiary notice of discharge or change in status rights.

#### § § 489.27

        (a) A hospital that participates in the Medicare program must furnish each Medicare beneficiary or enrollee, (or an individual acting on his or her behalf), timely notice as required by section 1866(A)(1)(M) of the Act and in accordance with § 405.1205 and § 422.620. The hospital must be able to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.

        (b)  Hospitals and other providers (as identified at § 489.2(b)) that participate in the Medicare program must furnish each Medicare beneficiary, or representative, applicable CMS notices in advance of discharge or termination of Medicare services, or of changes from inpatient to outpatient status, including the notices required under §§ 405.1200, 405.1202, 405.1206, 405.1210, and 422.624 of this chapter.

        § 489.28   Special capitalization requirements for HHAs.

#### § § 489.28

        (a)  An HHA entering the Medicare program on or after January 1, 1998, including a new HHA as a result of a change of ownership, if the change of ownership results in a new provider number being issued, must have available sufficient funds, which we term “initial reserve operating funds,” at the time of application submission and at all times during the enrollment process up to the expiration of the 3-month period following the conveyance of Medicare billing privileges to operate the HHA for the three-month period after Medicare billing privileges are conveyed by the Medicare contractor, exclusive of actual or projected accounts receivable from Medicare.

        (b)  Initial reserve operating funds are sufficient to meet the requirement of this section if the total amount of such funds is equal to or greater than the product of the actual average cost per visit of three or more similarly situated HHAs in their first year of operation (selected by CMS for comparative purposes) multiplied by the number of visits projected by the HHA for its first three months of operation—or 22.5 percent (one fourth of 90 percent) of the average number of visits reported by the comparison HHAs—whichever is greater.

        (c)  CMS, through the intermediary, will determine the amount of the initial reserve operating funds using reported cost and visit data from submitted cost reports for the first full year of operation from at least three HHAs that the intermediary serves that are comparable to the HHA that is seeking to enter the Medicare program, considering such factors as geographic location and urban/rural status, number of visits, provider-based versus free-standing, and proprietary versus non-proprietary status. The determination of the adequacy of the required initial reserve operating funds is based on the average cost per visit of the comparable HHAs, by dividing the sum of total reported costs of the HHAs in their first year of operation by the sum of the HHAs' total reported visits. The resulting average cost per visit is then multiplied by the projected visits for the first three months of operation of the HHA seeking to enter the program, but not less than 90 percent of average visits for a three month period for the HHAs used in determining the average cost per visit.

        (1) In selecting the comparative HHAs as described in this paragraph (c), the CMS contractor shall only select HHAs that have provided cost reports to Medicare. When selecting cost reports for the comparative analysis, CMS will exclude low utilization or no utilization cost reports.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (d)  The HHA must provide CMS with adequate proof of the availability of initial reserve operating funds. Such proof, at a minimum, will include a copy of the statement(s) of the HHA's savings, checking, or other account(s) that contains the funds, accompanied by an attestation from an officer of the bank or other financial institution (if the financial institution offers such attestations) that the funds are in the account(s) and that the funds are immediately available to the HHA. In some cases, an HHA may have all or part of the initial reserve operating funds in cash equivalents. For the purpose of this section, cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that present insignificant risk of changes in value. A cash equivalent that is not readily convertible to a known amount of cash as needed during the initial 3-month period for which the initial reserve operating funds are required does not qualify in meeting the initial reserve operating funds requirement. Examples of cash equivalents for the purpose of this section are Treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds. As with funds in a checking, savings, or other account, the HHA also must be able to document the availability of any cash equivalents. CMS later may require the HHA to furnish another attestation from the financial institution that the funds remain available, or, if applicable, documentation from the HHA that any cash equivalents remain available, until a date when the HHA will have been surveyed by the State agency or by an approved accrediting organization. The officer of the HHA who will be certifying the accuracy of the information on the HHA's cost report must certify what portion of the required initial reserve operating funds is non-borrowed funds, including funds invested in the business by the owner. That amount must be at least 50 percent of the required initial reserve operating funds. The remainder of the reserve operating funds may be secured through borrowing or line of credit from an unrelated lender.

        (e)  If borrowed funds are not in the same account(s) as the HHA's own non-borrowed funds, the HHA also must provide proof that the borrowed funds are available for use in operating the HHA, by providing, at a minimum, a copy of the statement(s) of the HHA's savings, checking, or other account(s) containing the borrowed funds, accompanied by an attestation from an officer of the bank or other financial institution (if the financial institution offers such attestations) that the funds are in the account(s) and are immediately available to the HHA. As with the HHA's own (that is, non-borrowed) funds, CMS later may require the HHA to establish the current availability of such borrowed funds, including furnishing an attestation from a financial institution or other source, as may be appropriate, and to establish that such funds will remain available until a date when the HHA will have been surveyed by the State agency or by an approved accrediting organization.

        (f)  If the HHA chooses to support the availability of a portion of the initial reserve operating funds with a line of credit, it must provide CMS with a letter of credit from the lender. CMS later may require the HHA to furnish an attestation from the lender that the HHA, upon its certification into the Medicare program, continues to be approved to borrow the amount specified in the letter of credit.

        (g)  (1) CMS may deny Medicare billing privileges to an HHA unless the HHA meets the initial reserve operating funds requirements of this section.

        (2) CMS may revoke the Medicare billing privileges of an HHA that fails to maintain and comply with the initial reserve operating funds requirements of this section for the three-month period after it receives its Medicare billing privileges.

        (2) For hospital outpatient services, the allowable deductible charges depend on whether the hospital can determine the beneficiary's deductible status.

        (i) If the hospital is unable to determine the deductible status, it may charge the beneficiary its full customary charges up to $75.

        (ii) If the beneficiary provides official information as to deductible status, the hospital may charge only the unmet portion of the deductible.

        (3) In either of the cases discussed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the hospital is required to file with the intermediary, on a form prescribed by CMS, information as to the services, charges, and amounts collected.

        (4) The intermediary must reimburse the beneficiary if reimbursement is authorized and credit the expenses to the beneficiary's deductible if the deductible has not yet been met.

        (5) In the case of DME furnished as a home health service under Medicare Part B, the coinsurance is 20 percent of the customary (insofar as reasonable) charge for the services, with the following exception: If the DME is used DME purchased by or on behalf of the beneficiary at a price at least 25 percent less than the reasonable charge for comparable new equipment, no coinsurance is required.

        (6) In the case of a rebatable drug (as defined in section 1847A(i)(2)(A) of the Act), including a selected drug (as defined in section 1192(c) of the Act), furnished on or after April 1, 2023, in a calendar quarter in which the payment amount for such drug as specified in section 1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii)(I)(aa) or (bb), as applicable, exceeds the inflation-adjusted amount (as defined in section 1847A(i)(3)(C) of the Act) for such drug, the basic allowable charges are the Part B annual deductible and 20 percent of the inflation-adjusted payment amount for the rebatable drug in excess of that deductible, which is applied as a percent to the payment amount for such calendar quarter.

        (7) In the case of insulin furnished on or after July 1, 2023 through an item of durable medical equipment covered under section 1861(n) of the Act, the coinsurance amount shall not exceed $35 for a month's supply of such insulin each calendar month. This limitation on the coinsurance amount shall apply for the duration of the calendar month in which the date of service (or services) occurs. In addition, the coinsurance amount shall not exceed $105.00 for 3 months' supply of insulin. This limitation on the coinsurance amount shall apply for the duration of the calendar month in which the date of service (or services) occurs and the 2 following calendar months.

#### § § 489.41

        (a)  Prompt refund to the beneficiary or other person is the preferred method of handling incorrect collections.

        (b)  If the provider cannot refund within 60 days from the date on the notice of incorrect collection, it must set aside an amount, equal to the amount incorrectly collected, in a separate account identified as to the individual to whom the payment is due. This amount incorrectly collected must be carried on the provider's records in this manner until final disposition is made in accordance with the applicable State law.

        (c)  (1) The provider must notify the intermediary of the refund or setting aside required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

#### § § 489.42

        (a) In order to carry out the commitment to refund amounts incorrectly collected, CMS may determine that amounts offset in accordance with § 489.41 are to be paid directly to the beneficiary or other person from whom the provider received the incorrect collection, if:

        (1) CMS finds that the provider has failed, following written request, to refund the amount of the incorrect collection to the beneficiary or other person; and

        (2) The provider agreement has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of subpart E of this part.

        (c) The notice will afford an authorized official of the provider an opportunity to submit, within 20 days from the date on the notice, written statement or evidence with respect to the incorrect collection and/or offset amounts. CMS will consider any written statement or evidence in making a determination.

        (d) Payment to a beneficiary or other person under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) Will not exceed the amount of the incorrect collection; and

        (2) May be considered as payment made to the provider.

        (2) CMS may accept a termination date that is less than 6 months after the date on the provider's notice if it determines that to do so would not unduly disrupt services to the community or otherwise interfere with the effective and efficient administration of the Medicare program.

        (3) A cessation of business is deemed to be a termination by the provider, effective with the date on which it stopped providing services to the community.

        (4) A provider may request a retroactive termination date if no Medicare beneficiary received services from the facility on or after the requested termination date.

        (c)  (1) The provider must give notice to the public at least 15 days before the effective date of termination.

        (2) The notice must—

        (3) It no longer meets the appropriate conditions of participation or requirements (for SNFs and NFs) set forth elsewhere in this chapter. In the case of an RNHCI, it no longer meets the conditions for coverage, conditions of participation and requirements set forth elsewhere in this chapter. In the case of an OTP, it no longer meets the requirements set forth in this section and elsewhere in this chapter.

        (4) It fails to furnish information that CMS finds necessary for a determination as to whether payments are or were due under Medicare and the amounts due.

        (5) It refuses to permit examination of its fiscal or other records by, or on behalf of CMS, as necessary for verification of information furnished as a basis for payment under Medicare.

        (6) It failed to furnish information on business transactions as required in § 420.205 of this chapter.

        (7) It failed at the time the agreement was entered into or renewed to disclose information on convicted individuals as required in § 420.204 of this chapter.

        § 489.54   Termination by the OIG.

#### § § 489.54

        (a)  (1) The OIG may terminate the agreement of any provider if the OIG finds that any of the following failings can be attributed to that provider.

        (i) It has knowingly and willfully made, or caused to be made, any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in an application or request for payment under Medicare.

        (ii) It has submitted, or caused to be submitted, requests for Medicare payment of amounts that substantially exceed the costs it incurred in furnishing the services for which payment is requested.

        (iii) It has furnished services that the OIG has determined to be substantially in excess of the needs of individuals or of a quality that fails to meet professionally recognized standards of health care. The OIG will not terminate a provider agreement under paragraph (a) if CMS has waived a disallowance with respect to the services in question on the grounds that the provider and the beneficiary could not reasonably be expected to know that payment would not be made. (The rules for determining such lack of knowledge are set forth in §§ 405.330 through 405.334 of this chapter.)

        (b)  The OIG will give the provider notice of termination at least 15 days before the effective date of termination of the agreement, and will concurrently give notice of termination to the public.

        (c)  A provider may appeal a termination of its agreement by the OIG in accordance with subpart O of part 405 of this chapter.

      Subpart F—Surety Bond Requirements for HHAs

**Source:** Source: 63 FR 313, Jan. 5, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

        § 489.60   Definitions.

#### § § 489.60

        As used in this subpart unless the context indicates otherwise—

        means a sum certain that CMS may assess against an HHA in lieu of damages under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI of the Social Security Act or under regulations in this chapter.

        includes but is not limited to any listing that identifies Medicare beneficiaries to whom home health services were furnished by a participating or formerly participating HHA.

        means a sum certain that CMS has the authority to impose on an HHA as a penalty under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI of the Social Security Act or under regulations in this chapter.

        means a “home health agency” (HHA), as that term is defined by section 1861(o) of the Social Security Act, that also meets the definition of a “provider” set forth at § 400.202 of this chapter.

        means a notice issued by a Surety that a change in the bond has occurred or will occur.

        means one or more bonds issued by one or more surety companies under 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225, provided the bond otherwise meets the requirements of this section.

        means a civil money penalty or assessment imposed by CMS on an HHA under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI of the Social Security Act, plus accrued interest, that, after the HHA or Surety has exhausted all administrative appeals, remains unpaid (because the civil money penalty or assessment has not been paid to, or offset or compromised by, CMS) and is not the subject of a written arrangement, acceptable to CMS, for payment by the HHA. In the event a written arrangement for payment, acceptable to CMS, is made, an  also means such civil money penalty or assessment, plus accrued interest, that remains due 60 days after the HHA's default on such arrangement.

        means a Medicare overpayment for which the HHA is responsible, plus accrued interest, that, 90 days after the date of the agency's notice to the HHA of the overpayment, remains due (because the overpayment has not been paid to, or recouped or compromised by, CMS) and is not the subject of a written arrangement, acceptable to CMS, for payment by the HHA. In the event a written arrangement for payment, acceptable to CMS, is made, an  also means a Medicare overpayment for which the HHA is responsible, plus accrued interest, that remains due 60 days after the HHA's default on such arrangement.

        § 489.61   Basic requirement for surety bonds.

#### § § 489.61

        Except as provided in § 489.62, each HHA that is a Medicare participating HHA, or that seeks to become a Medicare participating HHA, must obtain a surety bond (and furnish to CMS a copy of such surety bond) that meets the requirements of this subpart F and CMS's instructions.

        § 489.62   Requirement waived for Government-operated HHAs.

#### § § 489.62

        An HHA operated by a Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency is deemed to have provided CMS with a comparable surety bond under State law, and CMS therefore waives the requirements of this subpart with respect to such an HHA if, during the preceding 5 years the HHA has—

        (a) Not had any unpaid claims or unpaid civil money penalties or assessments; and

        (b) Not had any of its claims referred by CMS to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office in accordance with part 401 of this chapter.

        § 489.63   Parties to the bond.

#### § § 489.63

        The surety bond must name the HHA as Principal, CMS as Obligee, and the surety company (and its heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assignees, jointly and severally) as Surety.

        § 489.64   Authorized Surety and exclusion of surety companies.

#### § § 489.64

        (a) An HHA may obtain a surety bond required under § 489.61 only from an authorized Surety.

        (b) An authorized Surety is a surety company that—

        (1) Has been issued a Certificate of Authority by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225 as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and the Certificate has neither expired nor been revoked; and

        (2) Has not been determined by CMS to be an unauthorized Surety for the purpose of an HHA obtaining a surety bond under this section.

        (c) CMS determines that a surety company is an unauthorized Surety under this section—

        (1) If, upon request by CMS, the surety company fails to furnish timely confirmation of the issuance of, and the validity and accuracy of information appearing on, a surety bond an HHA presents to CMS that shows the surety company as Surety on the bond;

        (2) If, upon presentation by CMS to the surety company of a request for payment on a surety bond and of sufficient evidence to establish the surety company's liability on the bond, the surety company fails to timely pay CMS in full the amount requested, up to the face amount of the bond; or

        (3) For other good cause.

        (d) Any determination CMS makes under paragraph (c) of this section is effective immediately when notice of the determination is published in the  and remains in effect until a notice of reinstatement is published in the

        (e) Any determination CMS makes under paragraph (c) of this section does not affect the Surety's liability under any surety bond issued by a surety company to an HHA before notice of such determination is published in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f) A determination by CMS that a surety company is an unauthorized Surety under this section is not a debarment, suspension, or exclusion for the purposes of Executive Order No. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 comp., p. 189).

        § 489.65   Amount of the bond.

#### § § 489.65

        (a)  The amount of the surety bond must be $50,000 or 15 percent of the Medicare payments made by CMS to the HHA in the HHA's most recent fiscal year for which a cost report has been accepted by CMS, whichever is greater.

        (b)  The 15 percent is computed as follows:

        (1) For the initial bond—on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS to the HHA in the HHA's most recent fiscal year as shown in the HHA's most recent cost report that has been accepted by CMS. If the initial bond will cover less than a full fiscal year, the computation of the 15 percent will be based on the number of months of the fiscal year that the bond will cover.

        (2) For subsequent bonds—on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS in the most recent fiscal year for which a cost report has been accepted. However, if payments in the first six months of the current fiscal year differ from such an amount by more than 25 percent, then the amount of the bond is 15 percent of such payments projected on an annualized basis.

        (c)  For an HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA by purchasing the assets or the ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS to the participating or formerly participating HHA in the most recent fiscal year that a cost report has been accepted.

        (d)  For an HHA that undergoes a change of ownership the 15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS to the HHA for the most recently accepted cost report.

        (e)  For an HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA without purchasing the assets or the ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 percent computation does not apply.

        (f)  If an HHA's overpayment in the most recently accepted cost report exceeds 15 percent of annual payments, CMS may require the HHA to secure a bond in an amount up to or equal to the amount of overpayment, provided the amount of the bond is not less than $50,000.

        (g)  For an annual surety bond, or for a rider on a continuous surety bond, that is required to be submitted on or after June 1, 2005, notwithstanding any reference in this subpart to 15 percent as a basis for determining the amount of the bond, the amount of the bond or rider, as applicable, must be $50,000 or such amount as CMS specifies in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever amount is greater.

        § 489.66   Additional requirements of the surety bond.

#### § § 489.66

        The surety bond that an HHA obtains under this subpart must meet the following additional requirements:

        (a) The bond must guarantee that within 30 days of receiving written notice from CMS of an unpaid claim or unpaid civil money penalty or assessment, which notice contains sufficient evidence to establish the Surety's liability under the bond, the Surety will pay CMS, up to the stated amount of the bond—

        (1) The full amount of any unpaid claim, plus accrued interest, for which the HHA is responsible; and

        (2) The full amount of any unpaid civil money penalty or assessment imposed by CMS on the HHA, plus accrued interest.

        (b) The bond must provide the following:

        (1) The Surety is liable for unpaid claims, unpaid civil money penalties, and unpaid assessments that are discovered when the surety bond is in effect, regardless of when the payment, overpayment, or other event giving rise to the claim, civil money penalty, or assessment occurred, provided CMS makes a written demand for payment from the Surety during, or within 90 days after, the term of the bond.

        (2) If the HHA fails to furnish a bond meeting the requirements of this subpart F for the year following expiration of the term of an annual bond, or if the HHA fails to submit a rider when a rider is required to be submitted under this subpart, or if the HHA's provider agreement is terminated, the last bond or rider, as applicable, submitted by the HHA to CMS, which bond or applicable rider meets the requirements of this subpart, remains effective and the Surety remains liable for unpaid claims, civil money penalties, and assessments that—

        (i) CMS determines or imposes on or asserts against the HHA based on overpayments or other events that took place during or prior to the term of the last bond or rider; and

        (ii) Were determined or imposed during the 2 years following the date the HHA failed to submit a bond or required rider or the date the HHA's provider agreement is terminated, whichever is later.

        (c) The bond must provide that the Surety's liability to CMS under the bond is not extinguished by any action of the HHA, the Surety, or CMS, including but not necessarily limited to any of the following actions:

        (1) Action by the HHA or the Surety to terminate or limit the scope or term of the bond. The Surety's liability may be extinguished, however, when—

        (i) The Surety furnishes CMS with notice of such action not later than 10 days after receiving notice from the HHA of action by the HHA to terminate or limit the scope of the bond, or not later than 60 days before the effective date of such action by the Surety; or

        (ii) The HHA furnishes CMS with a new bond that meets the requirements of this subpart.

        (2) The Surety's failure to continue to meet the requirements of § 489.64(a) or CMS's determination that the surety company is an unauthorized Surety under § 489.64(b).

        (3) Termination of the HHA's provider agreement.

        (4) Any action by CMS to suspend, offset, or otherwise recover payments to the HHA.

        (5) Any action by the HHA to—

        (i) Cease operation;

        (ii) Sell or transfer any asset or ownership interest;

        (iii) File for bankruptcy; or

        (iv) Fail to pay the Surety.

        (6) Any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in obtaining the surety bond or by the Surety (or by the Surety's agent, if any) in issuing the surety bond, except that any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in identifying to the Surety (or to the Surety's agent) the amount of Medicare payments upon which the amount of the surety bond is determined will not cause the Surety's liability to CMS to exceed the amount of the bond.

        (7) The HHA's failure to exercise available appeal rights under Medicare or to assign such rights to the Surety.

        (d) The bond must provide that actions under the bond may be brought by CMS or by CMS's fiscal intermediaries.

        (e) The bond must provide the Surety's name, street address or post office box number, city, state, and zipcode to which the CMS notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section is to be sent.

        § 489.67   Term and type of bond.

#### § § 489.67

        (a) Each participating HHA that does not meet the criteria for waiver under § 489.62 must submit to CMS in a form as CMS may specify, a surety bond for a term beginning January 1, 1998. If an annual bond is submitted for the initial term, it must be effective through the end of the HHA's current fiscal year.

        (b)  The type of bond required to be submitted by an HHA under this subpart may be either—

        (1) An annual bond (that is, a bond that specifies an effective annual period corresponding to the HHA's fiscal year); or

        (2) A continuous bond (that is, a bond that remains in full force and effect from term to term unless it is terminated or canceled as provided for in the bond or as otherwise provided by law) that is updated by the Surety, via the issuance of a rider, for a particular fiscal year for which the bond amount has changed or will change.

        (c)  (1) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a surety bond with its enrollment application (Form CMS-855, OMB number 0938-0685). The term of the initial surety bond must be effective from the effective date of provider agreement as specified in § 489.13 of this part. However, if the effective date of the provider agreement is less than 30 days before the end of the HHA's current fiscal year, the HHA may obtain a bond effective through the end of the next fiscal year, provided the amount of the bond is the greater of $75,000 or 20 percent of the amount determined from the computation specified in § 489.65(c) as applicable.

        (2) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA through the purchase or transfer of assets or ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA must also ensure that the surety bond is effective from the date of such purchase or transfer.

        (d)  An HHA that undergoes a change of ownership must submit the surety bond to CMS not later than the effective date of the change of ownership and the bond must be effective from the effective date of the change of ownership through the remainder of the HHA's fiscal year.

        (e)  A government-operated HHA that, as of January 1, 1998, meets the criteria for waiver under § 489.62 but thereafter is determined by CMS to not meet such criteria, must submit a surety bond to CMS within 60 days after it receives notice from CMS that it no longer meets the criteria for waiver.

        (f)  An HHA that obtains a replacement surety bond from a different Surety to cover the remaining term of a previously obtained bond must submit the new surety bond to CMS within 30 days of obtaining the bond from the new Surety.

#### § § 489.68

        (a) The failure of a participating HHA to obtain, file timely, and maintain a surety bond in accordance with this subpart F and CMS's instructions is sufficient under § 489.53(a)(1) for CMS to terminate the HHA's provider agreement.

        (b) The failure of an HHA seeking to become a participating HHA to obtain and file timely a surety bond in accordance with this Subpart F and CMS's instructions is sufficient under § 489.12(a)(3) for CMS to refuse to enter into a provider agreement with the HHA.

        § 489.69   Evidence of compliance.

#### § § 489.69

        (a) CMS may at any time require an HHA to make a specific showing of being in compliance with the requirements of this Subpart F and may require the HHA to submit such additional evidence as CMS considers sufficient to demonstrate the HHA's compliance.

        (b) If requested by CMS to do so, the failure of an HHA to timely furnish sufficient evidence to CMS to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Subpart F is sufficient for CMS to terminate the HHA's provider agreement under § 489.53(a)(1) or to refuse to enter into a provider agreement with the HHA under § 489.12(a)(3), as applicable.

        § 489.70   Effect of payment by the Surety.

#### § § 489.70

        A Surety's payment to CMS under a bond for an unpaid claim or an unpaid civil money penalty or assessment, constitutes—

        (a) Collection of the unpaid claim or unpaid civil money penalty or assessment (to the extent the Surety's payment on the bond covers such unpaid claim, civil money penalty, or assessment); and

        (b) A basis for termination of the HHA's provider agreement under § 489.53(a)(1).

        § 489.71   Surety's standing to appeal Medicare determinations.

#### § § 489.71

        A Surety has standing to appeal any matter that the HHA could appeal, provided the Surety satisfies all jurisdictional and procedural requirements that would otherwise have applied to the HHA, and provided the HHA is not, itself, actively pursuing its appeal rights under this chapter, and provided further that, with respect to unpaid claims, the Surety has paid CMS all amounts owed to CMS by the HHA on such unpaid claims, up to the amount of the bond.

#### § § 489.72

        In the event a Surety has paid CMS on the basis of liability incurred under a bond obtained by an HHA under this subpart F, and to the extent the HHA that obtained such bond (or the Surety under § 489.71) is subsequently successful in appealing the determination that was the basis of the unpaid claim or unpaid civil money penalty or assessment that caused the Surety to pay CMS under the bond, CMS will refund to the Surety the amount the Surety paid to CMS to the extent such amount relates to the matter that was successfully appealed by the HHA (or by the Surety), provided all review, including judicial review, has been completed on such matter. Any additional amounts owing as a result of the appeal will be paid to the HHA.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 8203, Mar. 6, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

        § 489.100   Definition.

#### § § 489.100

        For purposes of this part,  means a written instruction, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State), relating to the provision of health care when the individual is incapacitated.

        § 489.102   Requirements for providers.

#### § § 489.102

        (a) Hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural emergency hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health agencies, providers of home health care (and for Medicaid purposes, providers of personal care services), hospices, and religious nonmedical health care institutions must maintain written policies and procedures concerning advance directives with respect to all adult individuals receiving medical care, or patient care in the case of a patient in a religious nonmedical health care institution, by or through the provider and are required to:

        (1) Provide written information to such individuals concerning—

        (i) An individual's rights under State law (whether statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate, at the individual's option, advance directives. Providers are permitted to contract with other entities to furnish this information but are still legally responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this section are met. Providers are to update and disseminate amended information as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days from the effective date of the changes to State law; and

        (ii) The written policies of the provider or organization respecting the implementation of such rights, including a clear and precise statement of limitation if the provider cannot implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience. At a minimum, a provider's statement of limitation should:

        (A) Clarify any differences between institution-wide conscience objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians;

        (B) Identify the state legal authority permitting such objection; and

        (C) Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected by the conscience objection.

        (2) Document in a prominent part of the individual's current medical record, or patient care record in the case of an individual in a religious nonmedical health care institution, whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive;

        (3) Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive;

        (4) Ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) regarding advance directives. The provider must inform individuals that complaints concerning the advance directive requirements may be filed with the State survey and certification agency;

        (5) Provide for education of staff concerning its policies and procedures on advance directives; and

        (6) Provide for community education regarding issues concerning advance directives that may include material required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, either directly or in concert with other providers and organizations. Separate community education materials may be developed and used, at the discretion of providers. The same written materials do not have to be provided in all settings, but the material should define what constitutes an advance directive, emphasizing that an advance directive is designed to enhance an incapacitated individual's control over medical treatment, and describe applicable State law concerning advance directives. A provider must be able to document its community education efforts.

        (b) The information specified in paragraph (a) of this section is furnished:

        (1) In the case of a hospital, at the time of the individual's admission as an inpatient.

        (2) In the case of a skilled nursing facility at the time of the individual's admission as a resident.

        (3)(i) In the case of a home health agency, in advance of the individual coming under the care of the agency. The HHA may furnish advance directives information to a patient at the time of the first home visit, as long as the information is furnished before care is provided.

        (ii) In the case of personal care services, in advance of the individual coming under the care of the personal care services provider. The personal care provider may furnish advance directives information to a patient at the time of the first home visit, as long as the information is furnished before care is provided.

        (4) In the case of a hospice program, at the time of initial receipt of hospice care by the individual from the program.

        (5) In the case of a rural emergency hospital, at the time of the individual's registration as a patient.

        (c) The providers listed in paragraph (a) of this section—

        (1) Are not required to provide care that conflicts with an advance directive.

        (2) Are not required to implement an advance directive if, as a matter of conscience, the provider cannot implement an advance directive and State law allows any health care provider or any agent of such provider to conscientiously object.

        (d) Prepaid or eligible organizations (as specified in sections 1833(a)(1)(A) and 1876(b) of the Act) must meet the requirements specified in § 417.436 of this chapter.

        (e) If an adult individual is incapacitated at the time of admission or at the start of care and is unable to receive information (due to the incapacitating conditions or a mental disorder) or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance directive, then the provider may give advance directive information to the individual's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law. The provider is not relieved of its obligation to provide this information to the individual once he or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. Follow-up procedures must be in place to provide the information to the individual directly at the appropriate time.

        (B) Equipment maintenance is provided by the manufacturer, is seldom needed, or can easily be performed.

        (ii)  (A) Troubleshooting is not automatic and requires decision-making and direct intervention to resolve most problems; or

        (B) Maintenance requires special knowledge, skills, and abilities.

        (7) —(i)  (A) Minimal interpretation and judgment are required to perform preanalytic, analytic and postanalytic processes; and

        (B) Resolution of problems requires limited independent interpretation and judgment; and

        (ii)  (A) Extensive independent interpretation and judgment are required to perform the preanalytic, analytic or postanalytic processes; and

        (B) Resolution of problems requires extensive interpretation and judgment.

        (b)  The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee, as defined in subpart T of this part, will conduct reviews upon request of HHS and recommend to HHS revisions to the criteria for categorization of tests.

        (c)  (1)(i) For new commercial test systems, assays, or examinations, the manufacturer, as part of its 510(k) and PMA application to FDA, will submit supporting data for device/test categorization. FDA will determine the complexity category, notify the manufacturers directly, and will simultaneously inform both CMS and CDC of the device/test category. FDA will consult with CDC concerning test categorization in the following three situations:

        (A) When categorizing previously uncategorized new technology;

        (B) When FDA determines it to be necessary in cases involving a request for a change in categorization; and

        (C) If a manufacturer requests review of a categorization decision by FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 10.75.

        (ii) Test categorization will be effective as of the notification to the applicant.

        (2) For test systems, assays, or examinations not commercially available, a laboratory or professional group may submit a written request for categorization to PHS. These requests will be forwarded to CDC for evaluation; CDC will determine complexity category and notify the applicant, CMS, and FDA of the categorization decision. In the case of request for a change of category or for previously uncategorized new technology, PHS will receive the request application and forward it to CDC for categorization.

        (3) A request for recategorization will be accepted for review if it is based on new information not previously submitted in a request for categorization or recategorization by the same applicant and will not be considered more frequently than once per year.

        (4) If a laboratory test system, assay or examination does not appear on the lists of tests in the  notices, it is considered to be a test of high complexity until PHS, upon request, reviews the matter and notifies the applicant of its decision. Test categorization is effective as of the notification to the applicant.

        (5) PHS will publish revisions periodically to the list of moderate and high complexity tests in the  in a notice with opportunity for comment.

#### § § 493.638

        (a)  Laboratories must pay a fee that covers the costs incurred for the issuance, renewal, change in certificate type, or reinstatement of a terminated certificate with a gap in service, and other direct administrative costs, as applicable. The total of fees collected by HHS under the laboratory program must be sufficient to cover the general costs of administering the laboratory certification program under section 353 of the PHS Act.

        (1) For registration certificates, the fee is a flat fee that includes the costs for issuing the certificates, collecting the fees, and evaluating whether the procedures, tests, or examinations listed on the application fall within the testing allowed for the requested certificate.

        (2) For a certificate of waiver, the fee includes the costs for issuing the certificate; collecting the fees; evaluating whether the procedures, tests, or examinations listed on the application fall within the testing appropriate for the requested certificate; and determining whether a laboratory test meets the criteria for a waived test.

        (3) For a certificate for PPM procedures, the fee includes the costs for issuing the certificate, collecting the fees; and evaluating whether the procedures, tests, or examinations listed on the application meet the criteria for inclusion in the subcategory of PPM procedures.

        (4) For a certificate of accreditation, the fee includes the costs for issuing the certificate, collecting the fees, evaluating the programs of accrediting bodies, and evaluating whether the procedures, tests, or examinations listed on the application fall within the testing appropriate for the requested certificate.

        (5) For a certificate of compliance, the fee includes the costs for issuing the certificates, collecting the fees, evaluating and monitoring proficiency testing programs, and evaluating whether the procedures, tests or examinations listed on the application fall within the testing appropriate for the requested certificate.

        (b)  (1) The certificate fee amount is set biennially by HHS. CMS will publish a notice in the  biennially with any adjustments to the fee amounts, including any adjustments due to inflation, in accordance with § 493.680. For certificates of waiver and certificates of PPM, the certificate fee amount is based on the category of test complexity performed by the laboratory. For all other certificate types, the fee amount is based on the category of test complexity performed by the laboratory and schedules or ranges of annual laboratory test volume (excluding waived tests and tests performed for quality control, quality assurance, or proficiency testing purposes) and specialties tested, with the amounts of the fees in each schedule being a function of the costs for all aspects of general administration of CLIA as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2) Certificate fees are assessed and payable at least biennially.

        (3) The amount of the fee payable by the laboratory is the amount listed in the most recent notice published in the  at the time the application, renewal, change in certificate type, or reinstatement is processed by HHS or its designee.

        (4) After processing an application for an issuance, renewal, change in certificate type, or reinstatement of a terminated certificate with a gap in service, HHS or its designee notifies the laboratory of the applicable fee amount.

        (c)  (1) For purposes of determining a laboratory's classification under this section, a test is a procedure or examination for a single analyte. (Tests performed for quality control, quality assessment, and proficiency testing are excluded from the laboratory's total annual volume.) Each profile (that is, group of tests) is counted as the number of separate procedures or examinations; for example, a chemistry profile consisting of 18 tests is counted as 18 separate procedures or tests.

#### § § 493.643

        (a)  In addition to the fee required under § 493.638, a laboratory subject to routine inspections must pay a fee to cover the cost of determining program compliance. Laboratories issued a certificate for PPM procedures, certificate of waiver, or a certificate of accreditation are not subject to this fee for routine inspections.

        (b)  Included in the fee for determining program compliance are costs for evaluating qualifications of laboratory personnel; monitoring laboratory proficiency testing; and conducting onsite inspections of laboratories including: documenting deficiencies, evaluating laboratories' plans to correct deficiencies, creating training programs, training surveyors, and necessary administrative costs.

        (c)  The amount of the fee for determining program compliance is set biennially by HHS.

        (1) The fee is based on the category of test complexity and schedules or ranges of annual laboratory test volume and specialties tested, with the amounts of the fees in each schedule being a function of the costs for all aspects of determining program compliance as set forth in § 493.638(c).

        (2) The fee is assessed and payable biennially.

        (3) The amount of the program compliance fee is the amount applicable to the laboratory listed in the most recent notice published in the  at the time that the fee is generated.

        (d)  (1) If a laboratory issued a certificate of compliance has been inspected and follow-up visits are necessary because of identified deficiencies, HHS assesses the laboratory a fee to cover the cost of these visits. The fee is based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the follow-up visits. HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate of compliance for failure to pay the assessed fee.

        (2) If, after a certificate of compliance is issued, a laboratory adds services and requests that its certificate be upgraded, the laboratory must pay an additional fee if, to determine compliance with additional requirements, it is necessary to conduct an inspection, evaluate personnel, or monitor proficiency testing performance. The additional fee is based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the activities. HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate for failure to pay the compliance determination fee.

        (3) If it is necessary to conduct a complaint investigation, impose sanctions, or conduct a hearing, HHS assesses the laboratory holding a certificate of compliance a fee to cover the cost of these activities. If a complaint investigation results in a complaint being unsubstantiated, or if an HHS adverse action is overturned at the conclusion of the administrative appeals process, the Government's costs of these activities are not imposed upon the laboratory. Costs for these activities are based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the activities and are not assessed until after the laboratory concedes the existence of deficiencies or an ALJ rules in favor of HHS. HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate of compliance for failure to pay the assessed costs.

        (4) Laboratories with a certificate of compliance must pay a fee if the laboratory fails to perform successfully in proficiency testing for one or more specialties, subspecialties, analytes, or tests specified in subpart I of this part, and it is necessary to conduct a desk review of the unsuccessful performance. The additional fee is based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the desk review. HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate of compliance for failure to pay the assessed costs.

#### § § 493.680

        (a)  Except for fees assessed to State laboratory programs approved by HHS, the fee amounts described in this subpart are subject to a biennial increase based on a two-part calculation of the Consumer Price Index—Urban (CPI-U) inflation adjustment and, if applicable, an additional increase as follows:

        (1) CMS calculates the inflation rate using the compounded CPI-U over 2 years and, provided that the calculated rate is greater than zero, applies an increase to all fee amounts equal to the calculated rate.

        (2) If the total fee amounts, including any increase applied under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, do not match or exceed actual program obligations based on a review of the previous 2 years' obligations, CMS applies an additional across the board increase to each laboratory's fees by calculating the difference between the total fee amounts and actual program obligations.

        (b)  Any increase applied under paragraph (a) of this section is incorporated into the baseline fee amounts for any subsequent biennial increase.

        (c)  Any increase applied under paragraph (a) of this section, including the calculation thereof, will be published as a notice in the .

          § 493.851   Standard; Hematology.

#### § § 493.851

          (a) Failure to attain a score of at least 80 percent of acceptable responses for each analyte in each testing event is unsatisfactory analyte performance for the testing event.

          (b) Failure to attain an overall testing event score of at least 80 percent is unsatisfactory performance.

          (c) Failure to participate in a testing event is unsatisfactory performance and results in a score of 0 for the testing event. Consideration may be given to those laboratories failing to participate in a testing event only if—

          (1) Patient testing was suspended during the time frame allotted for testing and reporting proficiency testing results;

          (2) The laboratory notifies the inspecting agency and the proficiency testing program within the time frame for submitting proficiency testing results of the suspension of patient testing and the circumstances associated with failure to perform tests on proficiency testing samples; and

          (3) The laboratory participated in the previous two proficiency testing events.

          (d) Failure to return proficiency testing results to the proficiency testing program within the time frame specified by the program is unsatisfactory performance and results in a score of 0 for the testing event.

          (e)(1) For any unsatisfactory analyte or test performance or testing event for reasons other than a failure to participate, the laboratory must undertake appropriate training and employ the technical assistance necessary to correct problems associated with a proficiency testing failure.

          (2) For any unacceptable analyte or testing event score, remedial action must be taken and documented, and the documentation must be maintained by the laboratory for two years from the date of participation in the proficiency testing event.

          (f) Failure to achieve satisfactory performance for the same analyte in two consecutive events or two out of three consecutive testing events is unsuccessful performance.

          (g) Failure to achieve an overall testing event score of satisfactory performance for two consecutive testing events or two out of three consecutive testing events is unsuccessful performance.

          § 493.853   Condition: Pathology.

#### § § 493.853

          The specialty of pathology includes, for purposes of proficiency testing, the subspecialty of cytology limited to gynecologic examinations.

          § 493.855   Standard; Cytology: gynecologic examinations.

#### § § 493.855

          To participate successfully in a cytology proficiency testing program for gynecologic examinations (Pap smears), the laboratory must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

          (a) The laboratory must ensure that each individual engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations is enrolled in a proficiency testing program approved by CMS by January 1, 1995, if available in the State in which he or she is employed. The laboratory must ensure that each individual is tested at least once per year and obtains a passing score. To ensure this annual testing of individuals, an announced or unannounced testing event will be conducted on-site in each laboratory at least once each year. Laboratories will be notified of the time of each announced on-site testing event at least 30 days prior to each event. Additional testing events will be conducted as necessary in each State or region for the purpose of testing individuals who miss the on-site testing event and for retesting individuals as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (b) The laboratory must ensure that each individual participates in an annual testing event that involves the examination of a 10-slide test set as described in § 493.945. Individuals who fail this testing event are retested with another 10-slide test set as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Individuals who fail this second test are subsequently retested with a 20-slide test set as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. Individuals are given not more than 2 hours to complete a 10-slide test and not more than 4 hours to complete a 20-slide test. Unexcused failure to appear by an individual for a retest will result in test failure with resulting remediation and limitations on slide examinations as specified in (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section.

          (1) An individual is determined to have failed the annual testing event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 10-slide test set. For an individual who fails an annual proficiency testing event, the laboratory must schedule a retesting event which must take place not more than 45 days after receipt of the notification of failure.

          (2) An individual is determined to have failed the second testing event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 10-slide test set. For an individual who fails a second testing event, the laboratory must provide him or her with documented, remedial training and education in the area of failure, and must assure that all gynecologic slides evaluated subsequent to the notice of failure are reexamined until the individual is again retested with a 20-slide test set and scores at least 90 percent. Reexamination of slides must be documented.

          (3) An individual is determined to have failed the third testing event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 20-slide test set. An individual who fails the third testing event must cease examining gynecologic slide preparations immediately upon notification of test failure and may not resume examining gynecologic slides until the laboratory assures that the individual obtains at least 35 hours of documented, formally structured, continuing education in diagnostic cytopathology that focuses on the examination of gynecologic preparations, and until he or she is retested with a 20-slide test set and scores at least 90 percent.

          (c) If a laboratory fails to ensure that individuals are tested or those who fail a testing event are retested, or fails to take required remedial actions as described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, CMS will initiate intermediate sanctions or limit the laboratory's certificate to exclude gynecologic cytology testing under CLIA, and, if applicable, suspend the laboratory's Medicare and Medicaid payments for gynecologic cytology testing in accordance with subpart R of this part.

        § 493.801   Condition: Enrollment and testing of samples.

#### § § 493.801

        Each laboratory must enroll in a proficiency testing (PT) program that meets the criteria in subpart I of this part and is approved by HHS. The laboratory must enroll in an approved program or programs for each of the specialties and subspecialties for which it seeks certification. The laboratory must test the samples in the same manner as patients' specimens. For laboratories subject to 42 CFR part 493 published on March 14, 1990 (55 FR 9538) prior to September 1, 1992, the rules of this subpart are effective on September 1, 1992. For all other laboratories, the rules of this subpart are effective January 1, 1994.

        (a)  The laboratory must—

        (1) Notify HHS of the approved program or programs in which it chooses to participate to meet proficiency testing requirements of this subpart.

        (2)(i) Designate the program(s) to be used for each specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test to determine compliance with this subpart if the laboratory participates in more than one proficiency testing program approved by CMS; and

        (ii) For those tests performed by the laboratory that are not included in subpart I of this part, a laboratory must establish and maintain the accuracy of its testing procedures, in accordance with § 493.1236(c)(1).

        (3) For each specialty, subspecialty and analyte or test, participate in one approved proficiency testing program or programs, for one year before designating a different program and must notify CMS before any change in designation; and

        (4) Authorize the proficiency testing program to release to HHS all data required to—

        (i) Determine the laboratory's compliance with this subpart; and

        (ii) Make PT results available to the public as required in section 353(f)(3)(F) of the Public Health Service Act.

        (b)  The laboratory must examine or test, as applicable, the proficiency testing samples it receives from the proficiency testing program in the same manner as it tests patient specimens. This testing must be conducted in conformance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the laboratory's patient specimen testing procedures would normally require reflex, distributive, or confirmatory testing at another laboratory, the laboratory should test the proficiency testing sample as it would a patient specimen up until the point it would refer a patient specimen to a second laboratory for any form of further testing.

        (1) The samples must be examined or tested with the laboratory's regular patient workload by personnel who routinely perform the testing in the laboratory, using the laboratory's routine methods. The individual testing or examining the samples and the laboratory director must attest to the routine integration of the samples into the patient workload using the laboratory's routine methods.

        (2) The laboratory must test samples the same number of times that it routinely tests patient samples.

        (3) The laboratory must report PT results for microbiology organism identification to the highest level that it reports results on patient specimens.

        (4) Laboratories that perform tests on proficiency testing samples must not engage in any inter-laboratory communications pertaining to the results of proficiency testing sample(s) until after the date by which the laboratory must report proficiency testing results to the program for the testing event in which the samples were sent. Laboratories with multiple testing sites or separate locations must not participate in any communications or discussions across sites/locations concerning proficiency testing sample results until after the date by which the laboratory must report proficiency testing results to the program.

        (5) The laboratory must not send proficiency testing samples or portions of proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for any analysis for which it is certified to perform in its own laboratory. Any laboratory that CMS determines intentionally referred a proficiency testing sample to another laboratory for analysis may have its certification revoked for at least 1 year. If CMS determines that a proficiency testing sample was referred to another laboratory for analysis, but the requested testing was limited to reflex, distributive, or confirmatory testing that, if the sample were a patient specimen, would have been in full conformance with written, legally accurate and adequate standard operating procedures for the laboratory's testing of patient specimens, and if the proficiency testing referral is not a repeat proficiency testing referral, CMS will consider the referral to be improper and subject to alternative sanctions in accordance with § 493.1804(c), but not intentional. Any laboratory that receives a proficiency testing sample from another laboratory for testing must notify CMS of the receipt of that sample regardless of whether the referral was made for reflex or confirmatory testing, or any other reason.

        (6) The laboratory must document the handling, preparation, processing, examination, and each step in the testing and reporting of results for all proficiency testing samples. The laboratory must maintain a copy of all records, including a copy of the proficiency testing program report forms used by the laboratory to record proficiency testing results including the attestation statement provided by the PT program, signed by the analyst and the laboratory director, documenting that proficiency testing samples were tested in the same manner as patient specimens, for a minimum of two years from the date of the proficiency testing event.

        (7) PT is required for only the test system, assay, or examination used as the primary method for patient testing during the PT event.

        § 493.803   Condition: Successful participation.

#### § § 493.803

        (a) Each laboratory performing nonwaived testing must successfully participate in a proficiency testing program approved by CMS, if applicable, as described in subpart I of this part for each specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test in which the laboratory is certified under CLIA.

        (b) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a laboratory fails to participate successfully in proficiency testing for a given specialty, subspecialty, analyte or test, as defined in this section, or fails to take remedial action when an individual fails gynecologic cytology, CMS imposes sanctions, as specified in subpart R of this part.

        (c) If a laboratory fails to perform successfully in a CMS-approved proficiency testing program, for the initial unsuccessful performance, CMS may direct the laboratory to undertake training of its personnel or to obtain technical assistance, or both, rather than imposing alternative or principle sanctions except when one or more of the following conditions exists:

        (1) There is immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.

        (2) The laboratory fails to provide CMS or a CMS agent with satisfactory evidence that it has taken steps to correct the problem identified by the unsuccessful proficiency testing performance.

        (3) The laboratory has a poor compliance history.

        § 493.807   Condition: Reinstatement of laboratories performing nonwaived testing.

#### § § 493.807

        (a) If a laboratory's certificate is suspended or limited or its Medicare or Medicaid approval is cancelled or its Medicare or Medicaid payments are suspended because it fails to participate successfully in proficiency testing for one or more specialties, subspecialties, analyte or test, or voluntarily withdraws its certification under CLIA for the failed specialty, subspecialty, or analyte, the laboratory must then demonstrate sustained satisfactory performance on two consecutive proficiency testing events, one of which may be on site, before CMS will consider it for reinstatement for certification and Medicare or Medicaid approval in that specialty, subspecialty, analyte or test.

        (b) The cancellation period for Medicare and Medicaid approval or period for suspension of Medicare or Medicaid payments or suspension or limitation of certification under CLIA for the failed specialty, subspecialty, or analyte or test is for a period of not less than six months from the date of cancellation, limitation or suspension of the CLIA certificate.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 7151, Feb. 28, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

        Proficiency Testing Programs by Specialty and Subspecialty

          § 493.909   Microbiology.

#### § § 493.909

          The subspecialties under the specialty of microbiology for which a program may offer proficiency testing are bacteriology, mycobacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology. Specific criteria for these subspecialties are found at §§ 493.911 through 493.919.

          § 493.911   Bacteriology.

#### § § 493.911

          (a)  To be approved for proficiency testing for bacteriology, the annual program must provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing events provided to the laboratory at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples may be provided to the laboratory through mailed shipments. The specific organisms included in the samples may vary from year to year.

          (1) The annual program must include, as applicable, samples for:

          (i) Gram stain including bacterial morphology;

          (ii) Direct bacterial antigen detection;

          (iii) Bacterial toxin detection; and,

          (iv) Detection and identification of bacteria which includes one of the following:

          (A) Detection of the presence or absence of bacteria without identification; or

          (B) Identification of bacteria; and

          (v) Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of select bacteria.

          (2) An approved program must furnish HHS and its agents with a description of samples that it plans to include in its annual program no later than 6 months before each calendar year. The program must include bacteria commonly occurring in patient specimens and other important emerging pathogens. The program determines the reportable isolates and correct responses for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for any designated isolate. At least 25 percent of the samples must be mixtures of the principal organism and appropriate normal flora. Mixed cultures are samples that require reporting of one or more principal pathogens. Mixed cultures are not “negative” samples such as when two commensal organisms are provided in a PT sample with the intended response of “negative” or “no pathogen present.” The program must include the following two types of samples to meet the 25 percent mixed culture criterion:

          (i) Samples that require laboratories to report only organisms that the testing laboratory considers to be a principal pathogen that is clearly responsible for a described illness (excluding immuno-compromised patients). The program determines the reportable isolates, including antimicrobial susceptibility for any designated isolate; and

          (ii) Samples that require laboratories to report all organisms present. Samples must contain multiple organisms frequently found in specimens where multiple isolates are clearly significant or where specimens are derived from immuno-compromised patients. The program determines the reportable isolates.

          (3) The content of an approved program must vary over time, as appropriate. The types of bacteria included annually must be representative of the following major groups of medically important aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, if appropriate for the sample sources:

          (i) Gram-negative bacilli.

          (ii) Gram-positive bacilli.

          (iii) Gram-negative cocci.

          (iv) Gram-positive cocci.

          (4) For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the program must provide at least two samples per testing event. The program must annually provide samples that include Gram-positive organisms and samples that include Gram-negative organisms that have a predetermined pattern of susceptibility or resistance to the common antimicrobial agents.

          (b)  HHS approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's responses in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section.

          (1) The program determines the reportable bacterial staining and morphological characteristics to be interpreted by Gram stain. The program determines the bacteria to be reported by direct bacterial antigen detection, bacterial toxin detection, detection of the presence or absence of bacteria without identification, identification of bacteria, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. To determine the accuracy of each of the laboratory's responses, the program must compare each response with the response which reflects agreement of either 80 percent or more of 10 or more referee laboratories or 80 percent or more of all participating laboratories. Both methods must be attempted before the program can choose to not grade a PT sample.

          (2) A laboratory must identify the organisms to highest level that the laboratory reports results on patient specimens.

          (3) A laboratory's performance will be evaluated on the basis of the average of its scores for paragraph (b)(4) through (8) of this section as determined in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.

          (4) The performance criteria for Gram stain including bacterial morphology is staining reaction, that is, Gram positive or Gram negative and morphological description for each sample. The score is the number of correct responses for Gram stain reaction plus the number of correct responses for morphological description divided by 2 then divided by the number of samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.

          (5) The performance criterion for direct bacterial antigen detection is the presence or absence of the bacterial antigen. The score is the number of correct responses divided by the number of samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.

          (6) The performance criterion for bacterial toxin detection is the presence or absence of the bacterial toxin. The score is the number of correct responses divided by the number of samples to be tested multiplied by 100.

          (7) The performance criterion for the detection and identification of bacteria includes one of the following:

          (i) The performance criterion for the detection of the presence or absence of bacteria without identification is the correct detection of the presence or absence of bacteria without identification. The score is the number of correct responses divided by the number of samples to be tested multiplied by 100.

          (ii) The performance criterion for the identification of bacteria is the total number of correct responses for bacterial identification submitted by the laboratory divided by the number of organisms present plus the number of incorrect organisms reported by the laboratory multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each sample in each testing event. Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of organisms in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s), the scoring system must provide a means of deducting credit for additional erroneous organisms that are reported. For example, if a sample contained one principal organism and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported the presence of an additional organism, which was not considered reportable, the sample grade would be 1/(1+1) × 100 = 50 percent.

          (8) For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, a laboratory must indicate which drugs are routinely included in its test panel when testing patient samples. A laboratory's performance will be evaluated for only those antimicrobials for which susceptibility testing is routinely performed on patient specimens. A correct response for each antimicrobial will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Scoring for each sample is based on the number of correct susceptibility responses reported by the laboratory divided by the actual number of correct susceptibility responses determined by the program, multiplied by 100. For example, if a laboratory offers susceptibility testing using three antimicrobial agents, and the laboratory reports correct responses for two of the three antimicrobial agents, the laboratory's grade would be   × 100 = 67 percent.

          (9) The score for a testing event in bacteriology is the average of the scores determined under paragraphs (b)(4) through (8) of this section based on the type of service offered by the laboratory.

          (i) Acid-fast stain; and

          (ii) Detection and identification of mycobacteria which includes one of the following:

          (A) Detection of the presence or absence of mycobacteria without identification; or

          (B) Identification of mycobacteria.

          (2) An approved program must furnish HHS and its agents with a description of the samples it plans to include in its annual program no later than 6 months before each calendar year. At least 25 percent of the samples must be mixtures of the principal mycobacteria and appropriate normal flora. The program must include mycobacteria commonly occurring in patient specimens and other important emerging mycobacteria. The program determines the reportable isolates and correct responses.

          (3) The content of an approved program may vary over time, as appropriate. The mycobacteria included annually must contain species representative of the following major groups of medically important mycobacteria, if appropriate for the sample sources:

          (i)  complex; and

          (ii)  other than tuberculosis (MOTT).

          (4) The program must provide at least five samples per testing event that include challenges that contain acid-fast organisms and challenges that do not contain acid-fast organisms.

          (b)  HHS approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.

          (1) The program determines the reportable mycobacteria to be detected by acid-fast stain. The program determines the mycobacteria to be reported by detection of the presence or absence of mycobacteria without identification, and identification of mycobacteria. To determine the accuracy of each of the laboratory's responses, the program must compare each response with the response that reflects agreement of either 80 percent or more of 10 or more referee laboratories or 80 percent or more of all participating laboratories. Both methods must be attempted before the program can choose to not grade a PT sample.

          (2) A laboratory must detect and identify the organisms to the highest level that the laboratory reports results on patient specimens.

          (3) A laboratory's performance will be evaluated on the basis of the average of its scores for paragraph (b)(4) through (5) of this section as determined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

          (4) The performance criterion for acid-fast stains is positive or negative or the presence or absence of acid-fast organisms. The score is the number of correct responses divided by the number of samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.

          (5) The performance criterion for the detection and identification of mycobacteria includes one of the following:

          (i) The performance criterion for the detection of the presence or absence of mycobacteria without identification is the correct detection of the presence or absence of mycobacteria without identification. The score is the number of correct responses divided by the number of samples to be tested multiplied by 100.

          (ii) The performance criterion for the identification of mycobacteria is the total number of correct responses for mycobacterial identification submitted by the laboratory divided by the number of organisms present plus the number of incorrect organisms reported by the laboratory multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each sample in each testing event. Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of mycobacteria in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s), the scoring system must provide a means of deducting credit for additional erroneous organisms reported. For example, if a sample contained one principal organism and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported the presence of an additional organism, which was not considered reportable, the sample grade would be 1/(1+1) × 100 = 50 percent.

          (6) The score for a testing event in mycobacteriology is the average of the scores determined under paragraphs (b)(4) through (5) of this section based on the type of service offered by the laboratory.

Proficiency testing programs may obtain slides for test sets from cytology laboratories, provided the slides have been retained by the laboratory for the required period specified in §§ 493.1105(a)(7)(i)(A) and 493.1274(f)(2). If slide preparations are still subject to retention by the laboratory, they may be loaned to a proficiency testing program if the program provides the laboratory with documentation of the loan of the slides and ensures that slides loaned to it are retrievable upon request. Each test set must include at least one slide representing each of the response categories described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, and test sets should be comparable so that equitable testing is achieved within and between proficiency testing providers.

          (2) To be approved for proficiency testing in gynecologic cytology, a program must provide announced and unannounced on-site testing for each individual at least once per year and must provide an initial retesting event for each individual within 45 days after notification of test failure and subsequent retesting events within 45 days after completion of remedial action described in § 493.855.

          (b)  HHS approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of each individual's responses on both 10- and 20-slide test sets in which the slides have been referenced as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

          (1) To determine the accuracy of an individual's response on a particular challenge (slide), the program must compare the individual's response for each slide preparation with the response that reflects the predetermined consensus agreement or confirmation on the diagnostic category, as described in the table in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. For all slide preparations, a 100% consensus agreement among a minimum of three physicians certified in anatomic pathology is required. In addition, for premalignant and malignant slide preparations, confirmation by tissue biopsy is required either by comparison of the reported biopsy results or reevaluation of biopsy slide material by a physician certified in anatomic pathology.

          (2) An individual qualified as a technical supervisor under § 493.1449(b) or (e) who routinely interprets gynecologic slide preparations only after they have been examined by a cytotechnologist can either be tested using a test set that has been screened by a cytotechnologist in the same laboratory or using a test set that has not been screened. A technical supervisor who screens and interprets slide preparations that have not been previously examined must be tested using a test set that has not been previously screened.

          (3) The criteria for acceptable performance are determined by using the scoring system in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.

          (i) Each slide set must contain 10 or 20 slides with point values established for each slide preparation based on the significance of the relationship of the interpretation of the slide to a clinical condition and whether the participant in the testing event is a cytotechnologist qualified under § 493.1469 or § 493.1483 or functioning as a technical supervisor in cytology qualified under § 493.1449(b) or (e) of this part.

          (ii) The scoring system rewards or penalizes the participants in proportion to the distance of their answers from the correct response or target diagnosis and the penalty or reward is weighted in proportion to the severity of the lesion.

          (A) The four response categories for reporting proficiency testing results and their descriptions are as follows:

          (B) In accordance with the criteria for the scoring system, the charts in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, for technical supervisors and cytotechnologists, respectively, provide a maximum of 10 points for a correct response and a maximum of minus five (−5) points for an incorrect response on a 10-slide test set. For example, if the correct response on a slide is “high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion” (category “D” on the scoring system chart) and an examinee calls it “normal or negative” (category “B” on the scoring system chart), then the examinee's point value on that slide is calculated as minus five (−5). Each slide is scored individually in the same manner. The individual's score for the testing event is determined by adding the point value achieved for each slide preparation, dividing by the total points for the testing event and multiplying by 100.

          (C) Criteria for scoring system for a 10-slide test set. (See table at paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for a description of the response categories.) For technical supervisors qualified under § 493.1449(b) or (e):

          (D) Criteria for scoring system for a 10-slide test set. (See table at paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for a description of the response categories.) For cytotechnologists qualified under § 493.1469 or § 493.1483:

          (E) In accordance with the criteria for the scoring system, the charts in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(F) and (G) of this section, for technical supervisors and cytotechnologists, respectively, provide maximums of 5 points for a correct response and minus ten (−10) points for an incorrect response on a 20-slide test set.

          (F) Criteria for scoring system for a 20-slide test set. (See table at paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for a description of the response categories.) For technical supervisors qualified under § 493.1449(b) or (e):

          (G) Criteria for scoring system for a 20-slide test set. (See table at (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for a description of the response categories.) For cytotechnologists qualified under § 493.1469 or § 493.1483:

          (b)  To be approved for proficiency testing for immunohematology, a program must provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual program must provide samples that cover the full range of interpretation that would be expected in patient specimens. The samples may be provided through mailed shipments.

          (c)  The minimum number of challenges per testing event a program must provide for each analyte or test procedure is five.

          (d)  HHS approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.

          (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response, a program must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the response that reflects agreement of either 100 percent of 10 or more referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating laboratories except for antibody identification. To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for antibody identification, a program must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the response that reflects agreement of either 95 percent or more of 10 or more referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating laboratories. Both methods must be attempted before the program can choose to not grade a PT sample.

          (2)  The criteria for acceptable performance are—

          (3) The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative immunohematology tests is positive or negative.

          (4) To determine the analyte testing event score, the number of acceptable analyte responses must be averaged using the following formula:

          (5) To determine the overall testing event score, the number of correct responses for all analytes must be averaged using the following formula:

        (i) Deficiencies found by CMS or its agents in the conduct of inspections to certify or validate compliance with Federal requirements, or through review of materials submitted by the laboratory (e.g., personnel qualifications).

        (ii) Unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing.

        (2) CMS imposes one or more of the alternative or principal sanctions specified in §§ 493.1806 and 493.1807 when CMS or CMS's agent finds that a laboratory has condition-level deficiencies.

        (c)  (1) CMS may impose alternative sanctions in lieu of, or in addition to, principal sanctions.

        (2) CMS may impose alternative sanctions other than a civil money penalty after the laboratory has had an opportunity to respond, but before the hearing specified in § 493.1844.

        (d)  CMS bases its choice of sanction or sanctions on consideration of one or more factors that include, but are not limited to, the following, as assessed by the State or by CMS, or its agents:

        (1) Whether the deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (2) The nature, incidence, severity, and duration of the deficiencies or noncompliance.

        (3) Whether the same condition level deficiencies have been identified repeatedly.

        (4) The accuracy and extent of laboratory records (e.g., of remedial action) in regard to the noncompliance, and their availability to the State, to other CMS agents, and to CMS.

        (5) The relationship of one deficiency or group of deficiencies to other deficiencies.

        (6) The overall compliance history of the laboratory including but not limited to any period of noncompliance that occurred between certifications of compliance.

        (7) The corrective and long-term compliance outcomes that CMS hopes to achieve through application of the sanction.

        (8) Whether the laboratory has made any progress toward improvement following a reasonable opportunity to correct deficiencies.

        (9) Any recommendation by the State agency as to which sanction would be appropriate.

        (e)  CMS may impose a separate sanction for each condition level deficiency or a single sanction for all condition level deficiencies that are interrelated and subject to correction by a single course of action.

        (f)  The appeal rights of laboratories dissatisfied with the imposition of a sanction are set forth in § 493.1844.

        (ii) It must revisit to verify whether the laboratory has, in fact, achieved compliance.

        (3)  If during a revisit, the laboratory presents credible evidence (as determined by CMS or its agent) that it achieved compliance before the date of revisit, sanctions are lifted as of that earlier date.

        § 493.1812   Action when deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

#### § § 493.1812

        If a laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, the following rules apply:

        (a) CMS requires the laboratory to take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and may impose one or more alternative sanctions to help bring the laboratory into compliance.

        (b) If the findings of a revisit indicate that a laboratory has not eliminated the jeopardy, CMS suspends or limits the laboratory's CLIA certificate no earlier than 5 days after the date of notice of suspension or limitation. CMS may later revoke the certificate.

        (c) In addition, if CMS has reason to believe that the continuation of any activity by any laboratory (either the entire laboratory operation or any specialty or subspecialty of testing) would constitute a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may bring suit and seek a temporary injunction or restraining order against continuation of that activity by the laboratory, regardless of the type of CLIA certificate the laboratory has and of whether it is State-exempt.

        (2) The directed plan of correction continues in effect until the day suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's CLIA certificate.

        § 493.1834   Civil money penalty.

#### § § 493.1834

        (a)  Sections 1846 of the Act and 353(h)(2)(B) of the PHS Act authorize the Secretary to impose civil money penalties on laboratories. Section 1846(b)(3) of the Act specifically provides that incrementally more severe fines may be imposed for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.

        (b)  This section sets forth the procedures that CMS follows to impose a civil money penalty in lieu of, or in addition to, suspending, limiting, or revoking the certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures of a laboratory that is found to have condition level deficiencies.

        (c)  CMS may impose a civil money penalty against any laboratory determined to have condition level deficiencies regardless of whether those deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (d) —(1)  In determining the amount of the penalty, CMS takes into account the following factors:

        (i) The nature, scope, severity, and duration of the noncompliance.

        (ii) Whether the same condition level deficiencies have been identified during three consecutive inspections.

        (iii) The laboratory's overall compliance history including but not limited to any period of noncompliance that occurred between certifications of compliance.

        (iv) The laboratory's intent or reason for noncompliance.

        (v) The accuracy and extent of laboratory records and their availability to CMS, the State survey agency, or other CMS agent.

        (2)  (i) For a condition level deficiency that poses immediate jeopardy, the range is $3,050-$10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day of noncompliance or per violation.

        (ii) For a condition level deficiency that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the range is $50-$3,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per day of noncompliance or per violation.

        (iii) For a condition level deficiency under §§ 493.41 or 493.1100(a), the penalty amount is $1,000 for the first day of noncompliance and $500 for each additional day of noncompliance.

        (3)  If the immediate jeopardy is removed, but the deficiency continues, CMS shifts the penalty amount to the lower range.

        (4)  CMS may, before the hearing, propose to increase the penalty amount for a laboratory that has deficiencies which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount, become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.

        (e) —(1)  (i) CMS sends the laboratory written notice, of CMS's intent to impose a civil money penalty.

        (ii) The notice includes the following information:

        (A) The statutory basis for the penalty.

        (B) The proposed daily or per violation amount of the penalty.

        (C) The factors (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) that CMS considered.

        (D) The opportunity for responding to the notice in accordance with § 493.1810(c).

        (E) A specific statement regarding the laboratory's appeal rights.

        (2)  (i) The laboratory has 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to impose a civil money penalty to request a hearing in accordance with § 493.1844(g).

        (ii) If the laboratory requests a hearing, all other pertinent provisions of § 493.1844 apply.

        (iii) If the laboratory does not request a hearing, CMS may reduce the proposed penalty amount by 35 percent.

        (f) —(1)  The civil money penalty begins accruing as follows:

        (i) 5 days after notice of intent if there is immediate jeopardy.

        (ii) 15 days after notice of intent if there is not immediate jeopardy.

        (2)  The civil money penalty continues to accrue until the earliest of the following occurs:

        (i) The laboratory's compliance with condition level requirements is verified on the basis of the evidence presented by the laboratory in its credible allegation of compliance or at the time or revisit.

        (ii) Based on credible evidence presented by the laboratory at the time of revisit, CMS determines that compliance was achieved before the revisit. (In this situation, the money penalty stops accruing as of the date of compliance.)

        (iii) CMS suspends, limits, or revokes the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures.

        (g) —(1)  CMS computes the total penalty amount after the laboratory's compliance is verified or CMS suspends, limits, or revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate but in no event before—

        (i) The 60 day period for requesting a hearing has expired without a request or the laboratory has explicitly waived its right to a hearing; or

        (ii) Following a hearing requested by the laboratory, the ALJ issues a decision that upholds imposition of the penalty.

        (2)  The notice includes the following information:

        (i) Daily or per violation penalty amount.

        (ii) Number of days or violations for which the penalty is imposed.

        (iii) Total penalty amount.

        (iv) Due date for payment of the penalty.

        (h)  (1) Payment of a civil money penalty is due 15 days from the date of the notice specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (2) CMS may approve a plan for a laboratory to pay a civil money penalty, plus interest, over a period of up to one year from the original due date.

        (i) —(1)  (i) The determined penalty amount may be deducted from any sums then or later owing by the United States to the laboratory subject to the penalty.

        (ii) Interest accrues on the unpaid balance of the penalty, beginning on the due date. Interest is computed at the rate specified in § 405.378(d) of this chapter.

        (2)  CMS has authority to settle any case at any time before the ALJ issues a hearing decision.

        § 493.1836   State onsite monitoring.

#### § § 493.1836

        (a)  (1) CMS may require continuous or intermittent monitoring of a plan of correction by the State survey agency to ensure that the laboratory makes the improvements necessary to bring it into compliance with the condition level requirements. (The State monitor does not have management authority, that is, cannot hire or fire staff, obligate funds, or otherwise dictate how the laboratory operates. The monitor's responsibility is to oversee whether corrections are made.)

        (2) The laboratory must pay the costs of onsite monitoring by the State survey agency.

        (i) The costs are computed by multiplying the number of hours of onsite monitoring in the laboratory by the hourly rate negotiated by CMS and the State.

        (ii) The hourly rate includes salary, fringe benefits, travel, and other direct and indirect costs approved by CMS.

        (b)  Before imposing this sanction, CMS provides notice of sanction and opportunity to respond in accordance with § 493.1810.

        (c)  (1) If CMS imposes onsite monitoring, the sanction continues until CMS determines that the laboratory has the capability to ensure compliance with all condition level requirements.

        (2) If the laboratory does not correct all deficiencies within 12 months, and a revisit indicates that deficiencies remain, CMS cancels the laboratory's approval for Medicare payment for its services and notifies the laboratory of its intent to suspend, limit, or revoke the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures.

        (3) If the laboratory still does not correct its deficiencies, the Medicare sanction continues until the suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures is effective.

        § 493.1838   Training and technical assistance for unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing.

#### § § 493.1838

        If a laboratory's participation in proficiency testing is unsuccessful, CMS may require the laboratory to undertake training of its personnel, or to obtain necessary technical assistance, or both, in order to meet the requirements of the proficiency testing program. This requirement is separate from the principal and alternative sanctions set forth in §§ 493.1806 and 493.1807.

        § 493.1840   Suspension, limitation, or revocation of any type of CLIA certificate.

#### § § 493.1840

        (a)  CMS may initiate adverse action to suspend, limit or revoke any CLIA certificate if CMS finds that a laboratory's owner or operator or one of its employees has—

        (1) Been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining a CLIA certificate;

        (2) Performed, or represented the laboratory as entitled to perform, a laboratory examination or other procedure that is not within a category of laboratory examinations or other procedures authorized by its CLIA certificate;

        (3) Failed to comply with the certificate requirements and performance standards;

        (4) Failed to comply with reasonable requests by CMS for any information or work on materials that CMS concludes is necessary to determine the laboratory's continued eligibility for its CLIA certificate or continued compliance with performance standards set by CMS;

        (5) Refused a reasonable request by CMS or its agent for permission to inspect the laboratory and its operation and pertinent records during the hours that the laboratory is in operation;

        (6) Violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provisions of CLIA and its implementing regulations;

        (7) Failed to comply with an alternative sanction imposed under this subpart; or

        (8) Within the preceding two-year period, owned or operated a laboratory that had its CLIA certificate revoked. (This provision applies only to the owner or operator, not to all of the laboratory's employees.)

        (b)  If CMS determines that a laboratory has intentionally referred its proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for analysis, CMS does one of the following:

        (1)(i) Revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate for at least 1 year, prohibits the owner and operator from owning or operating a CLIA-certified laboratory for at least 1 year, and may impose a civil money penalty in accordance with § 493.1834(d), if CMS determines that—

        (A) A proficiency testing referral is a repeat proficiency testing referral as defined at § 493.2; or

        (B) On or before the proficiency testing event close date, a laboratory reported proficiency testing results obtained from another laboratory to the proficiency testing program.

        (ii) Following the revocation of a CLIA certificate in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, CMS may exempt a laboratory owner from the generally applicable prohibition on owning or operating a CLIA-certified laboratory under paragraph (a)(8) of this section on a laboratory-by-laboratory basis if CMS finds, after review of the relevant facts and circumstances, that there is no evidence that—

        (A) Patients would be put at risk as a result of the owner being exempted from the ban on a laboratory-by-laboratory basis;

        (B) The laboratory for which the owner is to be exempted from the general ownership ban participated in or was otherwise complicit in the PT referral of the laboratory that resulted in the revocation; and

        (C) The laboratory for which the owner is to be exempted from the general ownership ban received a PT sample from another laboratory in the prior two survey cycles, and failed to immediately report such receipt to CMS or to the appropriate CMS-approved accrediting organization.

        (2) Suspends or limits the CLIA certificate for less than 1 year based on the criteria in § 493.1804(d) and imposes alternative sanctions as appropriate, in accordance with §§ 493.1804(c) and (d), 493.1806(c), 493.1807(b), 493.1809 and, in the case of civil money penalties, § 493.1834(d), when CMS determines that paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section does not apply but that the laboratory obtained test results for the proficiency testing samples from another laboratory on or before the proficiency testing event close date. Among other possibilities, alternative sanctions will always include a civil money penalty and a directed plan of correction that includes required training of staff.

        (3) Imposes alternative sanctions in accordance with §§ 493.1804(c) and (d), 493.1806(c), 493.1807(b), 493.1809 and, in the case of civil money penalties, § 493.1834(d), when CMS determines that paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (2) of this section do not apply, and a PT referral has occurred, but no test results are received prior to the event close date by the referring laboratory from the laboratory that received the referral. Among other possibilities, alternative sanctions will always include a civil money penalty and a directed plan of correction that includes required training of staff.

        (c)  If the OIG excludes a laboratory from participation in Medicare, CMS suspends the laboratory's CLIA certificate for the period during which the laboratory is excluded.

        (d) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CMS does not suspend or limit a CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing decision (as provided in § 493.1844) that upholds suspension or limitation.

        (2)  CMS may suspend or limit a CLIA certificate before the ALJ hearing in any of the following circumstances:

        (i) The laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (ii) The laboratory has refused a reasonable request for information or work on materials.

        (iii) The laboratory has refused permission for CMS or a CMS agent to inspect the laboratory or its operation.

        (e)  (1) CMS does not revoke any type of CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing that upholds revocation.

        (2) CMS may revoke a CLIA certificate after the hearing decision even if it had not previously suspended or limited that certificate.

        (f)  CMS notifies the OIG of any violations under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(6), and (b) of this section within 30 days of the determination of the violation.

        § 493.1842   Cancellation of Medicare approval.

#### § § 493.1842

        (a)  (1) CMS always cancels a laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services if CMS suspends or revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate.

        (2) CMS may cancel the laboratory's approval under any of the following circumstances:

        (i) The laboratory is out of compliance with a condition level requirement.

        (ii) The laboratory fails to submit a plan of correction satisfactory to CMS.

        (iii) The laboratory fails to correct all its deficiencies within the time frames specified in the plan of correction.

        (b)  Before canceling a laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services, CMS gives the laboratory—

        (1) Written notice of the rationale for, effective date, and effect of, cancellation;

        (2) Opportunity to submit written evidence or other information against cancellation of the laboratory's approval.

        This sanction may be imposed before the hearing that may be requested by a laboratory, in accordance with the appeals procedures set forth in § 493.1844.

        (c)  Cancellation of Medicare approval terminates any Medicare payment sanctions regardless of the time frames originally specified.

        § 493.1844   Appeals procedures.

#### § § 493.1844

        (a)  (1) The provisions of this section apply to all laboratories and prospective laboratories that are dissatisfied with any initial determination under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) Hearings are conducted in accordance with procedures set forth in subpart D of part 498 of this chapter, except that the authority to conduct hearings and issue decisions may be exercised by ALJs assigned to, or detailed to, the Departmental Appeals Board.

        (3) Any party dissatisfied with a hearing decision is entitled to request review of the decision as specified in subpart E of part 498 of this chapter, except that the authority to review the decision may be exercised by the Departmental Appeals Board.

        (4) When more than one of the actions specified in paragraph (b) of this section are carried out concurrently, the laboratory has a right to only one hearing on all matters at issue.

        (b)  The following actions are initial determinations and therefore are subject to appeal in accordance with this section:

        (1) The suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's CLIA certificate by CMS because of noncompliance with CLIA requirements.

        (2) The denial of a CLIA certificate.

        (3) The imposition of alternative sanctions under this subpart (but not the determination as to which alternative sanction or sanctions to impose).

        (4) The denial or cancellation of the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services.

        (c)  Actions that are not listed in paragraph (b) of this section are not initial determinations and therefore are not subject to appeal under this section. They include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

        (1) The finding that a laboratory accredited by a CMS-approved accreditation organization is no longer deemed to meet the conditions set forth in subparts H, J, K, M, and Q of this part. However, the suspension, limitation or revocation of a certificate of accreditation is an initial determination and is appealable.

        (2) The finding that a laboratory determined to be in compliance with condition-level requirements but has deficiencies that are not at the condition level.

        (3) The determination not to reinstate a suspended CLIA certificate because the reason for the suspension has not been removed or there is insufficient assurance that the reason will not recur.

        (4) The determination as to which alternative sanction or sanctions to impose, including the amount of a civil money penalty to impose per day or per violation.

        (5) The denial of approval for Medicare payment for the services of a laboratory that does not have in effect a valid CLIA certificate.

        (6) The determination that a laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

        (7) The amount of the civil money penalty assessed per day or for each violation of Federal requirements.

        (d) —(1)  The effective date of an alternative sanction (other than a civil money penalty) is not delayed because the laboratory has appealed and the hearing or the hearing decision is pending.

        (2) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, suspension, limitation, or revocation of a CLIA certificate is not effective until after a hearing decision by an ALJ is issued.

        (ii)  (A) If CMS determines that conditions at a laboratory pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the suspension or limitation of a CLIA certificate is not delayed because the laboratory has appealed and the hearing or the hearing decision is pending.

        (B) CMS may suspend or limit a laboratory's CLIA certificate before an ALJ hearing or hearing decision if the laboratory has refused a reasonable request for information (including but not limited to billing information), or for work on materials, or has refused permission for CMS or a CMS agent to inspect the laboratory or its operation.

        (3)  The effective date of the cancellation of a laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services is not delayed because the laboratory has appealed and the hearing or hearing decision is pending.

        (4)  (i) An ALJ decision is final unless, as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, one of the parties requests review by the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days, and the Board reviews the case and issues a revised decision.

        (ii) If an ALJ decision upholds a suspension imposed because of immediate jeopardy, that suspension becomes a revocation.

        (e) —(1)  Any prospective laboratory dissatisfied with a denial of a CLIA certificate, or of approval for Medicare payment for its services, may initiate the appeals process by requesting reconsideration in accordance with §§ 498.22 through 498.25 of this chapter.

        (2)  If CMS reopens an initial or reconsidered determination, CMS gives the prospective laboratory notice of the revised determination in accordance with § 498.32 of this chapter.

        (3)  Any prospective laboratory dissatisfied with a reconsidered determination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or a revised reconsidered determination under § 498.30 of this chapter is entitled to a hearing before an ALJ, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (4)  Any prospective laboratory that is dissatisfied with an ALJ's hearing decision or dismissal of a request for hearing may file a written request for review by the Departmental Appeals Board as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (f) —(1)  Any laboratory dissatisfied with the suspension, limitation, or revocation of its CLIA certificate, with the imposition of an alternative sanction under this subpart, or with cancellation of the approval to receive Medicare payment for its services, is entitled to a hearing before an ALJ as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and has 60 days from the notice of sanction to request a hearing.

        (2)  Any laboratory that is dissatisfied with an ALJ's hearing decision or dismissal of a request for hearing may file a written request for review by the Departmental Appeals Board, as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (3)  Any laboratory dissatisfied with the decision to impose a civil money penalty or to suspend, limit, or revoke its CLIA certificate may, within 60 days after the decision becomes final, file with the U.S. Court of Appeals of the circuit in which the laboratory has its principal place of business, a petition for judicial review.

        (g)  (1) If CMS suspends, limits, or revokes a laboratory's CLIA certificate or cancels the approval to receive Medicare payment for its services, CMS gives notice to the laboratory, and may give notice to physicians, providers, suppliers, and other laboratory clients, according to the procedures set forth at § 493.1832. In addition, CMS notifies the general public each time one of these principal sanctions is imposed.

        (2) The notice to the laboratory—

        (i) Sets forth the reasons for the adverse action, the effective date and effect of that action, and the appeal rights if any; and

        (ii) When the certificate is limited, specifies the specialties or subspecialties of tests that the laboratory is no longer authorized to perform, and that are no longer covered under Medicare.

        (3) The notice to other entities includes the same information except the information about the laboratory's appeal rights.

        (h)  (1) When the laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the adverse action is at least 5 days after the date of the notice.

        (2) When CMS determines that the laboratory's deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the adverse action is at least 15 days after the date of the notice.

        § 493.1846   Civil action.

#### § § 493.1846

        If CMS has reason to believe that continuation of the activities of any laboratory, including a State-exempt laboratory, would constitute a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may bring suit in a U.S. District Court to enjoin continuation of the specific activity that is causing the hazard or to enjoin the continued operation of the laboratory if CMS deems it necessary. Upon proper showing, the court shall issue a temporary injunction or restraining order without bond against continuation of the activity.

        § 495.5   Requirements for EPs seeking to reverse a hospital-based determination under § 495.4.

#### § § 495.5

        (a)  Beginning with payment year 2013, an EP who meets the definition of hospital-based EP specified in § 495.4 but who can demonstrate to CMS that the EP funds the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of Certified EHR Technology, including supporting hardware and interfaces needed for meaningful use without reimbursement from an eligible hospital or CAH, and uses such Certified EHR Technology in the inpatient or emergency department of a hospital (instead of the hospital's Certified EHR Technology), may be determined by CMS to be a nonhospital-based EP.

        (b)  When an EP registers for a given payment year they should receive a determination of whether they have been determined “hospital-based.”

        (1) An EP determined “hospital-based,” but who wishes to be determined nonhospital-based as specified in paragraph (a) of section, may use an administrative process to provide documentation and seek a nonhospital-based determination. Such administrative process will be available throughout the incentive payment year and including the 2 months following the incentive payment year in which the EP may attest to being a meaningful EHR user.

        (2) If an EP is determined nonhospital-based under paragraph (a) of this section, to be considered nonhospital-based for subsequent payment years, the EP must attest in such payment year (or by the time the EP must attest it is a meaningful EHR user for such year) that the EP continues to meet the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  An EP determined nonhospital-based must—

        (1) Continue to meet all applicable requirements to receive an incentive payment, including meeting all requirements for meaningful use; and

        (2) Demonstrate meaningful use using all encounters at all locations equipped with Certified EHR Technology, including those in the inpatient and emergency departments of the hospital.

        § 495.20   Meaningful use objectives and measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs before 2015.

#### § § 495.20

        The following criteria are applicable before 2015:

        (a) —(1)  Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, EPs must meet all objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria specified in paragraph (d) of this section and five objectives of the EP's choice from paragraph (e) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.

        (2)  (i) An EP may exclude a particular objective contained in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, if the EP meets all of the following requirements:

        (A) Must ensure that the objective in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section includes an option for the EP to attest that the objective is not applicable.

        (B) Meets the criteria in the applicable objective that would permit the attestation.

        (C) Attests.

        (ii) (A) An exclusion will reduce (by the number of exclusions applicable) the number of objectives that would otherwise apply. For example, an EP that has an exclusion from one of the objectives in paragraph (e) of this section must meet four (and not five) objectives of the EP's choice from such paragraph to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.

        (B) Beginning 2014, an exclusion does not reduce (by the number of exclusions applicable) the number of objectives that would otherwise apply in paragraph (e) of this section unless five or more objectives can be excluded. An EP must meet five of the objectives and associated measures specified in paragraph (e) of this section, one of which must be either paragraph (e)(9) or (10) of this section, unless the EP has an exclusion from five or more objectives specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in which case the EP must meet all remaining objectives and associated measures in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (3)  For Medicaid EPs who adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology in their first payment year, the meaningful use objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) apply beginning with the second payment year, and do not apply to the first payment year.

        (4)  For an EHR reporting period in 2014, if an EP could not fully implement 2014 Edition certified EHR technology due to delays in availability and uses—

        (i) Only 2011 Edition certified EHR technology, the EP must satisfy the objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria that were applicable for 2013; or

        (ii) A combination of 2011 Edition certified EHR technology and 2014 Edition certified EHR technology, the EP may choose to satisfy one of the following sets of objectives and associated measures:

        (A) The Stage 1 criteria that were applicable for 2013.

        (B) The Stage 1 criteria that are applicable beginning 2014.

        (C) If the EP is scheduled to begin Stage 2 in 2014, the Stage 2 criteria.

        (b) —(1)  Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, eligible hospitals and CAHs must meet all objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section and five objectives of the eligible hospital's or CAH's choice from paragraph (g) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.

        (2)  (i) An eligible hospital or CAH may exclude a particular objective that includes an option for exclusion contained in paragraphs (f) or (g) of this section, if the hospital meets all of the following requirements:

        (A) The hospital meets the criteria in the applicable objective that would permit an exclusion.

        (B) The hospital so attests.

        (ii)(A) An exclusion will reduce (by the number of exclusions received) the number of objectives that would otherwise apply. For example, an eligible hospital that is excluded from one of the objectives in paragraph (g) of this section must meet four (and not five) objectives of the hospital's choice from such paragraph to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.

        (B) Beginning 2014, an exclusion does not reduce (by the number of exclusions applicable) the number of objectives that would otherwise apply in paragraph (g) of this section. Eligible hospitals or CAHs must meet five of the objectives and associated measures specified in paragraph (g) of this section, one which must be specified in paragraph (g)(8), (9), or (10) of this section.

        (3)  For Medicaid eligible hospitals that adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology in their first payment year, the meaningful use objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section apply beginning with the second payment year, and do not apply to the first payment year.

        (4)  For an EHR reporting period in 2014, if an eligible hospital or CAH could not fully implement 2014 Edition certified EHR technology due to delays in availability and uses—

        (i) Only 2011 Edition certified EHR technology, the eligible hospital or CAH must satisfy the objectives and associated measures of the Stage 1 criteria that were applicable for 2013;

        (1) If a measure (or associated objective) in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section references paragraph (c) of this section, then the measure may be calculated by reviewing only the actions for patients whose records are maintained using certified EHR technology. A patient's record is maintained using certified EHR technology if sufficient data was entered in the certified EHR technology to allow the record to be saved, and not rejected due to incomplete data.

        (2) If the objective and associated measure does not reference this paragraph (c) of this section, then the measure must be calculated by reviewing all patient records, not just those maintained using certified EHR technology.

        (d)  An EP must satisfy the following objectives and associated measures, except those objectives and associated measures for which an EP qualifies for an exclusion under paragraph (a)(2) of this section specified in this paragraph:

#### § § 495.24

        The criteria specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are optional for 2017 and 2018 for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that have successfully demonstrated meaningful use in a prior year. The criteria specified in paragraph (d) of this section are applicable for all EPs for 2019 and subsequent years, and for eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to a State for the Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program for 2019 and subsequent years. The criteria specified in paragraph (e) of this section are applicable for eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to CMS for 2019 through 2022. The criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section are applicable for eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to CMS for 2023 and subsequent years.

        (a) —(1)  Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, EPs must meet all objectives and associated measures of the Stage 3 criteria specified in paragraph (d) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.

        (2)  An EP may meet the criteria for 2 out of the 3 measures associated with an objective, rather than meeting the criteria for all 3 of the measures, if the EP meets all of the following requirements:

        (i) Must ensure that the objective in paragraph (d) of this section includes an option to meet 2 out of the 3 associated measures.

        (ii) Meets the threshold for 2 out of the 3 measures for that objective.

        (iii) Attests to all 3 of the measures for that objective.

        (f)  (1) EPs are permitted to reassign their incentive payments to their employer or to an entity with which they have a contractual arrangement allowing the employer or entity to bill and receive payment for the EP's covered professional services.

        (2)(i) Assignments in Medicare must be consistent with Section 1842(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 42 CFR part 424 subpart F.

        (ii) Medicaid EPs may also assign their incentive payments to a TIN for an entity promoting the adoption of EHR technology, consistent with subpart D of this part.

        (3) Each EP may reassign the entire amount of the incentive payment to only one employer or entity.

        § 495.102   Incentive payments to EPs.

#### § § 495.102

        (a)  (1) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, in addition to the amount otherwise paid under section 1848 of the Act, there must be paid to a qualifying EP (or to an employer or entity in the cases described in section 1842(b)(6)(A) of the Act) for a payment year an amount equal to 75 percent of the estimated allowed charges for covered professional services furnished by the EP during the payment year.

        (2) For purposes of this paragraph (a) of this section, the estimated allowed charges for the qualifying EP's covered professional services during the payment year are determined based on claims submitted no later than 2 months after the end of the payment year, and, in the case of a qualifying EP who furnishes covered professional services in more than one practice, are determined based on claims submitted for the EP's covered professional services across all such practices.

        (b)  (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the amount of the incentive payment under paragraph (a) of this section for each payment year is limited to the following amounts:

        (i) For the first payment year, $15,000 (or, if the first payment year for such qualifying EP is 2011 or 2012, $18,000).

        (ii) For the second payment year, $12,000.

        (iii) For the third payment year, $8,000.

        (iv) For the fourth payment year, $4,000.

        (v) For the fifth payment year, $2,000.

        (vi) For any succeeding payment year for such professional, $0.

        (2)(i) If the first payment year for a qualifying EP is 2014, then the payment limit for a payment year for the qualifying EP is the same as the amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for such payment year for a qualifying EP whose first payment year is 2013.

        (ii) If the first payment year for a qualifying EP is after 2014, then the payment limit specified in this paragraph for such EP for such year and any subsequent year is $0.

        (c)  In the case of a qualifying EP who furnishes more than 50 percent of his or her covered professional services during the payment year in a geographic HPSA that is designated as of December 31 of the prior year, the incentive payment limit determined under paragraph (b) of this section is to be increased by 10 percent.

        (d)  (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section, for CY 2015 through the end of CY 2018, for covered professional services furnished by an EP who is not hospital-based, and who is not a qualifying EP by virtue of not being a meaningful EHR user (for the EHR reporting period applicable to the payment adjustment year), the payment amount for such services is equal to the product of the applicable percent specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the Medicare physician fee schedule amount for such services.

        (2)  Applicable percent is as follows:

        (i) For 2015, 99 percent if the EP is not subject to the payment adjustment for an EP who is not a successful electronic prescriber under section 1848(a)(5) of the Act, or 98 percent if the EP is subject to the payment adjustment for an EP who is not a successful electronic prescriber under section 1848(a)(5) of the Act).

        (ii) For 2016, 98 percent.

        (iii) For 2017, 97 percent.

        (iv) For 2018, 97 percent, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (3)  In CY 2018, if the Secretary finds that the proportion of EPs who are meaningful EHR users is less than 75 percent, the applicable percent must be decreased by 1 percentage point for EPs from the applicable percent in the preceding year.

        (4)  The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt an EP from the application of the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user would result in a significant hardship for the EP. To be considered for an exception, an EP must submit, in the manner specified by CMS, an application demonstrating that it meets one or more of the criteria in this paragraph (d)(4) unless otherwise specified in the criteria. The Secretary's determination to grant an EP an exemption may be renewed on an annual basis, provided that in no case may an EP be granted an exemption for more than 5 years.

        (i) During any 90-day period from the beginning of the year that is 2 years before the payment adjustment year to July 1 of the year preceding the payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS, the EP was located in an area without sufficient Internet access to comply with the meaningful use objectives requiring internet connectivity, and faced insurmountable barriers to obtaining such internet connectivity. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted no later than July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.

        (ii) The EP has been practicing for less than 2 years.

        (iii)(A) During the calendar year that is 2 calendar years before the payment adjustment year, the EP that has previously demonstrated meaningful use faces extreme and uncontrollable circumstances that prevent it from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted no later than July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.

        (B) During the calendar year preceding the payment adjustment year, the EP that has not previously demonstrated meaningful use faces extreme and uncontrollable circumstances that prevent it from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.

        (iv) An EP may request an exception through an application submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS due to difficulty in meeting meaningful use based on any one of the following during the period that begins 2 calendar years before the payment adjustment year through the application deadline:

        (A) The EP practices at multiple locations and can demonstrate inability to control the availability of Certified EHR Technology at one such practice location or a combination of practice locations, and where the location or locations constitute more than 50 percent of their patient encounters.

        (B) The EP can demonstrate difficulty in meeting meaningful use on the basis of lack of face-to-face or telemedicine interaction with patients and lack of need for follow up with patients.

        (C) The EP has a primary specialty listed in PECOS as anesthesiology, radiology or pathology 6 months prior to the first day of the payment adjustments that would otherwise apply. Such an EP may be deemed to qualify for this exception, subject to the 5-year limit that applies to all exceptions under this paragraph.

        (v) For the 2018 payment adjustment only, an EP who has not successfully demonstrated meaningful use in a prior year, intends to attest to meaningful use for an EHR reporting period in 2017 by October 1, 2017 to avoid the 2018 payment adjustment, and intends to transition to the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and report on measures specified for the advancing care information performance category under the MIPS in 2017. The EP must explain in the application why demonstrating meaningful use for an EHR reporting period in 2017 would result in a significant hardship. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted no later than October 1, 2017, or a later date specified by CMS.

        (5)  The Secretary shall exempt an EP from the application of the payment adjustment for CY 2018 under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user is not possible because the certified EHR technology used by the EP has been decertified under ONC's Health IT Certification Program. To be considered for an exception, an EP must submit, in the manner specified by CMS, an application demonstrating that the certified EHR technology was decertified during the 12-month period preceding the applicable EHR reporting period for the CY 2018 payment adjustment year, or during the applicable EHR reporting period for the CY 2018 payment adjustment year, and that the EP made a good faith effort to obtain another certified EHR technology for that EHR reporting period. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted no later than October 1, 2017, or a later date specified by CMS.

        (6)  No payment adjustment under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section may be made in the case of a hospital-based eligible professional, as defined in § 495.4.

        (7)  For the CY 2017 and CY 2018 payment adjustment years, no payment adjustment under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section may be made in the case of an ambulatory surgical center-based eligible professional, as defined in § 495.4.

        § 495.104   Incentive payments to eligible hospitals.

#### § § 495.104

        (a)  A qualifying hospital (as defined in this subpart) must receive the special incentive payment as determined under the formulas described in paragraph (c) of this section for the period specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  Subject to paragraph (d) of this section and the payment formula specified in paragraph (c) of this section, qualifying hospitals may receive incentive payments during transition periods which comprise the following fiscal years:

        (1) Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2011 may receive such payments for FYs 2011 through 2014.

        (2) Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2012 may receive such payments for FYs 2012 through 2015.

        (3) Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2013 may receive such payments for FYs 2013 through 2016.

        (4) Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2014 may receive such payments for FY 2014 through 2016.

        (5) Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2015 may receive such payments for FY 2015 through 2016.

        (6) Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2016 may receive such payments for FYs 2016 through 2019.

        (7) Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2017 may receive such payments for FYs 2017 through 2020.

        (8) Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2018 may receive such payments for FYs 2018 through 2021.

        (9) Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2019 may receive such payments for FYs 2019 through 2021.

        (10) Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2020 may receive such payments for FYs 2020 through 2021.

        (c)  (1) The incentive payment for each payment year is calculated as the product of the following:

        (i) The initial amount determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (ii) The Medicare share fraction determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (iii) The transition factor determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

        (2)  CMS uses data on hospital acute care inpatient discharges, Medicare Part A acute care inpatient bed-days, Medicare Part C acute care inpatient bed-days, and total acute care inpatient bed-days from the latest submitted 12-month hospital cost report as the basis for making preliminary incentive payments. Final payments are determined at the time of settling the first 12-month hospital cost report for the hospital fiscal year that begins on or after the first day of the payment year, and settled on the basis of data from that cost reporting period. In cases where there is no 12-month hospital cost report period beginning on or after the first day of the payment year, final payments may be determined and settled on the basis of data from the most recently submitted 12-month hospital cost report.

        (3)  The initial amount is equal to one of the following:

        (i) For each hospital with 1,149 acute care inpatient discharges or fewer, $2,000,000.

        (ii) For each hospital with at least 1,150 but no more than 23,000 acute care inpatient discharges, $2,000,000 + [$200 × (n − 1,149)], where n is the number of discharges for the hospital.

        (iii) For each hospital with more than 23,000 acute care inpatient discharges, $6,370,200.

        (4) —(i)  (A) CMS determines the _Medicare share fraction_ for an eligible hospital by using the number of Medicare Part A, Medicare Part C, and total acute care inpatient-bed-days using data from the Medicare cost report as specified by CMS.

        (B) CMS computes the denominator of the Medicare share fraction using the charity care charges reported on the hospital's Medicare cost report.

        (ii) The Medicare share fraction is the ratio of—

        (A) A numerator which is the sum of—

        () The number of inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to individuals with respect to whom payment may be made under Part A, including individuals enrolled in section _1_876 Medicare cost plans; and

        () The number of inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to individuals who are enrolled with a Medicare Advantage organization (as defined in § 4_2_2.2 of this chapter).

        (B) A denominator which is the product of—

        () The total number of acute care inpatient-bed-days; and

        () The total amount of the eligible hospital's charges, not including any charges that are attributable to charity care, divided by the estimated total amount of the hospitals charges.

        (5)  For purposes of the payment formula, the transition factor is as follows:

        (i) For hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2011—

        (A) 1 for FY 2011;

        (B)   for FY 2012;

        (C)   for FY 2013; and

        (D)   for FY 2014.

        (ii) For hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2012—

        (A) 1 for FY 2012;

        (B)   for FY 2013;

        (C)   for FY 2014; and

        (D)   for FY 2015;

        (iii) For hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2013—

        (A) 1 for FY 2013;

        (B)   for FY 2014;

        (C)   for FY 2015; and

        (D)   for FY 2016.

        (iv) For hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2014—

        (A)   for FY 2014;

        (B)   for FY 2015; and

        (C)   for FY 2016.

        (v) For hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2015—

        (A)   for FY 2015; and

        (B)   for FY 2016.

        (vi) For Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2016—

        (B)   for FY 2017;

        (C)   for FY 2018; and

        (D)   for FY 2019.

        (vii) For Puerto Rico eligible hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2017—

        (A) 1 for FY 2017;

        (B)   for FY 2018;

        (C)   for FY 2019; and

        (D)   for FY 2020;

        § 495.106   Incentive payments to CAHs.

#### § § 495.106

        (a)  In this section, unless otherwise indicated—

        means a Federal fiscal year beginning after FY 2010 but before FY 2016.

        means a CAH that would meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user at § 495.4, if it were an eligible hospital.

        for a qualifying CAH means the reasonable acquisition costs incurred for the purchase of depreciable assets as described in part 413 subpart G of this chapter, such as computers and associated hardware and software, necessary to administer certified EHR technology as defined in § 495.4, excluding any depreciation and interest expenses associated with the acquisition.

        (b)  A qualifying CAH receives an incentive payment for its reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section for a cost reporting period beginning during a payment year as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) —(1)  A qualifying CAH receives an incentive payment amount equal to the product of its reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology and the Medicare share percentage.

        (2)  CMS or its Medicare contractor computes a qualifying CAH's reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, as the sum of—

        (i) The reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology during the cost reporting period that begins in a payment year; and

        (ii) Any reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology in cost reporting periods beginning in years prior to the payment year which have not been fully depreciated as of the cost reporting period beginning in the payment year.

        (3)  Notwithstanding the percentage applicable under § 413.70(a)(1) of this chapter, the Medicare share percentage equals the lesser of—

        (i) 100 percent; or

        (ii) The sum of the Medicare share fraction for the CAH as calculated under § 495.104(c)(4) of this subpart and 20 percentage points.

        (d)  (1) The amount of the incentive payment made to a qualifying CAH under this section represents the expensing and payment of the reasonable costs computed in paragraph (c) of this section in a single payment year and, as specified in § 413.70(a)(5) of this chapter, such payment is made in lieu of payment that would have been made under § 413.70(a)(1) of this chapter for the reasonable costs of the purchase of certified EHR technology including depreciation and interest expenses associated with the acquisition.

        (2) The amount of the incentive payment made to a qualifying CAH under this section is paid through a prompt interim payment for the applicable payment year after—

        (i) The CAH submits the necessary documentation, as specified by CMS or its Medicare contractors, to support the computation of the incentive payment amount under this section; and

        (ii) CMS or its Medicare contractor reviews such documentation and determines the interim amount of the incentive payment.

        (3) The interim incentive payment made under this paragraph is subject to a reconciliation process as specified by CMS and the final incentive payment as determined by CMS or its Medicare contractor is considered payment in full for the reasonable costs incurred for the purchase of certified EHR technology in a single payment year.

        (4) In no case may an incentive payment be made with respect to a cost reporting period beginning during a payment year before FY 2011 or after FY 2015 and in no case may a CAH receive an incentive payment under this section with respect to more than 4 consecutive payment years.

        (e)  For cost reporting periods beginning in FY 2015, if a CAH is not a qualifying CAH for a payment adjustment year, then the payment for inpatient services furnished by a CAH under § 413.70(a) of this chapter is adjusted by the applicable percentage described in § 413.70(a)(6) of this chapter unless otherwise exempt from such adjustment.

        (f)  There is no administrative or judicial review under sections 1869 or 1878 of the Act, or otherwise, of the—

        (1) Methodology and standards for determining the amount of payment, the reasonable cost, and adjustments described in this section including selection of periods for determining, and making estimates or using proxies of, inpatient-bed-days, hospital charges, charity charges, and the Medicare share percentage as described in this section;

        (2) Methodology and standards for determining if a CAH is a qualifying CAH under this section;

        (3) Specification of EHR reporting periods, cost reporting periods, payment years, and fiscal years used to compute the CAH incentive payment as specified in this section; and

        (4) Identification of the reasonable costs used to compute the CAH incentive payment under paragraph (c) of this section including any reconciliation of the CAH incentive payment amount made under paragraph (d) of this section.

#### § § 495.200

        As used in this subpart:

        means with respect to—

        (1) Covered professional services furnished by a qualifying MA EP, the first calendar year for which an incentive payment is made for such services under this subsection to a qualifying MA organization.

        (2) Qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, the first fiscal year for which an incentive payment is made for qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under this section to a qualifying MA organization.

        is defined in the same manner and is used in the same manner as that term is defined and used for purposes of implementing section 4201(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 with respect to the Medicare FFS hospital EHR incentive program in § 495.104 of this part.

        means—

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this definition, for qualifying MA organizations that receive an MA EHR incentive payment for at least 1 payment year, calendar years beginning with CY 2015.

        (2) For qualifying MA organizations that receive an MA EHR incentive payment for a qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital in Puerto Rico for at least 1 payment year, and that have not previously received an MA EHR incentive payment for a qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital not in Puerto Rico, calendar years beginning with CY 2022.

        (3) For MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, the applicable EHR reporting period for purposes of determining whether the MA organization is subject to a payment adjustment is the Federal fiscal year ending in the MA payment adjustment year.

        (4) For MA EPs, the applicable EHR reporting period for purposes of determining whether the MA organization is subject to a payment adjustment is the calendar year concurrent with the payment adjustment year.

        means health care services for which payment would be made under, or for which payment would be based on, the fee schedule established under Medicare Part B if they were furnished by an EP to a Medicare beneficiary.

        means—

        (1) For a qualifying MA EP, a calendar year beginning with CY 2011 and ending with CY 2016; and

        (2) For an eligible hospital, a Federal fiscal year beginning with FY 2011 and ending with FY 2016; and

        § 495.202   Identification of qualifying MA organizations, MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals.

#### § § 495.202

        (a)  (1) Beginning with bids due in June 2011 (for plan year 2012), MA organizations seeking reimbursement for qualifying MA EPs and qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under the MA EHR incentive program are required to identify themselves to CMS in a form and manner specified by CMS, as part of submissions of initial bids under section 1854(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

        (2) Qualifying MA organizations offering MA HMO plans, absent evidence to the contrary, are deemed to meet the definition of HMO in 42 U.S.C. 300gg-91(b)(3)—section 2791(b)(3) of the PHS Act.

        (3) Qualifying MA organizations offering MA plan types other than HMOs, must attest to the fact that they meet the definition of HMO in 42 U.S.C. 300gg-91(b)(3)—section 2791(b)(3) of the PHS Act.

        (4) Beginning with bids due in June 2014 (for plan year 2015), all MA organizations with potentially qualifying MA EPs or potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under the MA EHR incentive program must identify themselves to CMS in a form and manner specified by CMS, as part of submissions of initial bids under section 1854(a)(1)(A) of the Act. “Potentially qualifying MA EPs” and “potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals” are those EPs and hospitals that meet the respective definitions of “qualifying MA EP” and “qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital” in § 495.200 but who (or which) are not meaningful users of certified EHR technology.

        (b)  (1) A qualifying MA organization, as part of its initial bid starting with plan year 2012, must make a preliminary identification of MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that the MA organization believes will be qualifying MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals for which the organization is seeking incentive payments for the current plan year.

        (2) A qualifying MA organization must provide CMS with the following for each MA EP or eligible hospital when reporting under either paragraph (b)(1) or (4) of this section:

        (i) The MA EP's or MA-affiliated eligible hospital's name.

        (ii) The address of the MA EP's practice or MA-affiliated eligible hospital's location.

        (iii) NPI or CCN.

        (iv) An attestation by MA organization specifying that the MA EP or MA-affiliated eligible hospital meets the eligibility criteria.

        (3) When reporting under either paragraph (b)(1) or (4) of this section for purposes of receiving an incentive payment, a qualifying MA organization must also indicate whether more than 50 percent of the covered Medicare professional services being furnished by a qualifying MA EP to MA plan enrollees of the MA organization are being furnished in a designated geographic HPSA (as defined in § 495.100 of this part).

        (4) Final identification of qualifying and potentially qualifying, as applicable, MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals must be made within 2 months of the close of the payment year or the EHR reporting period that applies to the payment adjustment year as defined in § 495.200.

        (5) Beginning plan year 2015 and for subsequent plan years, all qualifying MA organizations, as part of their initial bids in June for the following plan year must—

        (i) Identify all MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals of the MA organization that the MA organization believes will be either qualifying or potentially qualifying;

        (ii) Include information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section for each professional or hospital; and

        (iii) Include an attestation that each professional and hospital either meets or does not meet the EHR incentive payment eligibility criteria.

        § 495.204   Incentive payments to qualifying MA organizations for qualifying MA-EPs and qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals.

#### § § 495.204

        (a)  A qualifying MA organization receives an incentive payment for its qualifying MA-EPs and its qualifying MA-eligible hospitals. The incentive payment amount paid to a qualifying MA organization for a—

        (1) Qualifying MA-EP is the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section; and

        (2) Qualifying MA-eligible hospital is the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  (1) CMS substitutes an amount determined to be equivalent to the amount computed under § 495.102 of this part.

        (2) The qualifying MA organization must report to CMS within 2 months of the close of the calendar year, the aggregate annual amount of revenue attributable to providing services that would otherwise be covered as professional services under Part B received by each qualifying MA EP for enrollees in MA plans of the MA organization in the payment year.

        (3) CMS calculates the incentive amount for the MA organization for each qualifying MA EP as an amount equal to 75 percent of the reported annual revenue specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, up to the maximum amounts specified under section 1848(o)(1)(B) of the Act.

        (4) CMS requires the qualifying MA organization to develop a methodological proposal for estimating the portion of each qualifying MA EP's salary or revenue attributable to providing services that would otherwise be covered as professional services under Part B to MA plan enrollees of the MA organization in the payment year. The methodological proposal—

        (i) Must be approved by CMS; and

        (ii) May include an additional amount related to overhead, where appropriate, estimated to account for the MA-enrollee related Part B practice costs of the qualifying MA EP.

        (iii) Methodological proposals must be submitted to CMS by June of the payment year and must be auditable by an independent third-party. CMS will review and approve or disapprove such proposals in a timely manner.

        (5) For qualifying MA EPs who are not salaried, qualifying MA organizations may obtain attestations from such qualifying MA EPs (or from entities that the MA EPs are employed by or with which they have a partnership interest) as to the amount of compensation received by such EPs for MA plan enrollees of the MA organization. The organizations may submit to CMS compensation information for each such MA EP based on such attestations.

        (6) For qualifying MA EPs who are not salaried, qualified MA organizations may have qualifying MA EPs (or from entities that the MA EPs are employed by or with which they have a partnership interest) send MA organization compensation information directly to CMS. CMS will use the information provided in this subparagraph or paragraph (b)(5) of this section for no other purpose than to compute the amount of EHR incentive payment due the MA organization.

        (c)  (1)(i) CMS substitutes an amount determined to be equivalent to the amount computed under § 495.104, to the extent data are not available to compute payments for qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under the Medicare FFS EHR hospital incentive program.

        (ii) CMS uses the same methodology and defines “inpatient-bed-days”and other terms as used under the Medicare FFS EHR hospital incentive program in § 495.104 of this part in computing amounts due qualifying MA organizations for MA-affiliated eligible hospitals.

        (2) To the extent data are available, qualifying MA organizations must receive hospital incentive payments through their affiliated hospitals under the Medicare FFS EHR hospital incentive program, rather than through the MA EHR hospital incentive program.

        (d)  CMS makes payment to qualifying MA organizations for qualifying MA EPs only under the MA EHR incentive program and not under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program to the extent an EP has earned less than the maximum incentive payment for the same period under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program.

        (e)  In the case of a qualifying MA EP who furnishes more than 50 percent of his or her covered professional services to MA plan enrollees of the qualifying MA organization during a payment year in a geographic HPSA, the maximum amounts referred to in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are increased by 10 percent.

        (f)  To ensure the accuracy of the incentive payments, CMS conducts selected compliance reviews of qualifying MA organizations to ensure that EPs and eligible hospitals for which such qualifying organizations received incentive payments were meaningful EHR users in accordance with § 422.504 of this chapter.

        (1) The reviews include validation of the status of the organization as a qualifying MA organization, verification of meaningful use and review of data used to calculate incentive payments.

        (2) MA organizations are required to maintain evidence of their qualification to receive incentive payments and the data necessary to accurately calculate incentive payments.

        (3) Documents and records must be maintained for 6 years from the date such payments are made with respect to a given payment year.

        (4) Payments that result from incorrect or fraudulent attestations, cost data, or any other submission required to establish eligibility or to qualify for such payment, will be recouped by CMS from the MA organization.

        (5) If an MA EP, or entity that employs an MA EP, or in which an MA EP has a partnership interest, MA-affiliated eligible hospital, or other party contracting with the MA organization, fails to comply with an audit request to produce applicable documents or data, CMS recoups all or a portion of the incentive payment, based on the lack of applicable documents or data.

        (g)  (1) If, after payment is made to an MA organization for an MA EP, it is determined that the MA EP is eligible for the full incentive payment under the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program or has received a payment under the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, CMS recoups amounts applicable to the given MA EP from the MA organization's monthly MA payment, or otherwise recoups the applicable amounts.

        (2) If, after payment is made to an MA organization for an MA-affiliated eligible hospital, it is determined that the hospital is ineligible for the incentive payment under the MA EHR Incentive Program, or has received a payment under the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program, or if it is determined that all or part of the payment should not have been made on behalf of the MA-affiliated eligible hospital, CMS recoups amounts applicable to the given MA-affiliated eligible hospital from the MA organization's monthly MA payment, or otherwise recoups the applicable amounts.

        § 495.206   Timeframe for payment to qualifying MA organizations.

#### § § 495.206

        (a) CMS makes payment to qualifying MA organizations for qualifying MA EPs under the MA EHR incentive program after computing incentive payments due under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program according to § 495.102.

        (b) Payments to qualifying MA organizations for qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under common corporate governance are made under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, following the timeline in specified in § 495.104 of this part. To the extent sufficient data do not exist to pay qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under common corporate governance under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, payment is made under the MA EHR incentive program, following the same timeline in § 495.104 of this part.

        § 495.208   Avoiding duplicate payment.

#### § § 495.208

        (a) CMS requires a qualifying MA organization that registers MA EPs for the purpose of participating in the MA EHR Incentive Program to notify each of the MA EPs for which it is claiming an incentive payment that the MA organization intends to claim, or has claimed, the MA EP for the current plan year under the MA EHR Incentive Program.

        (b) The notice must make clear that the MA EP may still directly receive an EHR incentive payment if the MA EP is entitled to a full incentive payment under the FFS portion of the EHR Incentive Program, or if the MA EP registered to participate under the Medicaid portion of the EHR Incentive Program and is entitled to payment under that program—in both of which cases no payment would be made for the EP under the MA EHR incentive program.

        (c) An attestation by the qualifying MA organization that the qualifying MA organization provided notice to its MA EPs in accordance with this section must be required at the time that meaningful use attestations are due with respect to MA EPs for the payment year.

        (d) Unless a qualifying MA EP is entitled to a maximum payment for a year under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, payment for such an individual is only made under the MA EHR incentive program to a qualifying MA organization.

        (e) Payment to qualifying MA organizations for a qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital under common governance only occurs under the MA EHR incentive program to the extent that sufficient data does not exist to pay such hospital under the Medicare FFS hospital incentive program under § 495.104 of this part. In no event are EHR incentive payments made for a hospital for a payment year under this section to the extent they have been made for the same hospital for the same payment year under § 495.104 of this part.

        (f) Each qualifying MA organization must ensure that all potentially qualifying MA EPs are enumerated through the NPI system and that other identifying information required under § 495.202(b) is provided to CMS.

        § 495.211   Payment adjustments effective for 2015 and subsequent MA payment years with respect to MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals.

#### § § 495.211

        (a)  Beginning for MA payment adjustment year 2015, payment adjustments set forth in this section are made to prospective payments (issued under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act) of qualifying MA organizations that previously received incentive payments under the MA EHR Incentive Program, if all or a portion of the MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that would meet the definition of qualifying MA-EPs or qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals (but for their demonstration of meaningful use) are not meaningful EHR users.

        (b)  The payment adjustment is calculated based on the payment adjustment year.

        (c)  The payment adjustments identified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section are applied separately. Paragraph (d) of this section applies only to qualifying MA organizations that received payment for any MA payment year for qualifying MA EPs under § 495.204. Paragraph (e) of this section applies only to qualifying MA organizations that received payment for any MA payment year for qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under § 495.204.

        (d)  (1) For payment adjustment year 2015, and subsequent payment adjustment years, if a qualifying MA EP is not a meaningful EHR user during the payment adjustment year, CMS—

        (i) Determines a payment adjustment based on data from the payment adjustment year; and

        (ii) Collects the payment adjustment owed by adjusting a subsequent year's prospective payment or payments (issued under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act), or by otherwise collecting the payment adjustment, if, in the year of collection, the MA organization does not have an MA contract with CMS.

        (2) Beginning for payment adjustment year 2015, a qualifying MA organization that previously received incentive payments must, for each payment adjustment year, report to CMS the following:

        (3) The monthly prospective payment amount paid under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act for the payment adjustment year is adjusted by the product of—

        (i) The percent calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

        (ii) The Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion percent, which is CMS's estimate of proportion of expenditures under Parts A and B that are not attributable to Part C that are attributable to expenditures for physicians' services, adjusted for the proportion of expenditures that are provided by EPs that are neither qualifying nor potentially qualifying MA EPs with respect to a qualifying MA organization; and

        (iii) The applicable percent identified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

        (4)  The applicable percent is as follows:

        (i) For 2015, 1 percent;

        (ii) For 2016, 2 percent;

        (iii) For 2017, 3 percent.

        (iv) For 2018, 3 percent, except, in the case described in paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section, 4 percent.

        (v) For 2019 and each subsequent year, 3 percent, except, in the case described in paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section, the percent from the prior year plus 1 percent. In no case will the applicable percent be higher than 5 percent.

        (vi) Beginning with payment adjustment year 2018, if the percentage in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is more than 25 percent, the applicable percent is increased in accordance with paragraphs (d)(4)(iv) and (v) of this section.

        (e)  (1)(i) The payment adjustment set forth in this paragraph (e) applies if a qualifying MA organization that previously received an incentive payment (or a potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital on behalf of its qualifying MA organization) attests that a qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital is not a meaningful EHR user for a payment adjustment year.

        (ii) The payment adjustment is calculated by multiplying the qualifying MA organization's monthly prospective payment for the payment adjustment year under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act by the percent set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (2) The percent set forth in this paragraph (e) is the product of—

        (i) The percentage point reduction to the applicable percentage increase in the market basket index for the relevant Federal fiscal year as a result of § 412.64(d)(3) of this chapter;

        (ii) The Medicare Hospital Expenditure Proportion percent specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; and

        (iii) The percent of qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users. Qualifying MA organizations are required to report to CMS

        (3) The Medicare Hospital Expenditure Proportion for a year is the Secretary's estimate of expenditures under Parts A and B that are not attributable to Part C, that are attributable to expenditures for inpatient hospital services, adjusted for the proportion of expenditures that are provided by hospitals that are neither qualifying nor potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals with respect to a qualifying MA organization.

        (4) For MA payment adjustment years prior to 2022, subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals are neither potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals nor qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals for purposes of applying the payment adjustments under paragraph (e) of this section.

        (iv) Medicaid EPs may receive payments on a non-consecutive, annual basis.

        (v) No payments may be made after CY 2021.

        (3)  In no case may a Medicaid EP participate for more than a total of 6 years, and in no case will the maximum incentive over a 6-year period exceed $63,750.

        (4)  For a Medicaid EP who is a pediatrician described in paragraph (b) of this section payment is limited as follows:

        (i) The maximum payment in the first payment year is further reduced by two-thirds, which equals $14,167.

        (5) No hospital may begin receiving incentive payments for any year after FY 2016, and after FY 2016, a hospital may not receive an incentive payment unless it received an incentive payment in the prior fiscal year.

        (6) Prior to FY 2016, payments can be made to an eligible hospital on a non-consecutive, annual basis for the fiscal year.

        (7) A multi-site hospital with one CMS Certification Number is considered one hospital for purposes of calculating payment.

        (8) The aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount calculated under paragraph (g) of this section is determined by the State from which the eligible hospital receives its first payment year incentive. If a hospital receives incentive payments from other States in subsequent years, total incentive payments received over all payment years of the program can be no greater than the aggregate EHR incentive amount calculated by the initial State.

        (g)  The aggregate EHR hospital incentive amount is calculated as the product of the (overall EHR amount) times (the Medicaid Share).

        (1)  The overall EHR amount for an eligible hospital is based upon a theoretical 4 years of payment the hospital would receive based, for each of such 4 years, upon the product of the following:

        (i)  The initial amount is equal to the sum of—

        (A) The base amount which is set at $2,000,000 for each of the theoretical 4 years; plus

        (B) The discharge-related amount for the most recent continuous 12-month period selected by the State, but ending before the federal fiscal year that serves as the first payment year. The discharge-related amount is the sum of the following, with acute-care inpatient discharges over the 12-month period and based upon the total acute-care inpatient discharges for the eligible hospital (regardless of any source of payment):

        () For the first through _1_,149th acute-care inpatient discharge, $0.

        () For the 1,150th through the _2_3,000th acute-care inpatient discharge, $200.

        () For any acute-care inpatient discharge greater than the 2_3_,000th, $0.

        (C) For purposes of calculating the discharge-related amount under paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, for the last 3 of the theoretical 4 years of payment, acute-care inpatient discharges are assumed to increase by the provider's average annual rate of growth for the most recent 3 years for which data are available per year. Negative rates of growth must be applied as such.

        (ii)  The Medicare share, which equals 1.

        (iii)  The transition factor which equals as follows:

        (A) For the first of the theoretical 4 years, 1.

        (B) For the second of the theoretical 4 years,  .

        (C) For the third of the theoretical 4 years,  .

        (D) For the fourth of the theoretical 4 years,  .

        (2)  The Medicaid share specified under this paragraph for an eligible hospital is equal to a fraction—

        (i) The numerator of which is the sum (for the 12-month period selected by the State and with respect to the eligible hospital) of—

        (A) The estimated number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to Medicaid individuals; and

        (B) The estimated number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to individuals who are enrolled in a managed care organization, a pre-paid inpatient health plan, or a pre-paid ambulatory health plan under part 438 of this chapter; and

        (ii) The denominator of which is the product of—

        (A) The estimated total number of acute-care inpatient-bed-days with respect to the eligible hospital during such period; and

        (B) The estimated total amount of the eligible hospital's charges during such period, not including any charges that are attributable to charity care, divided by the estimated total amount of the hospital's charges during such period.

        (iii) In computing acute-care inpatient-bed-days under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, a State may not include estimated acute-care inpatient-bed-days attributable to individuals with respect to whom payment may be made under Medicare Part A, or acute-care inpatient-bed-days attributable to individuals who are enrolled with a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C.

        (h)  If the State determines that an eligible provider's data are not available on charity care necessary to calculate the portion of the formula specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the State may use that provider's data on uncompensated care to determine an appropriate proxy for charity care, but must include a downward adjustment to eliminate bad debt from uncompensated care data. The State must use auditable data sources.

        (i)  In the absence of the data necessary, with respect to an eligible hospital the amount described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section must be deemed to be 1. In the absence of data, with respect to an eligible hospital, necessary to compute the amount described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount under such clause must be deemed to be 0.

        (j)  A hospital may receive incentive payments from both Medicare and Medicaid if it meets all eligibility criteria in the payment year.

        (k)  Payments to entities promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology as designated by the State must meet the following requirements:

        (1) A Medicaid EP may reassign his or her incentive payment to an entity promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology, as defined in § 495.302, and as designated by the State, only under the following conditions:

        (i) The State has established a method to designate entities promoting the adoption of EHR technology that comports with the Federal definition in § 495.302.

        (ii) The State publishes and makes available to all EPs a voluntary mechanism for reassigning annual payments and includes information about the verification mechanism the State will use to ensure that the reassignment is voluntary and that no more than 5 percent of the annual payment is retained by the entity for costs not related to certified EHR technology.

        § 495.348   Procurement standards.

#### § § 495.348

        (a)  Procurements of HIT equipment and services are subject to the following procurement standards in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section regardless of any conditions for prior approval. These standards—

        (1) Include a requirement for maximum practical open and free competition regardless of whether the procurement is formally advertised or negotiated.

        (2) Are established to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in a cost effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders.

        (3) Apply when the cost of the procurement is treated as a direct cost of an award.

        (b)  The standards contained in this section do not relieve the Grantee of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s).

        (1) The grantee is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Departmental awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, and protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature.

        (2) Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

        (c)  The grantee must maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts.

        (2) Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, or any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award.

        (3) The officers, employees, and agents of the grantee must neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to sub agreements.

        (4) Grantees may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value.

        (5) The standards of conduct provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employers, or agents of the grantees.

        (d)  All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition.

        (1) The grantee must be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade.

        (2) In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft grant applications, or contract specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.

        (3) Awards must be made to the bidder or offer or whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the grantee, price, quality, and other factors considered.

        (4) Solicitations must clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offer or must fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the grantee.

        (5) Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the grantee's interest to do so.

        (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description must not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

        (ii) Requirements which the bidder or offer must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

        (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

        (iv) The specific features of brand name or equal descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.

        (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.

        (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.

        (4) Positive efforts must be made by grantees to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Grantees of Departmental awards must take all of the following steps to further this goal:

        (i) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.

        (ii) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

        (iv) Encourage contracting with consortia of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.

        (v) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

        (5) The type of procuring instruments used (for example, fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) must be determined by the grantee but must be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved.

        (6) The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting must not be used.

        (7) Contracts must be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement.

        (8) Consideration must be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.

        (9) In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” as described in 2 CFR part 376.

        (10) Some form of cost or price analysis must be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action.

        (11) Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices, and similar indicia, together with discounts.

        (12) Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability, and allowability.

        (13) Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must include the following at a minimum:

        (i) Basis for contractor selection.

        (ii) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained.

        (iii) Basis for award cost or price.

        (f)  A system for contract administration must be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases.

        (g)  The grantee must include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts, which must also be applied to subcontracts:

        (1) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

        (h)  Such contracts must describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

        (i)  All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the simplified acquisition threshold) awarded by grantees must include a provision to the effect that the grantee, the Departmental awarding agency, the U.S. Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, must have access to any books, documents, papers and records and staff of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

        (2) The finding that a prospective provider does not meet the conditions of participation set forth elsewhere in this chapter, if the prospective provider is, nevertheless, approved for participation in Medicare on the basis of special access certification, as provided in subpart B of part 488 of this chapter.

        (3) The refusal to enter into a provider agreement because the prospective provider is unable to give satisfactory assurance of compliance with the requirements of title XVIII of the Act.

        (13) The determination that requirements imposed on a State's laboratories under the laws of that State do not provide (or do not continue to provide) reasonable assurance that laboratories licensed or approved by the State meet applicable CLIA requirements.

        (14) The choice of alternative sanction or remedy to be imposed on a provider or supplier.

        (15) A decision by the State survey agency as to when to conduct an initial survey of a prospective provider or supplier.

      Subpart A—Loan Criteria

        § 505.1   Basis and scope.

#### § § 505.1

        This part implements section 1016 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) which amends section 1897 of the Act. Section 1897 of the Act as amended by section 6045 of the Tsunami Relief Act of 2005 authorizes the Secretary to establish a loan program by which qualifying hospitals may apply for a loan for the capital costs of the health care infrastructure improvement projects. Section 1897 of the Act appropriates $142,000,000 for the loan program including program administration. The funds are available beginning July 1, 2004 through September 30, 2008. This part sets forth the criteria that CMS uses to select among qualifying hospitals.

        § 505.3   Definitions.

#### § § 505.3

        For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

        means the project of a qualifying hospital that is designed to improve the health care infrastructure of the hospital, including construction, renovation, or other capital improvements.

        is an entity described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the code. An entity must also have at least one existing memorandum of understanding or affiliation agreement with a hospital located in the State in which the entity is located and retains clinical outpatient treatment for cancer on site as well as laboratory research, education, and outreach for cancer in the same facility.

        § 505.5   Loan criteria.

#### § § 505.5

        (a)  To qualify for the loan program, the applicant must meet the following conditions:

        (1) Meet the definition of a “qualifying hospital” as set forth in § 505.3 of this part.

        (2) Request a loan for the capital costs of an “eligible project” as defined in § 505.3 of this part. The capital costs for which a qualifying hospital may obtain a loan are limited to the reasonable costs incurred by the hospital, and capitalized on the Medicare cost report, for any facility or item of equipment that it has acquired the possession or use of at the time the loan funding is awarded.

        (b)  In selecting loan beneficiaries, CMS prioritizes qualifying hospitals that meet the following criteria:

        (1) The hospital is located in a State that, based on population density, is defined as a rural State. A rural State is one of ten States with the lowest population density. An applicant entity is required to be located in one of these ten States. The ten States are prioritized beginning with the State with the lowest population density. Population density is determined based on the most recent available U.S. Census Bureau data.

        (2) The hospital is located in a State with multiple Indian tribes in the State. After prioritizing based on paragraph (b)(1) of this section, States are further prioritized based on the States with the most Indian tribes. The number of Indian tribes in a State is based on the most recent data available published in “Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United State Bureau of Indian Affairs.” (68 FR 68180) published on December 5, 2003.

        (c) CMS will send written notice to qualifying hospitals that have been selected to participate in the loan program under this part.

        § 505.7   Terms of the loan.

#### § § 505.7

        All loan beneficiaries must agree to the following loan terms:

        (a)  An authorized official of a qualifying hospital must execute a promissory note, loan agreement, or a form approved by CMS and accompanied by any other documents CMS may designate. The loan beneficiary must provide required documentation in a timely manner.

        (b)  A loan beneficiary receives a lump sum distribution for which payment of principal and interest is deferred for 60 months beginning with the day of award notification from CMS. The loan repayment period is 20 years.

        (c)  In the event a loan beneficiary files for bankruptcy protection in a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise proves to be insolvent, CMS may terminate the deferment period described in paragraph (b) of this section and require immediate payment of the loan. If a loan beneficiary should file for bankruptcy protection in a court of competent jurisdiction or should otherwise evidence insolvency after the deferment period we will require immediate repayment of the outstanding principal and interest due. Those payments may be deducted from any Medicare payments otherwise due that hospital.

        (d)  CMS does not require a loan beneficiary to begin making payments of principal or interest at the end of the 60-month deferment period if it determines that the loan beneficiary meets the criteria for loan forgiveness under section 1897 of the Act, as determined by the Secretary.

        (e)  If a loan beneficiary fails to make any payment in repayment of a loan under this subpart within 10 days of its due date, the loan beneficiary may be considered to have defaulted on the loan. Upon default, all principal and accrued interest become due immediately, and CMS may require immediate payment of any outstanding principal and interest due. Those payments may be deducted from any Medicare payments otherwise due that hospital.

        (f)  The loan beneficiary must meet the following conditions:

        (1) Make payments every month for 20 years until the loan, including interest payments, are paid in full.

        (2) Pay interest on the unpaid principal until the full amount of principal has been paid.

        (3) Pay interest at a yearly rate based upon the rate as fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury and set forth at 45 CFR 30.13(a).

        (4) If a loan beneficiary fails to make any payment in repayment of a loan under this subpart within 10 days of its due date, that payment may be deducted from any Medicare payments otherwise due to the beneficiary.

        (g)  CMS calculates interest charges and payments consistent with § 405.378 of this chapter.

        (h)  A loan beneficiary has the right to make payments of principal at any time before they are due. A loan beneficiary may make full prepayment or partial prepayment without paying any prepayment charge. If a prepayment is made, the loan beneficiary must provide written notice to CMS at CMS, Division of Accounting Operations, P.O. Box 75120, Baltimore, MD 21207-0520.

        § 505.9   State and local permits.

#### § § 505.9

        With respect to an eligible project, the provision of a loan under this part shall not—

        (a) Relieve the beneficiary of the loan or any obligation to obtain any required State or local permit or approval with respect to the project.

        (b) Limit the right of any unit of State or local government to approve or regulate any rate of return on private equity invested in the project.

        (ii) Items or services for chronic conditions that may be affected by the LEJR procedure or post-surgical care would be related and included in the episode.

        (iii) Items and services for chronic conditions that are generally not affected by the LEJR procedure or post-surgical care would be excluded from the episode.

        (iv) Items and services for acute clinical conditions not arising from existing, episode-related chronic clinical conditions or complications of LEJR surgery would be excluded from the episode.

        (v) PBPM payments under CMS models determined to be primarily used for care coordination or care management services for clinical conditions in excluded categories of diagnoses, as described in § 510.200(d), would be excluded from the episode.

        (4) For performance years 1 through 5 only, CMS posts the following to the CMS website:

        (i) Potential revisions to the exclusion to allow for public comment; and

        (ii) An updated exclusions list after consideration of public comment.

        (5) For performance years 6 through 8, the list of excluded services posted on the CMS website as it appears at the beginning of performance year 5 will apply and will not be updated.

      Subpart D—Pricing and Payment

        § 510.300   Determination of episode quality-adjusted target prices.

#### § § 510.300

        (a)  CMS establishes episode quality-adjusted target prices for participant hospitals for each performance year or performance year subset of the model as specified in this section. Episode quality-adjusted target prices are established according to the following:

        (1)  MS-DRG assigned at discharge for anchor hospitalization and present of hip fracture diagnosis for anchor hospitalization—

        (i)(A) MS-DRG 469 with hip fracture; or

        (B) For episodes beginning on or after October 1, 2020, MS-DRG 521;

        (ii) MS-DRG 469 without hip fracture;

        (iii)(A) MS-DRG 470 with hip fracture; or

        (B) For episodes beginning on or after October 1, 2020, MS-DRG 522; or

        (iv) MS-DRG 470 without hip fracture.

        (2)  For performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1 only, episode quality-adjusted target prices are updated to account for Medicare payment updates no less than 2 times per year, for updated quality-adjusted target prices effective October 1 and January 1, and at other intervals if necessary.

        (3)  The quality-adjusted target price that applies to the episode is one of the following:

        (i) For episodes beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and ending on or before September 30, 2021, the date of admission for the anchor hospitalization.

        (ii) For episodes beginning on or after July 4, 2021 and ending on or after October 1, 2021, the date of the anchor procedure or the date of admission for the anchor hospitalization, as applicable.

        (4)  CMS develops a list of ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis codes that, when reported in the principal diagnosis code files on the claim for the anchor hospitalization or anchor procedure, represent a bone fracture for which a hip replacement procedure, either a partial hip arthroplasty or a total hip arthroplasty, could be the primary surgical treatment. The list of ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis codes used to identify hip fracture episodes can be found on the CMS website. Beginning on October 1, 2020, hip fracture episodes initiated by an anchor hospitalization will be identified by MS-DRGs 521 and 522.

        (i) For performance years 1 through 5 only, on an annual basis, or more frequently as needed, CMS updates the list of ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis codes to reflect coding changes or other issues brought to CMS' attention.

        (ii) For performance years 1 through 5 only, CMS applies the following standards when revising the list of ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis codes.

        (A) The ICD-CM diagnosis code is sufficiently specific that it represents a bone fracture for which a physician could determine that a hip replacement procedure, either a Partial Hip Arthroplasty (PHA) or a THA, could be the primary surgical treatment.

        (B) The ICD-CM diagnosis code is the primary reason (that is, principal diagnosis code) for the anchor hospitalization.

        (iii) For performance years 1 through 5 only, CMS posts the following to the CMS website:

        (A) Potential ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis codes for public comment; and

        (B) A final ICD-CM hip fracture diagnosis code list after consideration of public comment.

        (iv) For performance years 6 through 8, the hip fracture diagnosis code list posted at  as it appears at the beginning of performance year 5 will not be updated. The hip fracture diagnosis code list will be used to identify hip fracture episodes initiated by an anchor procedure in performance years 6 through 8.

        (5)  Quality-adjusted target prices reflect effective discount factors or applicable discount factors based on a hospital's composite quality score, as specified in §§ 510.300(c) and 510.315(f).

        (6) For episodes beginning on or after July 4, 2021 that are initiated by an anchor procedure, permitted OP TKAs and OP THAs are grouped with MS-DRG 470 or MS-DRG 522 episodes as follows:

        (i) Permitted OP THAs with hip fracture group with MS-DRG 522.

        (ii) Permitted OP THAs without hip fracture and permitted OP TKAs group with MS-DRG 470.

        (b)  (1) CMS calculates quality-adjusted target prices based on a blend of each participant hospital's hospital-specific and regional episode expenditures. The region corresponds to the U.S. Census Division associated with the primary address of the CCN of the participant hospital and the regional component is based on all hospitals in said region, except as follows. In cases where an MSA selected for participation in CJR spans more than one U.S. Census Division, the entire MSA will be grouped into the U.S. Census Division where the largest city by population in the MSA is located for quality-adjusted target price and reconciliation calculations. The calendar years used for historical expenditure calculations are as follows:

        (i) Episodes beginning in 2012 through 2014 for performance years 1 and 2.

        (ii) Episodes beginning in 2014 through 2016 for performance years 3 and 4.

        (iii) Episodes beginning in 2016 through 2018 for each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2.

        (iv) Episodes beginning in 2019 for performance year 6.

        (v) Episodes beginning in 2021 for performance year 7.

        (vi) Episodes beginning in 2022 for performance year 8.

        (2) Specifically, the blend consists of the following:

        (i) Two-thirds of the participant hospital's own historical episode payments and one-third of the regional historical episode payments for performance years 1 and 2.

        (ii) One-third of the hospital's own historical episode payments and two-thirds of the regional historical episode payments for performance year 3.

        (iii) Regional historical episode payments for performance year 4, for each subset of performance year 5, and performance years 6 through 8.

        (3)  Quality-adjusted target prices for participant hospitals with fewer than 20 CJR episodes in total across the 3 historical years of data used to calculate the quality-adjusted target price are based on 100 percent regional historical episode payments.

        (4)  Hospital-specific historical episode payments for participant hospitals that have undergone a merger, consolidation, spin off or other reorganization that results in a new hospital entity without 3 full years of historical claims data are determined using the historical episode payments attributed to their predecessor(s).

        (5)  (i) For performance years 1 through 4, and for performance year 5, each subset thereof, episode payments are capped at 2 standard deviations above the mean regional episode payment for both the hospital-specific and regional components of the quality-adjusted target price.

        (ii) For performance years 6 through 8, episode payments are capped at the 99th percentile of regional spending for each of the four MS-DRG categories, as specified in § 510.300(a)(1) and (6).

        (6)  Certain incentive programs and add-on payments are excluded from historical episode payments by using, with certain modifications, the CMS Price (Payment) Standardization Detailed Methodology used for the Medicare spending per beneficiary measure in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program.

        (7)  CMS communicates episode quality-adjusted target prices to participant hospitals before the performance period in which they apply.

        (8)  For performance years 3, 4, and each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2 only, reconciliation payments and repayment amounts under § 510.305(f)(2) and (3) and from LEJR episodes included in the BPCI initiative are included in historical episode payments.

        (c)  A participant hospital's episode quality-adjusted target prices incorporate discount factors to reflect Medicare's portion of reduced expenditures from the CJR model as described in this section.

        (1)  In all performance years and performance year subsets, the discount factor may be affected by the quality incentive payment and composite quality score as provided in § 510.315 to create the effective discount factor or applicable discount factor used for calculating reconciliation payments and repayment amounts. The quality-adjusted target prices incorporate the effective or applicable discount factor at reconciliation.

        (2)  The discount factor for reconciliation payments in all performance years and performance year subsets is 3.0 percent.

        (3)  The discount factor for repayment amounts is—

        (i) Not applicable in performance year 1, as the requirement for hospital repayment under the CJR model is waived in performance year 1;

        (ii) In performance years 2 and 3, 2.0 percent; and

        (iii) In performance years 4, each subset of performance year 5, and performance years 6 through 8, 3.0 percent.

        (d)  (1) CMS makes available to participant hospitals, through the most appropriate means, data that CMS determines may be useful to participant hospitals to do the following:

        (i) Determine appropriate ways to increase the coordination of care.

        (ii) Improve quality.

        (iii) Enhance efficiencies in the delivery of care.

        (iv) Otherwise achieve the goals of the CJR model described in this section.

        (2)  (i) CMS makes beneficiary-identifiable data available to a participant hospital in accordance with applicable privacy laws and only in response to the hospital's request for such data for a beneficiary who has been furnished a billable service by the participant hospital corresponding to the episode definitions for CJR.

        (ii) The minimum data necessary to achieve the goals of the CJR model, as determined by CMS, may be provided under this section for a participant hospital's baseline period and no less frequently than on a quarterly basis throughout the hospital's participation in the CJR model.

> [80 FR 73540, Nov. 24, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 11451, Mar. 4, 2016; 82 FR 613, Jan. 3, 2017; 82 FR 57104, Dec. 1, 2017; 85 FR 71199, Nov. 6, 2020; 86 FR 23571, May 3, 2021]

        § 510.301   Determination of reconciliation target prices.

#### § § 510.301

        Beginning with performance year 6, the quality-adjusted target price computed under § 510.300 is further adjusted for risk and market trends as described in this section to arrive at the reconciliation target price amount, with the exception of episodes that are reconciled in performance year 6 but subject to a performance year subset 5.2 target price. Specifically:

        (a)  (1) The quality-adjusted target prices computed under § 510.300 are risk adjusted at a beneficiary level by a CJR HCC count risk adjustment factor, an age bracket risk adjustment factor, and a dual-eligibility status risk adjustment factor. All three factors are binary, yes/no variables, meaning that a beneficiary either does or does not meet the criteria for a specific variable.

        (i) The CJR HCC count risk adjustment factor uses five variables, representing beneficiaries with zero, one, two, three, or four or more CMS-HCC conditions.

        (ii) The age bracket risk adjustment factor uses four variables, representing beneficiaries aged—

        (A) Less than 65 years;

        (B) 65 to 74 years;

        (C) 75 years to 84 years; or

        (D) 85 years or more.

        (iii) The dual-eligibility status factor uses two variables, representing beneficiaries that are eligible for full Medicaid benefits or beneficiaries that are not eligible for full Medicaid benefits.

        (2) All three factors are computed prior to the start of performance years 6 and 8 via a linear regression analysis. The regression analysis is computed using 1 year of claims data as follows:

        (i) For performance year 6, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

        (ii) For performance year 7, CMS uses the same regression analysis results and corresponding coefficients that were calculated for performance year 6.

        (iii) For performance year 8, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

        (3)(i) The dependent variable in the annual regression that produces the risk adjustment coefficients is equal to the difference between the log transformed target price calculated under § 510.300 and the capped episode costs as described in § 510.300(b)(5)(ii).

        (ii) The independent variables are binary values assigned to each CJR HCC count variable, age bracket variable and dual-eligibility status variable.

        (iii) Using these variables, the annual regression produces exponentiated coefficients to determine the anticipated marginal effect of each risk adjustment factor on episode costs. CMS transforms, or exponentiate, these coefficients in order to “reverse” the previous logarithmic transformation, and the resulting coefficients are the CJR HCC count risk adjustment factor, the age bracket risk adjustment factor, and the dual-eligibility status factor that would be used during reconciliation for the subsequent performance year.

        (4)(i) At the time of reconciliation, the quality adjusted target prices computed under § 510.300 are risk adjusted at the beneficiary level by applying the applicable CJR HCC count risk adjustment factor, the age bracket risk adjustment factor, and the dual-eligibility risk adjustment factor specific to the beneficiary in the episode.

        (ii)(A) For the CJR HCC count risk adjustment factor, applicable means the coefficient that applies to the CMS-HCC condition count for the beneficiary in the episode;

        (B) For the age bracket risk adjustment factor, applicable means the coefficient for the age bracket into which the beneficiary falls on the first day of the episode; and

        (C) For the dual-eligibility risk adjustment factor, applicable means the coefficient for beneficiaries that are eligible for full Medicaid benefits on the first day of the episode.

        (5)(i) The risk-adjusted target prices are normalized at reconciliation to remove the overall impact of adjusting for age, CJR HCC count, and dual-eligibility status on the national average target price.

        (ii) The normalization factor is the national mean of the target price for all episode types divided by the national mean of the risk-adjusted target price.

        (iii) CMS applies the normalization factor to the previously calculated, beneficiary-level, risk-adjusted target prices specific to each episode region and MS-DRG combination (as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section).

        (iv) These normalized target prices are then further adjusted for market trends (as specified in paragraph (b) of this section) and quality performance (as specified at § 510.300) to become the reconciliation target prices, which are compared to actual episode costs at reconciliation, as specified in § 510.305(m)(1)(i).

        (b)  (1) The risk-adjusted quality-adjusted target price computed under § 510.300 and paragraph (a) of this section is further adjusted for market trend changes at the region and MS-DRG level.

        (2) This adjustment is accomplished by multiplying each risk-adjusted quality-adjusted target price computed under § 510.300 and paragraph (a) of this section by the applicable market trend adjustment factor.

        (3) The applicable market trend adjustment factor is calculated as the percent difference between the average regional MS-DRG episode costs computed using the performance year claims data and comparison average regional MS-DRG fracture episode costs computed using historical calendar year claims data used to calculate the regional target prices in effect for that performance year.

        § 510.305   Determination of the NPRA and reconciliation process.

#### § § 510.305

        (a)  Providers and suppliers furnishing items and services included in the episode bill for such items and services in accordance with existing rules and as if this part were not in effect.

        (b)  (1) For performance years 1 through 4 and for each subset of performance year 5, CMS uses a series of reconciliation processes, which CMS performs as described in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section after the end of each performance year, to establish final payment amounts to participant hospitals for CJR model episodes for a given performance year.

        (2) For performance years 6 through 8, CMS conducts one reconciliation process, which CMS performs as described in paragraphs (l) and (m) of this section after the end of each performance year, to establish final payment amounts to participant hospitals for CJR model episodes for a given performance year.

        (3) Following the end of each performance year, for performance years 1 through 4 and for performance year 5, each subset thereof, CMS determines actual episode payments for each episode for the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) and determines the amount of a reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

        (c)  CMS uses the most recent claims data available to perform each reconciliation calculation.

        (d)  (1) Beginning 2 months after the end of each of performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1 and 5 months after the end of performance year subset 5.2, CMS does all of the following:

        (i) Performs a reconciliation calculation to establish an NPRA for each participant hospital.

        (ii) For participant hospitals that experience a reorganization event in which one or more hospitals reorganize under the CCN of a participant hospital performs—

        (A) Separate reconciliation calculations (during both initial and subsequent reconciliations for a performance year) for each predecessor participant hospital for episodes where anchor hospitalization admission occurred before the effective date of the reorganization event; and

        (B) Reconciliation calculations (during both initial and subsequent reconciliations for a performance year) for each new or surviving participant hospital for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission occurred on or after the effective date of the reorganization event.

        (2) CMS—

        (i) Calculates the NPRA for each participant hospital in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section including the adjustments provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section; and

        (ii) Assesses whether hospitals meet specified quality requirements under § 510.315.

        (e)  By comparing the quality-adjusted target prices described in § 510.300 and the participant hospital's actual episode spending for each of performance years 1 through 4, and for performance year 5, each subset thereof, and applying the adjustments in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, CMS establishes an NPRA for each participant hospital for each of performance years 1 through 4 and for performance year 5, each subset thereof.

        (1)  In calculating the NPRA for each participant hospital for each of performance years 1 through 4 and each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, CMS does the following:

        (i) Determines actual episode payments for each episode included in the performance year or performance year subset (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) using claims data that is available 2 months after the end of the performance year or performance year subset. Actual episode payments are capped, as applicable, at the amount determined in accordance with § 510.300(b)(5) for the performance year or performance year subset at the amount determined in paragraph (k) of this section for episodes affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, or at the quality adjusted target price determined for that episode under § 510.300 for an episode with actual episode payments that include a claim with a COVID-19 diagnosis code and initiate after the earlier of March 31, 2021 or the last day of the emergency period described in paragraph (k)(4) of this section.

        (ii) Multiplies each episode quality-adjusted target price by the number of episodes included in the performance year or performance year subset (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) to which that episode quality-adjusted target price applies.

        (iii) Aggregates the amounts computed in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section for all episodes included in the performance year or performance year subset (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)).

        (iv) Subtracts the amount determined under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

        (v) Applies the following prior to determination of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount:

        (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(v)(C) of this section, the total amount of the NPRA and subsequent reconciliation calculation for a performance year or performance year subset cannot exceed the following:

        () For performance year 2 only, 5 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(_1_)(iii) of this section for the performance year.

        () For performance year 3, 10 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year.

        () For performance year 4 and each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year or performance year subset.

        () As provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the subsequent reconciliation calculation reassesses the limitation on loss for a given performance year by applying the limitations on loss to the aggregate of the 2 reconciliation calculations.

        () The post-episode spending and ACO overlap calculation amounts in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section are not subject to the limitation on loss.

        (B)  The total amount of the NPRA and subsequent reconciliation calculation for a performance year or performance year subset cannot exceed the following:

        () For performance years _1_ and 2, 5 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year.

        () For performance year 3, 10 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year.

        () For performance year 4 and each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year or performance year subset.

        () As provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the subsequent reconciliation calculation reassesses the limitation on gain for a given performance year by applying the limitations on gain to the aggregate of the 2 reconciliation calculations.

        () The post-episode spending and ACO overlap calculation amounts in paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(2) of this section are not subject to the limitation on gain.

        (C)  If a participant hospital is a rural hospital, SCH, MDH, or RRC, then for performance year 2, the total repayment amount for which the participant hospital is responsible due to the NPRA and subsequent reconciliation calculation cannot exceed 3 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. For performance years 3 and 4 and for performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, the amount cannot exceed 5 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

        (f) —(1)  (i) Subject to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, for performance year 1, the reconciliation payment (if any) is equal to the NPRA.

        (ii) Subject to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, for performance years 2 through 4 and for each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, results from the subsequent reconciliation calculation for a prior year's reconciliation as described in paragraph (i) of this section and the post-episode spending and ACO overlap calculations as described in paragraph (j) of this section are added to the current year's NPRA in order to determine the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

        (iii) The reconciliation or repayment amount may be adjusted as provided in § 510.410(b).

        (iv) Results from the performance year 6 reconciliation and post-episode spending calculations as described in paragraph (m) of this section are added together in order to determine the reconciliation payment or repayment amount for performance year 6.

        (v) Results from the performance year 7 reconciliation and post-episode spending calculations as described in paragraph (m) of this section are added together in order to determine the reconciliation payment or repayment amount for performance year 7.

        (vi) Results from the performance year 8 reconciliation and post-episode spending calculations as described in paragraph (m) of this section are added together in order to determine the reconciliation payment or repayment amount for performance year 8.

        (2)  If the amount described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is positive and the composite quality score described in § 510.315 is acceptable (defined as greater than or equal to 5.00 and less than 6.9), good (defined as greater than or equal to 6.9 and less than or equal to 15.0), or excellent (defined as greater than 15.0), Medicare pays the participant hospital a reconciliation payment in an amount equal to the amount described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

        (3)  If the amount described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is negative, the participant hospital pays to Medicare an amount equal to the amount described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in accordance with § 405.371 of this chapter. CMS waives this requirement for performance year 1.

        (g)  (1) CMS assesses each participant hospital's performance on quality metrics, as described in § 510.315, to determine whether the participant hospital is eligible to receive a reconciliation payment for a performance year or performance year subset.

        (2) If the hospital's composite quality score described in § 510.315 is acceptable (defined as greater than or equal to 5.00 and less than 6.9), good (defined as greater than or equal to 6.9 and less than or equal to 15.0), or excellent (defined as greater than 15.0), and the hospital is determined to have a positive NPRA under § 510.305(e)), the hospital is eligible for a reconciliation payment.

        (3) If the hospital's composite quality score described in § 510.315 is below acceptable, defined as less than 4.00 for a performance year or performance year subset, the hospital is not eligible for a reconciliation payment.

        (4) If the hospital is found to be engaged in an inappropriate and systemic under delivery of care, the quality of the care provided must be considered to be seriously compromised and the hospital must be ineligible to receive or retain a reconciliation payment for any period in which such under delivery of care was found to occur.

        (h)  CMS issues each participant hospital a CJR reconciliation report for the performance year or performance year subset. Each CJR reconciliation report contains the following:

        (1) Information on the participant hospital's composite quality score described in § 510.315.

        (2) The total actual episode payments for the participant hospital.

        (3) The NPRA.

        (4) Whether the participant hospital is eligible for a reconciliation payment or must make a repayment to Medicare.

        (5) As applicable, the NPRA and subsequent reconciliation calculation amount for the previous performance year or performance year subset.

        (6) As applicable, the post-episode spending amount and ACO overlap calculation for the previous performance year or performance year subset.

        (7) The reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

        (i)  (1) Fourteen months after the end of each of performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1 and seventeen months after the end of performance year subset 5.2, CMS performs an additional calculation, using claims data available at that time, to account for final claims run-out and any additional episode cancelations due to overlap between the CJR model and other CMS models and programs, or for other reasons as specified in § 510.210(b).

        (2) The subsequent calculation for each of performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1 occurs concurrently with the first reconciliation process for the following performance year (or in the case of performance year subset 5.1, with the first reconciliation of performance year subset 5.2). If the result of the subsequent calculation is different than zero, CMS applies the stop-loss and stop-gain limits in paragraph (e) of this section to the aggregate calculation of the amounts described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (i)(1) of this section for that performance year or performance year subset (the initial reconciliation and the subsequent reconciliation calculation) to ensure such amount does not exceed the applicable stop-loss or stop-gain limits. The subsequent reconciliation calculation for performance year subset 5.2 will occur independently in 2023.

        (j)  (1) In order to account for shared savings payments, CMS will reduce the reconciliation payment or increase the repayment amount for the subsequent performance year (for performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1) by the amount of the participant hospital's discount percentage that is paid to the ACO in the prior performance year as shared savings. (This amount will be assessed independently for performance year subset 5.2 in 2023.) This adjustment is made only when the participant hospital is a participant or provider/supplier in the ACO and the beneficiary in the CJR episode is assigned to one of the following ACO models or programs:

        (i) The Pioneer ACO model.

        (ii) The Medicare Shared Savings Program (excluding Track 3 for CJR episodes that initiate on or after July 1, 2017).

        (iii) The Comprehensive ESRD Care Initiative (excluding a track with downside risk for CJR episodes that initiate after July 1, 2017).

        (iv) The Next Generation ACO model (excluding CJR episodes that initiate on or after July 1, 2017).

        (2) If the average post-episode Medicare Parts A and B payments for a participant hospital in the prior performance year or performance year subset is greater than 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for the same performance year or performance year subset, then the spending amount exceeding 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for the same performance year or performance year subset is subtracted from the net reconciliation or added to the repayment amount for the subsequent performance year for years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1, and assessed independently for performance year subset 5.2.

        (k)  (1) The episode spending adjustments specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section apply for a participant hospital that has a CCN primary address that meets both of the following:

        (i) Is located in an emergency area during an emergency period, as those terms are defined in section 1135(g) of the Act, for which the Secretary has issued a waiver under section 1135; and

        (ii) Is located in a county, parish, or tribal government designated in a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act.

        (2)(i) For a non-fracture episode with a date of admission to the anchor hospitalization that is on or within 30 days before the date that the emergency period (as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act) begins, actual episode payments are capped at the target price determined for that episode under § 510.300.

        (ii) For a fracture episode with a date of admission to the anchor hospitalization that is on or within 30 days before or after the date that the emergency period (as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act) begins, actual episode payments are capped at the target price determined for that episode under § 510.300.

        (3) The following is an extreme and uncontrollable circumstances adjustment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (previously referred to as 2019-nCoV, now as COVID-19):

        (i) The episode spending adjustments specified in paragraph (k)(4) of this section apply for a participant hospital that has a CCN primary address that is located in an emergency area during an emergency period, as those terms are defined in section 1135(g) of the Act, for which the Secretary issued a waiver or modification of requirements under section 1135 of the Act on March 13, 2020.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (4) For a fracture or non-fracture episode with a date of admission to the anchor hospitalization that is on or within 30 days before the date that the emergency period (as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act) begins or that occurs on or before March 31, 2021 or the last day of such emergency period, whichever is earlier, actual episode payments are capped at the quality adjusted target price determined for that episode under § 510.300.

        (l)  (1) Beginning 6 months after the end of each of performance years 6 through 8, CMS does all of the following:

        (i) Performs a reconciliation calculation to establish an NPRA for each participant hospital.

        (ii) For participant hospitals that experience a reorganization event in which one or more hospitals reorganize under the CCN of a participant hospital, performs—

        (A) Separate reconciliation calculations for each predecessor participant hospital for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or the anchor procedure occurred before the effective date of the reorganization event; and

        (B) Reconciliation calculations for each new or surviving participant hospital for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or anchor procedure occurred on or after the effective date of the reorganization event.

        (2) CMS—

        (i) Calculates the NPRA for each participant hospital in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section including the adjustments provided for in paragraph (m)(1)(vii) of this section; and

        (ii) Assesses whether participant hospitals meet specified quality requirements under § 510.315.

        (m)  By comparing the reconciliation target prices described in § 510.301 and the participant hospital's actual episode spending for the performance year and applying the adjustments in paragraph (m)(1)(vii) of this section, CMS establishes an NPRA for each participant hospital for each of performance years 6 through 8.

        (1) In calculating the NPRA for each participant hospital for each performance year, CMS does the following:

        (i) Determines actual episode payments for each episode included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) using claims data that is available 6 months after the end of the performance year. Actual episode payments are capped at the amount determined in accordance with § 510.300(b)(5)(ii) for the performance year, the amount determined in paragraph (k) of this section for episodes affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, or the target price determined for that episode under § 510.300 for episodes that contain a COVID-19 Diagnosis Code as defined in § 510.2.

        (ii) Multiplies each episode reconciliation target price by the number of episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) to which that episode reconciliation target price applies.

        (iii) Aggregates the amounts computed in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section for all episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)).

        (iv) Subtracts the amount determined under paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section.

        (v) Performs an additional calculation using claims data available at that time, to account for any episode cancelations due to overlap between the CJR model and other CMS models and programs, or for other reasons as specified in § 510.210(b).

        (vi) Conducts a post-episode spending calculation as follows: If the average post-episode Medicare Parts A and B payments for a participant hospital in the performance year being reconciled is greater than 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for that same performance year, then the spending amount exceeding 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for the same performance year is subtracted from the net reconciliation or added to the repayment for that performance year.

        (vii) Applies the following prior to determination of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount:

        (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (m)(1)(vii)(C) of this section, the total amount of the NPRA for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year. The post-episode spending calculation amount in paragraph (m)(vi) of this section is not subject to the limitation on loss.

        (B)  The total amount of the NPRA for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section for the performance year. The post-episode spending calculation amount in paragraph (m)(vi) of this section are not subject to the limitation on gain.

        (C)  Financial loss limits for rural hospitals, SCHs, MDHs, and RRCs for performance years 6 through 8. If a participant hospital is a rural hospital, SCH, MDH, or RRC, the amount cannot exceed 5 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section.

        (2) [Reserved]

        § 510.310   Appeals process.

#### § § 510.310

        (a)  Subject to the limitations on review in subpart D of this part, if a participant hospital wishes to dispute calculations involving a matter related to payment, reconciliation amounts, repayment amounts, the use of quality measure results in determining the composite quality score, or the application of the composite quality score during reconciliation, the participant hospital is required to provide written notice of the calculation error, in a form and manner specified by CMS.

        (1) Unless the participant hospital provides such notice, CMS deems final the CJR reconciliation report 45 calendar days after it is issued and proceeds with the payment or repayment processes as applicable.

        (2) If CMS receives a notice of a calculation error within 45 calendar days of the issuance of the reconciliation report, CMS responds in writing within 30 calendar days to either confirm that there was an error in the calculation or verify that the calculation is correct, although CMS reserves the right to an extension upon written notice to the participant hospital.

        (3) Only participant hospitals may use the dispute resolution process described in this part.

        (4) Only participant hospitals may use the notice of calculation error process described in this part.

        (b)  (1) If the participant hospital is dissatisfied with CMS's response to the notice of a calculation error, the participant hospital may request a reconsideration review in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

        (2) The reconsideration review request must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute and include supporting documentation for the participant hospital's assertion that CMS or its representatives did not accurately calculate the NPRA, the reconciliation payment, or the repayment amount in accordance with § 510.305.

        (3) If CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the participant hospital within 10 calendar days of the issue date of CMS's response to the participant hospital's notice of calculation error, then CMS's response to the calculation error is deemed final and CMS proceeds with reconciliation payment or repayment processes, as applicable, as described in § 510.305.

        (4) A CMS reconsideration official notifies the participant hospital in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the participant hospital's review request of the following:

        (i) The issues in dispute.

        (ii) The review procedures.

        (iii) The procedures (including format and deadlines) for submission of briefs and evidence.

        (5) The provisions at § 425.804(b), (c), and (e) of this chapter are applicable to reviews conducted in accordance with the reconsideration review process for CJR.

        (6) The CMS reconsideration official makes all reasonable efforts to issue a written determination within 30 days of the deadline for submission of briefs and evidence. The determination is final and binding.

        (c)  If the participant hospital contests a matter that does not involve an issue contained in, or a calculation that contributes to, a CJR reconciliation report, a notice of calculation error is not required. In these instances, if CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the participant hospital within 10 calendar days of the notice of the initial determination, the initial determination is deemed final and CMS proceeds with action indicated in the initial determination. This does not apply to the limitations on review in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (d)  If a participant hospital receives notification that it has been terminated from the CJR model, it must provide a written notice to CMS requesting review of the termination within 10 calendar days of the notice. CMS has 30 days to respond to the participant hospital's request for review. If the participant hospital fails to notify CMS, the termination is deemed final.

        (e)  In accordance with section 1115A(d)(2) of the Act, there is no administrative or judicial review under sections 1869 or 1878 of the Act or otherwise for the following:

        (1) The selection of models for testing or expansion under section 1115A of the Act.

        (2) The selection of organizations, sites, or participants to test those models selected.

        (3) The elements, parameters, scope, and duration of such models for testing or dissemination.

        (4) Determinations regarding budget neutrality under section 1115A(b)(3) of Act.

        (5) The termination or modification of the design and implementation of a model under section 1115A(b)(3)(B) of Act.

        (6) Decisions about expansion of the duration and scope of a model under section 1115A(c) of the Act, including the determination that a model is not expected to meet criteria described in section 1115A(c)(1) or (2) of the Act.

> [80 FR 73540, Nov. 24, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 615, Jan. 3, 2017; 86 FR 23573, May 3, 2021]

        § 510.315   Composite quality scores for determining reconciliation payment eligibility and quality incentive payments.

#### § § 510.315

        (a)  A participant hospital's eligibility for a reconciliation payment under § 510.305(g), and the determination of quality incentive payments under paragraph (f) of this section, for a performance year or performance year subset depend on the hospital's composite quality score (including any quality performance points and quality improvement points earned) for that performance year or performance year subset.

        (b)  CMS calculates a composite quality score for each participant hospital for each performance year or performance year subset which equals the sum of the following:

        (1) The hospital's quality performance points for the hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate following elective primary total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty measure (NQF #1550) described in § 510.400(a)(1). This measure is weighted at 50 percent of the composite quality score.

        (2) The hospital's quality performance points for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey measure (NQF #0166) described in § 510.400(a)(2). This measure is weighted at 40 percent of the composite quality score.

        (3) Any additional quality improvement points the hospital may earn as a result of demonstrating improvement on either or both of the quality measures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (4) If applicable, 2 additional points for successful THA/TKA voluntary data submission of patient-reported outcomes and limited risk variable data, as described in § 510.400(b). Successful submission is weighted at 10 percent of the composite quality score.

        (c)  CMS computes quality performance points for each quality measure based on the participant hospital's performance relative to the distribution of performance of all subsection (d) hospitals that are eligible for payment under IPPS and meet the minimum patient case or survey count for that measure.

        (1) For the hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate following elective primary total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty measure (NQF #1550) described in § 510.400(a)(1), CMS assigns the participant hospital measure value to a performance percentile and then quality performance points are assigned based on the following performance percentile scale:

        (i) 10.00 points for ≥90th.

        (ii) 9.25 points for ≥80th and <90th.

        (iii) 8.50 points for ≥70th and <80th;

        (iv) 7.75 points for ≥60th and <70th.

        (v) 7.00 points for ≥50th and <60th.

        (vi) 6.25 points for ≥40th and <50th.

        (vii) 5.50 points for ≥30th and <40th.

        (viii) 0.0 points for <30th.

        (2) For the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey measure (NQF #0166) described in § 510.400(a)(2), CMS assigns the participant hospital measure value to a performance percentile and quality performance points are assigned based on the following performance percentile scale:

        (i) 8.00 points for ≥90th.

        (ii) 7.40 points for ≥80th and <90th.

        (iii) 6.80 points for ≥70th and <80th.

        (iv) 6.20 points for ≥60th and <70th.

        (v) 5.60 points for ≥50th and <60th.

        (vi) 5.00 points for ≥40th and <50th.

        (vii) 4.40 points for ≥30th and <40th.

        (viii) 0.0 points for <30th.

        (d)  (1) For performance year 1, if a participant hospital's quality performance percentile on an individual measure described in § 510.400(a) increases from the corresponding time period in the previous year by at least 2 deciles on the performance percentile scale, then the hospitals is eligible to receive quality improvement points equal to 10 percent of the total available point for that individual measure up to a maximum composite quality score of 20 points.

        (2) For each of performance years 2 through 4, each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2, and each of performance years 6 through 8, if a participant hospital's quality performance percentile on an individual measure described in § 510.400(a) increases from the previous performance year or performance year subset by at least 2 deciles on the performance percentile scale, then the hospital is eligible to receive quality improvement points equal to 10 percent of the total available point for that individual measure up to a maximum composite quality score of 20 points.

        (e) In the case of a participant hospital without a measure value that would allow CMS to assign quality performance points for that quality measure, CMS assigns the 50th percentile quality performance points to the hospital for the individual measure.

        (1) A participant hospital will not have a measure value for the—

        (i) Hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate following elective primary total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty measure (NQF #1550) described in § 510.400(a)(1) if the hospital does not meet the minimum 25 case count; or

        (ii) Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey measure (NQF #0166) described in § 510.400(a)(2) if the hospital does not meet the minimum of 100 completed survey and does not have 4 consecutive quarters of HCAHPS data.

        (ii) For either of the measures described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, if CMS identifies an error in the data used to calculate the measure and suppresses the measure value.

        (f)  CMS provides incentive payments to participant hospitals that demonstrate good or excellent quality performance on the composite quality scores described in paragraph (b) of this section. These incentive payments are implemented in the form of the following reductions to the effective discount factors or applicable discount factors described in § 510.300(c):

        (1)  For performance years 1 through 5—

        (i) A 1.0 percentage point reduction to the effective discount factor or applicable discount factor for participant hospitals with good quality performance, defined as composite quality scores that are greater than or equal to 6.9 and less than or equal to 15.0; or

        (ii) A 1.5 percentage point reduction to the effective discount factor or applicable discount factor for participant hospitals with excellent quality performance, defined as composite quality scores that are greater than 15.0.

        (2)  For performance years 6 through 8—

        (i) A 1.5-percentage point reduction to the effective discount factor or applicable discount factor for participant hospitals with good quality performance, defined as composite quality scores that are greater than or equal to 6.9 and less than or equal to 15.0; or

        (ii) A 3-percentage point reduction to the effective discount factor or applicable discount factor for participant hospitals with excellent quality performance, defined as composite quality scores that are greater than 15.0.

> [80 FR 73540, Nov. 24, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 615, Jan. 3, 2017; 85 FR 71201, Nov. 6, 2020; 86 FR 23573, May 3, 2021]

        § 510.320   Treatment of incentive programs or add-on payments under existing Medicare payment systems.

#### § § 510.320

        The CJR model does not replace any existing Medicare incentive programs or add-on payments. The target price and NPRA for a participant hospital are independent of, and do not affect, any incentive programs or add-on payments under existing Medicare payment systems.

        § 510.325   Allocation of payments for services that straddle the episode.

#### § § 510.325

        (a)  Services included in the episode that straddle the episode are prorated so that only the portion attributable to care furnished during the episode are included in the calculation of actual episode payments.

        (b)  Payments for services that straddle the episode are prorated using the following methodology:

        (1)  Non-IPPS inpatient services, and services furnished by other inpatient providers that extend beyond the end of the episode are prorated according to the percentage of the actual length of stay (in days) that falls within the episode.

        (2)  Home health services paid under the prospective payment system in part 484, subpart E of this chapter are prorated according to the percentage of days, starting with the first billable service date (“start of care date”) and through and including the last billable service date, that occur during the episode. This methodology is applied in the same way if the home health services begin (the start of care date) prior to the start of the episode.

        (3)  IPPS claim amounts that extend beyond the end of the episode are prorated according to the geometric mean length of stay, using the following methodology:

        (i) The first day of the IPPS stay is counted as 2 days.

        (ii) If the actual length of stay that occurred during the episode is equal to or greater than the MS-DRG geometric mean, the normal MS-DRG payment is fully allocated to the episode.

        (iii) If the actual length of stay that occurred during the episode is less than the geometric mean, the normal MS-DRG payment amount is allocated to the episode based on the number of inpatient days that fall within the episode.

        (iv) If the full amount is not allocated to the episode, any remainder amount is allocated to the post-episode spending calculation (defined in § 510.2).

      Subpart E—Quality Measures, Beneficiary Protections, and Compliance Enforcement

        § 510.400   Quality measures and reporting.

#### § § 510.400

        (a)  The following quality measures are used for public reporting, for determining whether a participant hospital is eligible for reconciliation payments under § 510.305(g), and whether a participant hospital is eligible for quality incentive payments under § 510.315(f) in the performance year or performance year subset:

        (1) Hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate following elective primary total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty.

        (2) Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey.

        (b)  To be eligible to receive the additional points added to the composite quality score for successful voluntary data submission of patient-reported outcomes and limited risk variable data, as described in § 510.315(b)(4), participant hospitals must submit the THA/TKA patient-reported outcome and limited risk variable data requested by CMS related to the pre- and post-operative periods for elective primary total hip and/or total knee arthroplasty procedures. The data must be submitted within 60 days of the end of the most recent performance period and be accompanied by the patient-reported outcomes and limited risk variable data (eleven elements finalized) as outlined in § 510.315(b)(4).

        (1) For each eligible procedure all eleven risk variable data elements are required to be submitted. The eleven risk variables are as follows:

        (i) Date of birth.

        (ii) Race.

        (iii) Ethnicity.

        (iv) Date of admission to anchor hospitalization.

        (v) Date of eligible THA/TKA procedure.

        (vi) Medicare Health Insurance Claim Number.

        (vii) Body mass index.

        (viii) Use of chronic (≥90 day) narcotics.

        (ix) Total painful joint count.

        (x) Quantified spinal pain.

        (xi) Single Item Health Literacy Screening (SILS2) questionnaire.

        (2) Hospitals must also submit the amount of requested THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes data required for each performance year or performance year subset of the model in order to be considered successful in submitting voluntary data.

        (i) The amount of requested THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes data to submit, in order to be considered successful will increase each subsequent year of the model over the first 5 years of the model (with the exception of performance year subset 5.2, for which CMS will request the same amount of THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes data as performance year subset 5.1, updated to reflect the timeframe applicable to performance year subset 5.2).

        (ii) A phase-in approach that determines the amount of requested THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes data to submit over performance years 1 through 4 and performance year subset 5.1 (with the exception of performance year subset 5.2, for which CMS will request the same amount of THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes as performance year subset 5.1, updated to reflect the timeframe applicable to performance year subset 5.2) of the model will be applied so that in year 1 successful submission of data would mean CMS received all requested THA/TKA patient-reported outcomes and limited risk variable data on both of the following:

        (A) Greater than or equal to 50 percent of eligible procedures or greater than or equal to 50 eligible patients during the data collection period.

#### § § 510.405

        (a)  The CJR model does not restrict Medicare beneficiaries' ability to choose any Medicare enrolled provider or supplier, or any physician or practitioner who has opted out of Medicare.

        (1) As part of discharge planning and referral, participant hospitals must provide a complete list of HHAs, SNFs, IRFs, or LTCHs that are participating in the Medicare program, and that serve the geographic area (as defined by the HHA) in which the patient resides, or in the case of a SNF, IRF, or LTCH, in the geographic area requested by the patient.

        (i) This list must be presented to CJR beneficiaries for whom home health care, SNF, IRF, or LTCH services are medically necessary.

        (ii) Participant hospitals must specify on the list those post-acute care providers on the list with whom they have a sharing arrangement.

        (iii) Participant hospitals may recommend preferred providers and suppliers, consistent with applicable statutes and regulations.

        (iv) Participant hospitals may not limit beneficiary choice to any list of providers or suppliers in any manner other than that permitted under applicable statutes and regulations.

        (v) Participant hospitals must take into account patient and family preferences when they are expressed.

        (2) Participant hospitals may not charge any CJR collaborator a fee to be included on any list of preferred providers or suppliers, nor may the participant hospital accept such payments.

        (b) —(1) —(i)  Each participant hospital must provide written notification to any Medicare beneficiary that meets the criteria in § 510.205 of his or her inclusion in the CJR model.

        (ii)  Prior to discharge from the anchor hospitalization, or prior to discharge from the anchor procedure, as applicable, the participant hospital must provide the CJR beneficiary with a participant hospital beneficiary notification as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.

        (iii)  The participant hospital must be able to generate a list of all beneficiaries receiving such notification, including the date on which the notification was provided to the beneficiary, to CMS or its designee upon request.

        (iv)  The beneficiary notification must contain all of the following:

        (A) A detailed explanation of the model and how it might be expected to affect the beneficiary's care.

        (B) Notification that the beneficiary retains freedom of choice to choose providers and services.

        (C) Explanation of how patients can access care records and claims data through an available patient portal, and how they can share access to their Blue Button® electronic health information with caregivers.

        (D) A statement that all existing Medicare beneficiary protections continue to be available to the beneficiary. These include the ability to report concerns of substandard care to Quality Improvement Organizations or the 1-800-MEDICARE helpline.

        (E) A list of the providers, suppliers, and ACOs with whom the CJR participant hospital has a sharing arrangement. This requirement may be fulfilled by the participant hospital including in the detailed notification a Web address where beneficiaries may access the list.

        (2)  A participant hospital must require every CJR collaborator to provide written notice to applicable CJR beneficiaries of the structure of the CJR model and the existence of its sharing arrangement with the participant hospital.

        (i) With the exception of ACOs, PGPs, NPPGPs, and TGPs, a CJR participant hospital must require every CJR collaborator that furnishes an item or service to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode to provide written notice to the beneficiary of the structure of the model and the existence of the individual's or entity's sharing arrangement. The notice must be provided no later than the time at which the beneficiary first receives an item or service from the CJR collaborator during a CJR episode. In circumstances where, due to the patient's condition, it is not feasible to provide notification at such time, the notification must be provided to the beneficiary or his or her representative as soon as is reasonably practicable. The CJR collaborator must be able to generate a list of all beneficiaries who received such a notice, including the date on which the notice was provided to the beneficiary, to CMS upon request.

        (ii) A participant hospital must require every PGP, NPPGP, or TGP that is a CJR collaborator where a member of the PGP, member of the NPPGP, or member of the TGP furnishes an item or service to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode to provide written notice to the beneficiary of the structure of the model and the existence of the entity's sharing arrangement. The notice must be provided no later than the time at which the beneficiary first receives an item or service from any member of the PGP, member of the NPPGP, or member of the TGP, and the required PGP, NPPGP, or TGP notice may be provided by that member respectively. In circumstances where, due to the patient's condition, it is not feasible to provide notice at such times, the notice must be provided to the beneficiary or his or her representative as soon as is reasonably practicable. The PGP, NPPGP, or TGP must be able to generate a list of all beneficiaries who received such a notice, including the date on which the notice was provided to the beneficiary, to CMS upon request.

        (iii) A participant hospital must require every ACO that is a CJR collaborator where an ACO participant or ACO provider/supplier furnishes an item or service to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode to provide written notice to the beneficiary of the structure of the model and the existence of the entity's sharing arrangement. The notice must be provided no later than the time at which the beneficiary first receives an item or service from any ACO participant or ACO provider/supplier and the required ACO notice may be provided by that ACO participant or ACO provider/supplier respectively. In circumstances where, due to the patient's condition, it is not feasible to provide notice at such times, the notice must be provided to the beneficiary or his or her representative as soon as is reasonably practicable. The ACO must be able to generate a list of all beneficiaries who received such a notice, including the date on which the notice was provided to the beneficiary, to CMS upon request.

        (3)  A participant hospital must provide the beneficiary with a written notice of any potential financial liability associated with non-covered services recommended or presented as an option as part of discharge planning, no later than the time that the beneficiary discusses a particular post-acute care option or at the time the beneficiary is discharged from an anchor procedure or anchor hospitalization, whichever occurs earlier.

        (i) If the participant hospital knows or should have known that the beneficiary is considering or has decided to receive a non-covered post-acute care service or other non-covered associated service or supply, the participant hospital must notify the beneficiary that the service would not be covered by Medicare.

        (ii) If the participant hospital is discharging a beneficiary to a SNF prior to the occurrence of a 3-day hospital stay, and the beneficiary is being transferred to or is considering a SNF that would not qualify under the SNF 3-day waiver in § 510.610, the participant hospital must notify the beneficiary in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section that the beneficiary will be responsible for payment for the services furnished by the SNF during that stay, except those services that would be covered by Medicare Part B during a non-covered inpatient SNF stay.

        (4)  Lists of beneficiaries that receive notifications or notices must be retained, and access provided to CMS, or its designees, in accordance with § 510.110.

#### § § 510.500

        (a)  (1) A participant hospital may enter into a sharing arrangement with a CJR collaborator to make a gainsharing payment, or to receive an alignment payment, or both. A participant hospital must not make a gainsharing payment or receive an alignment payment except in accordance with a sharing arrangement.

        (2) A sharing arrangement must comply with the provisions of this section and all other applicable laws and regulations, including the applicable fraud and abuse laws and all applicable payment and coverage requirements.

        (3) Participant hospitals must develop, maintain, and use a set of written policies for selecting individuals and entities to be CJR collaborators. These policies must contain criteria related to, and inclusive of, the quality of care delivered by the potential CJR collaborator.

A selection criterion that considers whether a potential CJR collaborator has performed a reasonable minimum number of services that would qualify as CJR activities will be deemed not to violate the volume or value standard if the purpose of the criterion is to ensure the quality of care furnished to CJR beneficiaries.

        (4) If a participant hospital enters into a sharing arrangement, its compliance program must include oversight of sharing arrangements and compliance with the applicable requirements of the CJR model.

        (b)  (1) A sharing arrangement must be in writing and signed by the parties, and entered into before care is furnished to CJR beneficiaries under the sharing arrangement.

        (2) Participation in a sharing arrangement must be voluntary and without penalty for nonparticipation.

        (3) The sharing arrangement must require the CJR collaborator and its employees, contractors (including collaboration agents), and subcontractors (including downstream collaboration agents) to comply with all of the following:

        (i) The applicable provisions of this part (including requirements regarding beneficiary notifications, access to records, record retention, and participation in any evaluation, monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities performed by CMS or its designees).

        (ii) All applicable Medicare provider enrollment requirements at § 424.500 of this chapter, including having a valid and active TIN or NPI, during the term of the sharing arrangement.

        (iii) All other applicable laws and regulations.

        (4) The sharing arrangement must require the CJR collaborator to have or be covered by a compliance program that includes oversight of the sharing arrangement and compliance with the requirements of the CJR model that apply to its role as a CJR collaborator, including any distribution arrangements.

        (5) The sharing arrangement must not pose a risk to beneficiary access, beneficiary freedom of choice, or quality of care.

        (6) The board or other governing body of the participant hospital must have responsibility for overseeing the participant hospital's participation in the CJR model, its arrangements with CJR collaborators, its payment of gainsharing payments, its receipt of alignment payments, and its use of beneficiary incentives in the CJR model.

        (7) The written agreement memorializing a sharing arrangement must specify the following:

        (i) The purpose and scope of the sharing arrangement.

        (ii) The obligations of the parties, including specified CJR activities and other services to be performed by the parties under the sharing arrangement.

        (i) Induce the participant hospital, CJR collaborator, or any employees, contractors, or subcontractors of the participant hospital or CJR collaborator to reduce or limit medically necessary services to any Medicare beneficiary; or

        (ii) Restrict the ability of a CJR collaborator to make decisions in the best interests of its patients, including the selection of devices, supplies, and treatments.

        (c)  (1) Gainsharing payments, if any, must—

        (i) Be derived solely from reconciliation payments, or internal cost savings, or both;

        (ii) Be distributed on an annual basis (not more than once per calendar year);

        (iii) Not be a loan, advance payment, or payment for referrals or other business; and

        (iv) Be clearly identified as a gainsharing payment at the time it is paid.

        (2)(i) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, a CJR collaborator must meet quality of care criteria for the performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment. The quality of care criteria must be established by the participant hospital and directly related to the CJR episode.

        (iii) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, or to be required to make an alignment payment, a CJR collaborator that is a PGP, NPPGP, or TGP must meet the following criteria:

        (A) The PGP, NPPGP, or TGP must have billed for an item or service that was rendered by one or more PGP member, NPPGP member, or TGP member respectively to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount.

        (B) The PGP, NPPGP, or TGP must have contributed to CJR activities and been clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries during the same performance year for which the CJR participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount. For example, a PGP, NPPGP, or TGP might have been clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries by—

        () Providing care coordination services to beneficiaries during and/or after inpatient admission;

        () Engaging with a participant hospital in care redesign strategies, and actually performing a role in implementing such strategies, that are designed to improve the quality of care for CJR episodes and reduce CJR episode spending; or

        () In coordination with other providers and suppliers (such as PGP members, NPPGP members, or TGP members; the participant hospital; and post-acute care providers), implementing strategies designed to address and manage the comorbidities of CJR beneficiaries.

        (iv) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, or to be required to make an alignment payment, a CJR collaborator that is an ACO must meet the following criteria:

        (A) The ACO must have had an ACO provider/supplier that directly furnished, or an ACO participant that billed for, an item or service that was rendered to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount; and

        (B) The ACO must have contributed to CJR activities and been clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed the repayment amount. For example, an ACO might be have been clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries by—

        () Providing care coordination services to CJR beneficiaries during and/or after inpatient admission;

        () Engaging with a participant hospital in care redesign strategies, and actually performing a role in implementing such strategies, that are designed to improve the quality of care and reduce spending for CJR episodes; or

        () In coordination with providers and suppliers (such as ACO participants, ACO providers/suppliers, the participant hospital, and post-acute care providers), implementing strategies designed to address and manage the comorbidities of CJR beneficiaries.

        (3)(i) The methodology for accruing, calculating and verifying internal cost savings must be transparent, measurable, and verifiable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book).

        (ii) The methodology used to calculate internal cost savings must reflect the actual, internal cost savings achieved by the participant hospital through the documented implementation of CJR activities identified by the participant hospital and must exclude—

        (A) Any savings realized by any individual or entity that is not the participant hospital; and

        (B) “Paper” savings from accounting conventions or past investment in fixed costs.

        (4) The total amount of a gainsharing payment for a performance year paid to a CJR collaborator must not exceed the following:

        (i) For episodes beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and ending on or before September 30, 2021, in the case of a CJR collaborator who is a physician or non-physician practitioner, 50 percent of the Medicare-approved amounts under the PFS for items and services furnished by that physician or non-physician practitioner to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries during CJR model episodes that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment being made.

        (ii) For episodes beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and ending on or before September 30, 2021, in the case of a CJR collaborator that is a PGP or NPPGP, 50 percent of the Medicare-approved amounts under the PFS for items and services billed by that PGP or NPPGP and furnished to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries by the PGP members or NPPGP members respectively during CJR model episodes that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment being made.

        (5) The amount of any gainsharing payments must be determined in accordance with a methodology that is substantially based on quality of care and the provision of CJR activities. The methodology may take into account the amount of such CJR activities provided by a CJR collaborator relative to other CJR collaborators.

        Pricing Methodology

          § 512.250   Determination of national base rates.

#### § § 512.250

          CMS determines a national base rate for the PC and TC for each included cancer type.

          (a) National base rates are the historical average cost for an episode of care for each of the included cancer types prior to the Model performance period.

          (b) National base rates are determined in the following manner:

          (1) CMS excludes from episode pricing and RO episode pricing any claim containing an RT service furnished:

          (i) In Maryland, Vermont, or any of the U.S. Territories;

          (ii) In the inpatient setting;

          (iii) By an entity classified as an ASC, CAH, or PPS-exempt cancer hospital; or

          (iv) By an HOPD participating in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model at the time the RT service was furnished.

          (2) CMS excludes the following episodes from the determination of the national base rates:

          (i) Episodes that are not linked to a CBSA selected for participation in the RO Model;

          (ii) Episodes that are not attributed to an RT provider or RT supplier;

          (iii) Episodes that are not assigned an included cancer type; or

          (iv) Episodes for which the total allowed amount for RT services listed on claims used to calculate an episode's payment amount is not greater than $0.

          (3) CMS calculates the episode amount CMS paid on average to RT providers and RT suppliers for the PC and TC for each of the included cancer types in the HOPD setting, creating the RO Model's national base rates.

          § 512.255   Determination of participant-specific professional episode payment and participant-specific technical episode payment amounts.

#### § § 512.255

          (a) Thirty days before the start of each PY, CMS provides each RO participant its case mix and historical experience adjustments for both the PC and TC as calculated in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section. If an RO participant is not eligible to receive a historical experience adjustment or case mix adjustment as described under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, then CMS provides a zero value for those adjustments.

          (b) Any episode used to calculate the participant-specific professional episode payment amounts and the participant-specific technical episode payment amounts for an RO participant is subject to the exclusions described in § 512.250(b)(1) and (2).

          (c) CMS calculates the participant-specific professional episode payment amounts and participant-specific technical episode payment amounts for each included cancer type using the following:

          (1)  For every PY, CMS adjusts the national base rates for the PC and TC of each cancer type by calculating a separate trend factor for the PC and TC of each included cancer type.

          (2)  CMS adjusts the trended national base rates prior to applying each RO participant's case mix and historical experience, and prior to applying the discounts and withholds, for local cost and wage indices based on where RT services are furnished, as described by existing geographic adjustment processes in the OPPS and PFS.

          (3)  CMS establishes and applies a case mix adjustment to the national base rate after the trend factor and geographic adjustment have applied. The case mix adjustment reflects episode or RO episode characteristics that may be beyond the control of RO participants such as cancer type, age, sex, presence of a major procedure, death during the episode, and presence of chemotherapy.

          (4)  CMS establishes and applies a historical experience adjustment to the national base rate after the trend factor, geographic adjustment, and case mix adjustment have been applied. The historical experience adjustments reflect each RO participant's actual historical experience.

          (5)  CMS blends each RO participant's historical experience adjustment and the geographically-adjusted trended national base rate. The blend for RO participants with a professional historical experience adjustment or technical historical experience adjustment with a value equal to or less than zero is 90/10, meaning the calculation of the participant-specific episode payment amount is weighted according to 90 percent of the RO participant's historical experience adjustment and 10 percent of the geographically-adjusted trended national base for PY1 through PY5. The blend for RO participants with a professional historical experience adjustment or technical historical experience adjustment of more than zero is 90/10 in PY1, 85/15 in PY2, 80/20 in PY3, 75/25 in PY4, and 70/30 in PY5.

          (6)  (i) RO participants must notify CMS in writing of a merger, acquisition, or other new clinical or business relationship, at least 90 days before the date of the change as described in § 424.516.

          (ii) CMS updates case mix and historical experience adjustments according to the relevant treatment history that applies as a result of a merger, acquisition, or other new clinical or business relationship in the RO participant's case mix and historical experience adjustment calculations from the effective date of the change.

          (7)  (i) RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes in the baseline period do not receive a historical experience adjustment during the model performance period.

          (ii) RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes in the baseline period do not receive a case mix adjustment for PY1.

          (iii) RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes in the baseline period that continue to have fewer than 60 episodes in the rolling 3-year period used to determine the case mix adjustment for each PY and that have never received a case mix adjustment do not receive a case mix adjustment for that PY.

          (iv) RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes in the baseline period and were furnishing included RT services in the CBSAs selected for participation before the start of the model performance period are eligible to receive a stop-loss reconciliation amount, if applicable, as described in § 512.285(f).

          (8)  CMS reduces each episode payment by the discount factor after applying the trend factor, geographic adjustment, and case mix and historical experience adjustments to the national base rate.

          (9)  To account for duplicate RT services and incomplete episodes:

          (i) CMS withholds from each RO participant 1 percent from each episode payment, after applying the trend factor, geographic adjustment, case mix and historical experience adjustments, and discount to the national base rate.

          (ii) CMS determines during the annual reconciliation process set forth at § 512.285 whether an RO participant is eligible to receive a portion or all of the withheld amount or whether any payment is owed to CMS.

          (10)  In accordance with § 414.1415(b)(1) of this chapter, CMS withholds 2 percent from each professional episode payment after applying the trend factor, geographic adjustment, case mix and historical experience adjustments, and discount factor to the national base rate. RO participants may earn back this withhold, in part or in full, based on their AQS.

          (11)  Starting in PY3,

          (i) CMS withholds 1 percent from each technical episode payment after applying the trend factor, geographic adjustment, case mix and historical experience adjustments, and discount factor to the national base rate.

          (ii) RO participants may earn back their patient-experience withhold, in part or in full, based on their results from the CAHPS® Cancer Care Radiation Therapy survey.

          (12)  RO participants may collect beneficiary coinsurance payments for services furnished under the RO Model in multiple installments under a payment plan.

          (i) The availability of payment plans may not be used as a marketing tool to influence beneficiary choice of health care provider.

          (ii) RO participants offering a payment plan may inform the RO beneficiary of the availability of the payment plan prior to or during the initial treatment planning session and as necessary thereafter.

          (iii) The beneficiary coinsurance payment equals 20 percent of the episode payment amount to be paid to the RO participant(s) prior to the application of sequestration for the billed RO Model-specific HCPCS code with a SOE modifier and for the billed RO Model-specific HCPCS code with an EOE modifier for the PC and TC, except as provided in paragraph (c)(12)(iv) and(v) of this section.

          (iv) In the case of incomplete episodes, the beneficiary coinsurance payment equals 20 percent of the FFS amounts that would have been paid in the absence of the RO Model for the services furnished by the RO participant that initiated the PC and the RO participant that initiated the TC (if applicable).

          (v) In the case of duplicate RT services, the beneficiary coinsurance payment equals 20 percent of the episode payment amount to be paid to the RO participant(s) per § 512.255(c)(12)(iii) and 20 percent of the FFS amount to the RT provider and/or RT supplier furnishing one or more duplicate RT services.

          (13)  In accordance with applicable law, CMS deducts a percentage from each episode payment after applying the trend factor, geographic adjustment, case mix and historical experience adjustments, discount, withholds, and coinsurance to the national base rate.

          (14)  (i) CMS calculates the RO participant's case mix adjustments in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section based on all episodes and RO episodes, as applicable, attributed to the RO participant's legacy TIN(s) or legacy CCN(s), and current TIN or CCN, during the 3-year period that determines the case mix adjustment for each PY.

          (ii) CMS calculates the RO participant's historical experience adjustments in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section based on all episodes attributed to the RO participant's legacy TIN(s) or legacy CCN(s), and current TIN or CCN, during the baseline period.

          (3) RO participants must bill the same RO Model-specific HCPCS code that initiated the RO episode and an EOE modifier to indicate that the RO episode has ended.

          (4) RO participants may submit a claim with an EOE modifier only after the RT course of treatment has ended, except that such claim must not be submitted earlier than 28 days after the date of the initial treatment planning service.

          (c)  RO participants must bill for any medically necessary RT services furnished to an RO beneficiary during a clean period in accordance with existing FFS billing processes in the OPPS and PFS.

          (d)  RO participants must submit no-pay claims for any medically necessary included RT services furnished to an RO beneficiary during an RO episode pursuant to existing FFS billing processes in the OPPS and PFS.

          § 512.265   Payment.

#### § § 512.265

          (a)  CMS pays an RO participant for all included RT services furnished to an RO beneficiary during a completed RO episode as follows:

          (1) CMS pays a Professional participant a participant-specific professional episode payment for the professional component furnished to an RO beneficiary during an RO episode.

          (2) CMS pays a Technical participant a participant-specific technical episode payment for the technical component furnished to an RO beneficiary during an RO episode.

          (3) CMS pays a Dual participant a participant-specific professional episode payment and a participant-specific technical episode payment for the professional component and technical component furnished to an RO beneficiary during an RO episode.

        Reconciliation and Review Process

          § 512.285   Reconciliation process.

#### § § 512.285

          (a)  CMS conducts an initial reconciliation and a true-up reconciliation for each RO participant for each PY in accordance with this section.

          (b)  (1) To determine the reconciliation payment or the repayment amount based on RO episodes initiated in a PY, CMS performs the following steps:

          (i) CMS calculates an RO participant's incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (ii) CMS calculates the RO participant's quality reconciliation amount as described in paragraph (d) of this section, if applicable.

          (iii) CMS calculates the RO participant's patient experience reconciliation amount, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, if applicable.

          (iv) CMS calculates the stop-loss reconciliation amount, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, if applicable.

          (v) CMS adds, as applicable, the incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount, any quality reconciliation payment amount, any patient experience reconciliation amount, and any stop-loss reconciliation payment amount. The sum of these amounts results in a reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

          (2) CMS calculations use claims data available at the time of reconciliation.

          (c)  CMS calculates the incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount as follows:

          (1)  CMS calculates the total incorrect payment withhold amount by adding the incorrect payment withhold amount for each episode initiated in the PY.

          (2)  CMS calculates the total duplicate RT services amount by adding all FFS amounts for duplicate RT services furnished during each episode initiated in the PY. The duplicate RT services amount is capped for each episode and will not be more than the participant-specific professional episode payment amount or participant-specific technical episode payment amount received by the RO participant for an RO episode, even if the duplicate RT services amount exceeds the participant-specific professional episode payment amount or the participant-specific technical episode payment amount.

          (3)  For incomplete episodes initiated in the PY, CMS determines the total incomplete episode amount by calculating the difference between the following amounts:

          (i) The sum of all FFS amounts that would have been paid to the RO participant in the absence of the RO Model for any included RT services furnished during such incomplete episodes, as determined by no-pay claims. CMS owes this sum to the RO participant for such incomplete episodes.

          (ii) The sum of the participant-specific episode payment amounts paid to the RO participant for such incomplete episodes initiated in the PY.

          (4)  CMS calculates the total incorrect episode payment amount as follows:

          (i) If the sum described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section is more than the sum described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the difference is subtracted from the total duplicate RT services amount described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the resulting amount is the total incorrect episode payment amount.

          (ii) If the sum described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section is less than the sum described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the difference is added to the total duplicate RT services amount described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the resulting amount is the total incorrect episode payment amount.

          (5)  If the total incorrect episode payment amount represents money owed by the RO participant to CMS, CMS subtracts the total incorrect episode payment amount from the total incorrect payment withhold amount. In the case that the total incorrect episode payment amount represents money owed by CMS to the RO participant, CMS adds the total incorrect episode payment amount to the total incorrect payment withhold amount. The resulting amount is the RO participant's incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount.

          (d)  For Professional participants and Dual participants, CMS determines the quality reconciliation payment amount for each PY by multiplying the participant's AQS (as a percentage) by the total quality withhold amount for all RO episodes initiated during the PY.

          (e)  For PY3 and subsequent PYs, CMS determines the patient experience reconciliation amount for RO participants by multiplying the participant's AQS (as a percentage) by the total patient experience withhold amount for all RO episodes initiated during the PY.

          (f)  CMS determines the stop-loss reconciliation amount for RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes during the baseline period and were furnishing included RT services before the start of the model performance period in the CBSAs selected for participation by—

          (1) Using no-pay claims, CMS calculates the total FFS amount by summing the FFS amounts that would have been paid to the RO participant in the absence of the RO Model for all included RT services furnished during the RO episodes initiated in the PY; and

          (2) CMS calculates the sum of all participant-specific professional episode payments and participant-specific technical episode payments paid to the RO participant for the RO episodes initiated in the PY.

          (3) If the total FFS amount exceeds the sum of the participant-specific episode payment amounts for the PY by more than 20 percent then CMS owes the RO participant the amount that exceeds 20 percent, either increasing the amount of the RO participant's reconciliation payment or reducing the amount of the RO's participant's reconciliation repayment.

          (g)  CMS conducts a true-up reconciliation in the same manner described in paragraph (b) of this section (except that the quality reconciliation payment amount and the patient experience reconciliation amount are not calculated) to determine any additional reconciliation payment or repayment amount that are identified using 12-months of claims run-out.

          (h)  CMS issues each RO participant a reconciliation report for each PY. Each reconciliation report contains the following:

          (1) The RO participant's reconciliation payment or repayment amount, if any, for the relevant PY.

          (2) Any additional reconciliation payment or repayment amount owed for a previous PY as a result of the true-up reconciliation.

          (3) The net reconciliation payment or repayment amount owed.

          (i)  (1) CMS issues a reconciliation payment to the RO participant in the amount specified in the reconciliation report 30 days after the reconciliation report is deemed final.

          (2) The RO participant must pay a repayment amount to CMS in the amount specified in the reconciliation report by a deadline specified by CMS. If the RO participant fails to timely pay the full repayment amount, CMS recoups the repayment amount from any payments otherwise owed by CMS to the RO participant, including Medicare payments for items and services unrelated to the RO Model.

          (3) No coinsurance is owed by an RO beneficiary with respect to any repayment amount or reconciliation payment.

          § 512.290   Timely error notice and reconsideration review process.

#### § § 512.290

          (a)  Subject to the limitations on review in § 512.170, an RO participant that identifies and wishes to contest a suspected error in the calculation of its reconciliation payment or repayment amount or AQS must provide written notice of the suspected calculation error to CMS within 45 days of the date of the reconciliation report. Such timely error notice must be in a form and manner specified by CMS. RO participants are not permitted to contest the RO Model pricing methodology or AQS methodology.

          (1) Unless a timely error notice is received by CMS within 45 days of the date of issuance of a reconciliation report, the reconciliation payment or repayment amount determination specified in that reconciliation report is deemed binding and not subject to further review.

          (2) If CMS receives a timely error notice, then CMS responds in writing within 30 days either to confirm that there was an error in the calculation or to verify that the calculation is correct. CMS may extend the deadline for its response upon written notice to the RO participant.

          (3) Only the RO participant may use the timely error notice process described in this paragraph and the reconsideration review process described in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (b) —(1)  (i) If the RO participant is dissatisfied with CMS' response to the timely error notice, then the RO participant may request a reconsideration review as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

#### § § 512.294

          (a)  If CMS determines that there is an EUC pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, CMS may grant RO participants exceptions to the RO Model requirements under paragraph (c) of this section and revise the RO Model's pricing methodology under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

          (b)  CMS determines whether there is an EUC based on the following factors:

          (1) Whether the RO participants are furnishing services within a geographic area considered to be within an “emergency area” during an “emergency period” as defined in section 1135(g) of the Social Security Act;

          (2) Whether the geographic area within a county, parish, U.S. territory, or tribal government designated under the Stafford Act served as a condition precedent for the Secretary's exercise of the 1135 waiver authority, or the National Emergencies Act; or

          (3) Whether a state of emergency has been declared in the geographic area.

          (c)  CMS may grant RO Participants exceptions to the following RO Model requirements:

          (1)  CMS may delay or exempt RO participants from one or more of the RO Model's quality measure or clinical data element reporting requirements if an EUC impacts the RO participants' ability to comply with quality measure or clinical data element reporting requirements.

          (2)  CMS may issue a notice on the RO Model website that may waive compliance with or modify the following RO Model requirements:

          (i) The requirement set forth at § 512.220(a)(2)(vii) that RO participants provide Peer Review (audit and feedback on treatment plans).

          (ii) The requirement set forth at § 512.220(a)(3) that RO participants actively engage with an AHRQ-listed patient safety organization (PSO).

          (d)  If CMS determines that the EUC affects the United States and if CMS determines that the EUC would impact RO participants' ability to implement the requirements of the RO Model prior to the start of the model performance period, CMS may amend the model performance period.

          (e)  If CMS determines that the EUC affects the entire United States, and if CMS determines that as a result of the EUC, the trend factor (specific to the PC, TC, or both for an included cancer type) for the upcoming PY has increased or decreased by more than 10 percent compared to the corresponding trend factor of the previous CY when FFS payment rates are held constant with the previous CY, CMS may modify the trend factor calculation for the PC, TC, or both the PC and TC of an included cancer type in a manner that ensures the trend factor is consistent with the average utilization from the previous CY.

          (f)  In response to a national, regional, or local event, CMS may adjust the quality withhold by choosing to repay the quality withhold during the next reconciliation and award all possible points in the subsequent AQS calculation amount or to not apply the quality withhold to RO Model payments during the EUC if CMS removes the quality measure and clinical data element reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

#### § § 512.360

          (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, CMS attributes ESRD Beneficiaries to an ETC Participant for each month during a MY based on the ESRD Beneficiary's receipt of services specified in paragraph (c) of this section during that month, for the purpose of assessing the ETC Participant's performance on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate during that MY. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, CMS attributes Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to a Managing Clinician for one or more months during a MY based on the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary's receipt of services specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section during that MY, for the purpose of assessing the Managing Clinician's performance on the living donor transplant rate during that MY. CMS attributes ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to the ETC Participant for each month during a MY retrospectively after the end of the MY. CMS attributes an ESRD Beneficiary to no more than one ESRD facility and no more than one Managing Clinician for a given month during a given MY. CMS attributes a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary to no more than one Managing Clinician for a given MY.

          (b)  CMS does not attribute an ESRD Beneficiary or Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary to an ETC Participant for a month if, at any point during the month, the beneficiary—

          (1) Is not enrolled in Medicare Part B;

          (2) Is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a cost plan, or other Medicare managed care plan;

          (3) Does not reside in the United States;

          (7) Has a diagnosis of dementia at any point during the month of the claim service date or the preceding 12 months, as identified using the most recent dementia-related criteria at the time of beneficiary attribution, using the CMS-HCC (Hierarchical Condition Category) Risk Adjustment Model ICD-10-CM Mappings; or

          (8) Is residing in or receiving dialysis in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or nursing facility.

          (c) —(1)  To be attributed to an ESRD facility that is an ETC Participant for a month, an ESRD Beneficiary must not be excluded based on the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section and must have received renal dialysis services during the month from the ESRD facility. CMS does not attribute Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to ESRD facilities.

          (i) An ESRD Beneficiary is attributed to the ESRD facility at which the ESRD Beneficiary received the plurality of his or her dialysis treatments in that month, other than renal dialysis services for AKI, as identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X, with claim service dates at the claim header through date during the month.

          (ii) If the ESRD Beneficiary receives an equal number of dialysis treatments from two or more ESRD facilities in a given month, CMS attributes the ESRD Beneficiary to the ESRD facility at which the beneficiary received the earliest dialysis treatment that month. If the ESRD Beneficiary receives an equal number of dialysis treatments from two or more ESRD facilities in a given month and the ESRD beneficiary received the earliest dialysis treatment that month from more than one ESRD facility, CMS attributes the beneficiary to one of the ESRD facilities that furnished the earliest dialysis treatment that month at random.

          (2)  (i) An ESRD beneficiary who is not excluded based on the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section is attributed to a Managing Clinician who is an ETC Participant for a month if that Managing Clinician submitted an MCP claim for services furnished to the beneficiary, identified with CPT codes 90957, 90958, 90959, 90960, 90961, 90962, 90965, or 90966, with claim service dates at the claim line through date during the month.

          (A) If more than one Managing Clinician submits a claim for the MCP furnished to a single ESRD Beneficiary with a claim service date at the claim line during the month, the ESRD Beneficiary is attributed to the Managing Clinician associated with the earliest claim service date at the claim line through date during the month.

          (B) If more than one Managing Clinician submits a claim for the MCP furnished to a single ESRD Beneficiary with the same earliest claim service date at the claim line through date for the month, the ESRD Beneficiary is randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians.

          (ii) For MY1 and MY2, a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary who is not excluded based on the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section is attributed to the Managing Clinician with whom the beneficiary has had the most claims between the start of the MY and the month in which the beneficiary received the transplant for all months between the start of the MY and the month of the transplant.

          (A) If no Managing Clinician has had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary during the MY, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is attributed to the Managing Clinician associated with the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the MY up to and including the month of the transplant.

          (B) If no Managing Clinician had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of services for that beneficiary during the MY, and more than one of those Managing Clinicians had the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the MY up to and including the month of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians.

          (iii) For MY3 through MY10, a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary who is not excluded based on the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section is attributed to the Managing Clinician who submitted the most claims for services furnished to the beneficiary in the 365 days preceding the date in which the beneficiary received the transplant.

          (A) If no Managing Clinician has had the most claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary in the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is attributed to the Managing Clinician associated with the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant.

          (B) If no Managing Clinician had the most claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary in the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant, and more than one of those Managing Clinicians had the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians.

          (C) The Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is considered eligible for attribution under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) if the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary has at least 1-eligible month during the 12-month period that includes the month of the transplant and the 11 months prior to the month of the transplant. An eligible month refers to a month during which the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary not does not meet exclusion criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.

          § 512.365   Performance assessment.

#### § § 512.365

          (a)  For each MY, CMS separately assesses the home dialysis rate and the transplant rate for each ETC Participant based on the population of ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries attributed to the ETC Participant under § 512.360. Information used to calculate the home dialysis rate and the transplant rate includes Medicare claims data, Medicare administrative data, and data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.

          (b)  CMS calculates the home dialysis rate for ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians as follows.

          (1)  (i) The denominator is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. Dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the denominator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility, such that one beneficiary year is composed of 12 beneficiary months. Months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X.

          (ii) For MY1 and MY2, the numerator is the total number of home dialysis treatment beneficiary years plus one half the total number of self dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. For MY3 through MY10, the numerator is the total number of home dialysis treatment beneficiary years, plus one half the total number of self dialysis treatment beneficiary years, plus one half the total number of nocturnal in center dialysis beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY.

          (A) Home dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis at home, such that 1-beneficiary year is comprised of 12-beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and condition codes 74 or 76.

          (B) Self dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received self dialysis in center, such that 1-beneficiary year is comprised of 12-beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received self dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and condition code 72.

          (C) Nocturnal in center dialysis beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received nocturnal in center dialysis, such that 1-beneficiary year is comprised of 12-beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received nocturnal in center dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and modifier UJ.

          (iii) Information used to calculate the ESRD facility home dialysis rate includes Medicare claims data and Medicare administrative data.

          (iv) The ESRD facility home dialysis rate is aggregated, as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

          § 512.370   Benchmarking and scoring.

#### § § 512.370

          (a)  (1) CMS assesses the home dialysis rate and transplant rate for each ETC Participant against the applicable benchmarks to calculate an—

          (i) Achievement score, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; and

          (ii) Improvement score, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (2)(i) CMS calculates the ETC Participant's MPS as the weighted sum of the higher of the achievement score or the improvement score for the ETC Participant's home dialysis rate and transplant rate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

          (ii) The ETC Participant's MPS determines the ETC Participant's PPA, as described in § 512.380.

          (b)  CMS assesses ETC Participant performance at the aggregation group level on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate against achievement benchmarks constructed based on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate among aggregation groups of ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians located in Comparison Geographic Areas during the Benchmark Year. Achievement benchmarks are calculated as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and, for MY3 through MY10, are stratified as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For MY5 through MY10, the ETC Participant's achievement score is subject to the restriction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (1)  CMS uses the following scoring methodology to assess an ETC Participant's achievement score.

          (2)  For MY3 through MY10, CMS stratifies achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of beneficiary years attributed to the aggregation group for which attributed beneficiaries are dual eligible or LIS recipients during the MY. An ESRD Beneficiary or Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is considered to be dual eligible or a LIS recipient for a given month if at any point during the month the beneficiary was dual eligible or an LIS recipient based on Medicare administrative data. CMS stratifies the achievement benchmarks into the following two strata:

          (i)  50 percent or more of attributed beneficiary years during the MY are for beneficiaries who are dual eligible or LIS recipients.

          (ii)  Less than 50 percent of attributed beneficiary years during the MY are for beneficiaries who are dual eligible or LIS recipients.

          (3) For MY5 through MY10, CMS will assign an achievement score to an ETC Participant for the home dialysis rate or the transplant rate only if the ETC Participant's aggregation group has a home dialysis rate or a transplant rate greater than zero for the MY.

          (c)  CMS assesses ETC Participant improvement on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate against benchmarks constructed based on the ETC Participant's aggregation group's historical performance on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate during the Benchmark Year to calculate the ETC Participant's improvement score, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For MY3 through MY10, CMS assesses ETC Participant improvement on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate for ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries, who are dual eligible or LIS recipients to determine whether to add the Health Equity Incentive to the ETC Participant's improvement score, as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

          (1)  CMS uses the following scoring methodology to assess an ETC Participant's improvement score.

          (i) Greater than 10 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 1.5 points

          (ii) Greater than 5 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 1 point

          (iii) Greater than 0 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 0.5 points

          (iv) Less than or equal to the Benchmark Year rate: 0 points

          (v) For MY3 through MY10, when calculating improvement benchmarks constructed based on the ETC Participant's aggregation group's historical performance on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate during the Benchmark Year, CMS adds one beneficiary month to the numerator of the home dialysis rate and adds one beneficiary month to the numerator of the transplant rate, such that the Benchmark Year rates cannot be equal to zero.

          (2)  CMS calculates the ETC Participant's aggregation group's home dialysis rate and transplant rate as specified in §§ 512.365(b) and 512.365(c), respectively, using only attributed beneficiary years comprised of months during the MY in which ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries, are dual eligible or LIS recipients. CMS also calculates the threshold for earning the Health Equity Incentive based on the ETC Participant's aggregation group's historical performance on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate during the Benchmark Year, using only attributed beneficiary years comprised of months during the Benchmark Year in which ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries, are dual eligible or LIS recipients. An ESRD Beneficiary or Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is considered to be dual eligible or a LIS recipient for a given month if at any point during the month the beneficiary was dual eligible or a LIS recipient. CMS determines whether a beneficiary was dual eligible or a LIS recipient based on Medicare administrative data.

          (i) The ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the home dialysis rate improvement score if the home dialysis rate for the MY, calculated as specified in this paragraph (c)(2), is at least 2.5-percentage points higher than the home dialysis rate for the Benchmark Year, calculated as specified in this paragraph (c)(2). If the ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the home dialysis rate improvement score, CMS adds 0.5 points to the ETC Participant's home dialysis rate improvement score, calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the ETC Participant is ineligible to receive the Home Equity Incentive as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

          (ii) The ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the transplant rate improvement score if the home dialysis rate for the MY, calculated as specified in this paragraph (c)(2), is at least 2.5-percentage points higher than the transplant rate for the Benchmark Year, calculated as specified in this paragraph (c)(2). If the ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the transplant rate improvement score, CMS adds 0.5 points to the ETC Participant's transplant rate improvement score, calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the ETC Participant is ineligible to receive the Home Equity Incentive as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

          (iii) An ETC Participant in an aggregation group with fewer than 11-attributed beneficiary years comprised of months in which ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries, are dual eligible or LIS recipients, during either the Benchmark Year or the MY is ineligible to earn the Health Equity Incentive.

          (d)  (1) For MY1 and MY2, CMS calculates the ETC Participant's MPS as the higher of ETC Participant's achievement score or improvement score for the home dialysis rate, together with the higher of the ETC Participant's achievement score or improvement score for the transplant rate, weighted such that the ETC Participant's score for the home dialysis rate constitutes   of the MPS and the ETC Participant's score for the transplant rate constitutes   of the MPS. CMS uses the following formula to calculate the ETC Participant's MPS for MY1 and MY2:

          (2) For MY3 through MY10, CMS calculates the ETC Participant's MPS as the higher of the ETC Participant's achievement score for the home dialysis rate or the sum of the ETC Participant's improvement score for the home dialysis rate calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, if applicable, the Health Equity Incentive, calculated as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, together with the higher of the ETC Participant's achievement score for the transplant rate or the sum of the ETC Participant's improvement score for the transplant rate calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, if applicable, the Heath Equity Incentive, calculated as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, weighted such that the ETC Participant's score for the home dialysis rate constitutes   of the MPS and the ETC Participant's score for the transplant rate constitutes   of the MPS. CMS uses the following formula to calculate the ETC Participant's MPS for MY3 through MY10:

      Subpart D—Increasing Organ Transplant Access (IOTA) Model

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 96445, Dec. 4, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

        Increasing Organ Transplant Access Model Scope and Participation

          § 512.412   Participant eligibility and selection.

#### § § 512.412

          (a)  A kidney transplant hospital is eligible to be selected as an IOTA participant, in accordance with the methodology described in paragraph (c) of this section, if the kidney transplant hospital meets both of the following criteria:

          (1) The kidney transplant hospital annually performed 11 or more kidney transplants for patients aged 18 years or older, regardless of payer, each of the baseline years.

          (2) The kidney transplant hospital annually performed more than 50 percent of its kidney transplants on patients 18 years of age or older each of the baseline years.

          (b)  CMS uses the following process to select IOTA participants for inclusion in the model.

          (1)  CMS uses the following criteria to stratify DSAs using the list of DSAs as of January 1, 2024:

          (i) Census division of the DSA.

          (ii) Total number of adult kidney transplants performed per year across eligible kidney transplant hospitals in the DSA during PY 1's baseline years.

          (2)  Prior to sampling DSAs, CMS uses the following steps to group DSAs into mutually exclusive groups.

          (i) CMS assigns each DSA to one of the nine Census Divisions. CMS assigns each DSA to the Census Division where the majority of the DSA's population resides. CMS determines each DSA's population, and the share of a DSA's population in the applicable Census Division(s) using data from the 2020 Census.

          (A) CMS assigns the Puerto Rico DSA to the South Atlantic Census Divisions.

          (B) CMS combines the Middle Atlantic and New England Census Divisions and all DSAs therewithin creating eight groups of Census Divisions.

          (ii) CMS identifies all kidney transplant hospitals located in each DSA within each Census Division group.

          (iii) For each DSA within its assigned Census Division group, CMS identifies the eligible kidney transplant hospitals using the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (iv) Using data from each of the baseline years for PY 1, CMS determines the average number of adult kidney transplants performed annually by eligible transplant hospitals located in each DSA as follows:

          (A) Sums the number of adult kidney transplants performed across eligible kidney transplant hospitals in a DSA during each of the baseline years for PY 1; and

          (B) Divides each DSA's sum resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section by three to determine the average number of adult kidney transplants furnished during the baseline years for PY 1.

          (v) CMS separates DSAs in each Census Division group into two mutually exclusive groups of the same size, based on the average number of adult kidney transplants performed annually across the baseline years for PY 1, except where there are an odd number of DSAs within a Census Division group:

          (A) DSAs with a higher number of adult kidney transplants per year across the baseline years for PY 1.

          (B) DSAs with a lower number of adult kidney transplants per year across the baseline years for PY 1.

          (vi) Where there are an odd number of DSAs within a Census Division group CMS uses the methodology set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (3)  (i) For each DSA group within a Census Division group containing an odd number of DSAs, CMS randomly selects one DSA and determines its participation in the IOTA Model with a 50 percent probability.

          (ii) CMS randomly samples, without replacement, 50 percent of the remaining DSAs in each group within each Census Division group created in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

          (c)  All eligible kidney transplant hospitals in the selected DSAs are required to participate in the IOTA Model.

          (d)  CMS notifies IOTA participants of their selection to participate in the IOTA Model in a form and manner chosen by CMS at least 3 months prior to the start of the model performance period.

          § 512.414   Patient population.

#### § § 512.414

          (a)  (1) CMS attributes kidney transplant waitlist patients and kidney transplant patients to IOTA participants based on the attribution criteria as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, for all of the following purposes:

          (i) Sharing Medicare claims data for attributed beneficiaries with IOTA participants.

          (ii) Assessing each IOTA participant's performance across the achievement domain, efficiency domain, and quality domain.

          (iii) Determining performance-based payments paid to or by IOTA participants.

          (2) Once a kidney transplant waitlist patient or kidney transplant patient is attributed to an IOTA participant, that respective patient may not opt out of attribution to an IOTA participant and remains attributed to the IOTA participant for the duration of the model performance period, unless the attributed patient meets the de-attribution criteria under paragraph (b)(3) of this section during annual attribution reconciliation as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (b) —(1)  (i) At the time CMS conducts attribution, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, if a kidney transplant waitlist patient meets the definition of an IOTA waitlist patient, as defined at § 512.402, CMS attributes the kidney transplant waitlist patient as an IOTA waitlist patient to an IOTA participant.

          (ii) [Reserved]

          (2)  (i) At the time CMS conducts attribution, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, CMS attributes a kidney transplant patient as an IOTA transplant patient if the kidney transplant patient meets all of the following:

          (A) The definition of an IOTA transplant patient, as defined at § 512.402.

          (B) Is 18 years of age or older at the time of the patient's kidney transplant.

          (C) Is alive.

          (ii) [Reserved]

          (3)  During annual attribution reconciliation, CMS uses the fourth quarter attribution list for each IOTA participant and de-attributes any attributed patients who, as of the last day of the PY being reconciled, meet any of the following de-attribution criteria:

          (A) An IOTA waitlist patient that was removed from and remains unregistered on an IOTA participant's kidney transplant waitlist.

          (B) An IOTA waitlist patient that has died at any point during the PY.

          (C) An IOTA transplant patient that has died at any point during the PY.

          (D) An IOTA transplant patient who experiences transplant failure at any point during the model performance period and has not rejoined an IOTA participant's kidney transplant waitlist or received another transplant from an IOTA participant before the last day of the respective PY.

          (c)  CMS employs the following methodology to attribute kidney waitlist patients and kidney transplant patients to an IOTA participant after identifying all kidney waitlist patients and kidney transplant patients that meet the attribution criteria as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section:

          (1)(i)  Prior to the model start date, CMS conducts initial attribution, as defined at § 512.402.

          (ii)  (A) CMS provides the initial attribution list to the IOTA participant no later than 15 days prior to the start of PY 1 and in a form and manner as determined by CMS.

          (B) The initial attribution list includes a list of IOTA waitlist patients identified through initial attribution, effective on the model start date.

          (2)(i)  CMS conducts attribution, as defined at § 512.402, on a quarterly basis after the model start date, and updates the quarterly attribution list, as defined at § 512.402, for each IOTA participant, except in the event of termination in accordance with § 512.466.

          (ii)  CMS provides the quarterly attribution list, as defined at § 512.402, to the IOTA participant no later than 15 days prior to the start of each quarter and in a form and manner determined by CMS. The quarterly attribution list includes, at minimum, all of the following:

          (A) A list of all newly attributed patients, whose attribution to the IOTA participant becomes effective on the first day of the relevant upcoming quarter.

          (B) A list of all attributed patients who continue to be attributed to the IOTA participant from the previous quarter.

          (C) The dates in which attribution began, changed, or ended, where applicable for attributed patients.

          (D) The attributed patient's data sharing preferences under § 512.440(b).

          (3)(i)  After the fourth quarter of each PY, CMS conducts annual attribution reconciliation as defined at § 512.402.

          (ii)  CMS provides the annual reconciliation list to the IOTA participant before the second quarter of the following PY. Using the fourth quarter quarterly attribution list for each IOTA participant, the annual attribution reconciliation list identifies, at a minimum, all of the following, where applicable:

          (A) A list of all attributed patients who remain attributed to the IOTA participant because they satisfied the attribution criteria under §§ 512.414(b)(1) and (2) for the respective PY.

          (B) The dates in which attribution began, changed, or ended, where applicable.

          (C) A list of all attributed patients who are de-attributed because they failed to satisfy the attribution criteria under § 512.414(b)(1) and (2).

          (D) A list of all attributed patients who are de-attributed because they satisfy a de-attribution criterion under § 512.414(b)(3).

          (E) The dates on which each attributed patient satisfied a de-attribution criterion as specified under § 512.414(b)(3).

          (F) A list of the de-attribution criterion each attributed patient satisfied under § 512.414(b)(3).

        Performance Assessment and Scoring

          § 512.422   Overview of performance assessment and scoring.

#### § § 512.422

          (a)  (1) CMS establishes the performances measures described in §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428 to assess IOTA participants in the achievement domain, efficiency domain and quality domain.

          (2) CMS assigns each set of metrics within a domain a point value with the total possible points awarded to an IOTA participant across the three domains equaling 100, as described in §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428.

          (b)  (1) CMS uses Medicare claims data and Medicare administrative data about beneficiaries, providers, suppliers, and data from the OPTN, to calculate performance for the IOTA participant based on the methodologies under §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428.

          (2) CMS may also use model-specific data reported by an IOTA participant to CMS under the IOTA Model to calculate IOTA participant performance in the domains.

          § 512.424   Achievement domain.

#### § § 512.424

          (a)  (1) After each PY, CMS calculates the number of kidney transplants that each IOTA participant performed for the respective PY, in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (d) of this section.

          (2) CMS compares the number of kidney transplants that an IOTA participant performed during the PY to the IOTA participant's transplant target to determine the IOTA participant's score for the achievement domain.

          (b)  CMS determines the IOTA participant's transplant target for each PY as follows:

          (1)  CMS analyzes the baseline years for the relevant PY and identifies:

          (i) The mean number of deceased donor kidney transplants furnished by the IOTA participant to patients 18 years of age or older across the baseline years, as defined at § 512.402; and

          (ii) The mean number of living donor kidney transplants furnished by the IOTA participant to patients 18 years of age or older across the baseline years, as defined at § 512.402.

          (2)  CMS sums the numbers in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

          (3)  CMS calculates the national growth rate, as defined at § 512.402, using the baseline years for the relevant PY as follows:

          (i) Subtracts the total number of kidney transplants furnished to patients 18 years of age or older during the second baseline year from the total number of kidney transplants furnished to patients 18 years of age or older during the third baseline year.

          (ii) Divides the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section by the total number of kidney transplants furnished to patients 18 years of age or older during the third baseline year. The resulting amount is the national growth rate for the relevant PY.

          (4)  If the national growth rate calculated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is—

          (i) Positive, CMS multiples that national growth rate by the sum calculated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The resulting amount is an IOTA participant's transplant target for the relevant PY; or

          (ii) Negative, CMS does not multiply the national growth rate by the sum calculated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The IOTA participant's transplant target for the relevant PY is the sum calculated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

          (c)  CMS notifies the IOTA participant of the transplant target by the first day of the start of each PY in a form and manner determined by CMS.

          (d)  (1)(i) After each PY, CMS counts the number of kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant on patients who were 18 years of age or older at the time of transplant, during the PY.

          (ii) CMS identifies kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant using OPTN data, regardless of payer, and Medicare claims data.

          (2) CMS counts each kidney transplant described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as one transplant.

          (e) [Reserved]

          (f)  For each PY, CMS awards the IOTA participant zero to 60 points for its performance in the achievement domain.

          (1) CMS compares the total number of kidney transplants identified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section to the IOTA participant's transplant target, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (2) CMS uses the following scoring methodology to determine an IOTA participant's score on the achievement domain.

          § 512.426   Efficiency domain.

#### § § 512.426

          (a)  For each PY, CMS assesses each IOTA participant on the metric described in paragraph (b) of this section to determine the IOTA participant's score for the efficiency domain.

          (b)  For each PY, CMS assesses the IOTA participant on the following metric:

          (1)  For each PY, CMS calculates the organ-offer acceptance rate ratio by dividing the number of kidneys the IOTA participant accepted by the risk-adjusted number of expected organ-offer acceptances using SRTR's methodology as described in equation 1 to paragraph (b)(1) introductory text of this section.

          (i) CMS uses both of the following:

          (A) SRTR data to calculate the organ-offer acceptance rate ratio.

          (B) SRTR's adult kidney model strata risk-adjustment methodology and most available set of coefficients to calculate the number of expected organ-offer acceptances.

          (ii) CMS includes all of the following kidney offers when calculating the organ-offer acceptance rate ratio for the IOTA participant:

          (A) Offers that are ultimately accepted and transplanted.

          (B) Offers to candidates on a single organ waitlist (except for kidney/pancreas candidates that are also listed for kidney alone).

          (iii) CMS excludes the following kidney offers when calculating the organ-offer acceptance rate:

          (A) Offers with multiple match runs from the same donor combined and duplicate offers.

          (B) Offers with no match run acceptances.

          (C) Offers that occurred after the last acceptance in a match run.

          (D) Offers with a missing or bypassed response.

          (E) Offers to multi-organ candidates (except for kidney/pancreas candidates that are also listed for kidney alone).

          (c)  For each PY, CMS awards the IOTA participant 0 to 20 points for its performance in the efficiency domain.

          (1)  CMS determines the IOTA participant's score for the efficiency domain for each PY by taking the IOTA participant's score for the organ offer acceptance rate ratio, as described under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This number is the IOTA participant's score for the efficiency domain for the PY.

          (2)  CMS calculates the IOTA participant's achievement score, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and improvement score, as described under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, for the organ offer acceptance rate ratio, compares the IOTA participant's achievement score and improvement score and awards to the IOTA participant the points that correspond to the higher score.

          (i)  CMS calculates the IOTA participant's achievement score based on the IOTA participant's performance on organ offer acceptance rate ratio relative to national ranking, including all eligible kidney transplant hospitals, using the scoring methodology described in table 1 to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

          (ii)  CMS compares the IOTA participant's organ offer acceptance rate ratio during the PY, calculated as described under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, to the IOTA participant's improvement benchmark rate, calculated as described under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.

          (A)  CMS calculates an improvement benchmark rate for the IOTA participant. To determine an IOTA participant's improvement benchmark rate for a given PY, CMS multiplies an IOTA participant's organ offer acceptance rate ratio during the third baseline year by 120 percent.

          (B)  For each PY, CMS uses the following methodology to determine each IOTA participant's improvement score on the organ offer acceptance rate ratio:

          () If the IOTA participant's organ-offer acceptance rate ratio is greater than or equal to the improvement benchmark rate, CMS awards the IOTA participant _1_5 points in the efficiency domain.

          () If the IOTA participant's organ offer acceptance rate ratio is equal to or less than the IOTA participant's organ-offer acceptance rate ratio in the third baseline year for that respective PY, CMS awards the IOTA participant 0 points in the efficiency domain.

          () If the IOTA participant's organ offer acceptance rate ratio is greater than the IOTA participant's organ-offer acceptance rate ratio in the third baseline year for that respective PY but less than the improvement benchmark rate, CMS uses the following equation:

          § 512.428   Quality domain.

#### § § 512.428

          (a)  For each PY, CMS assesses each IOTA participant on the metric described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine the IOTA participant's quality domain score, as described under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, for the quality domain.

          (b)  For each PY, CMS assesses each IOTA participant using the following quality metrics:

          (1)  For each PY, CMS calculates an IOTA participant's composite graft survival rate by dividing the cumulative number of all functioning kidney grafts for the IOTA participant's IOTA transplant patients by the cumulative number of all kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant during the first PY and all subsequent PYs on patients 18 years or older at the time of the transplant, as described in equation 1 to paragraph (b)(1) introductory text of this section.

          (i) For the first PY, CMS calculates the IOTA participant's composite graft survival rate based solely on the number of functioning grafts furnished to IOTA transplant patients during that PY and the number of completed kidney transplants during that PY, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

          (ii) For all subsequent PYs, CMS calculates the IOTA participant's cumulative composite graft survival rate using the same calculation methodology described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

          (iii) CMS excludes the following from the numerator when calculating the composite graft survival rate:

          (A) Graft failure, based on OPTN adult kidney transplant recipient follow-up forms for all completed kidney transplants to determine failed grafts as defined by SRTR.

          (B) Re-transplant.

          (C) Death.

          (D) Patients who are under the age of 18 years of age at the time of the kidney transplant.

          (E) Offers to multi-organ candidates (except for kidney/pancreas candidates that are also listed for kidney alone).

          (iv)(A) When calculating the composite graft survival rate, CMS only includes kidney transplants for patients who are 18 years of age and older at the time of the kidney transplant in the number of kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant during each PY in the denominator.

          (B) CMS identifies kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant using OPTN data, regardless of payer, and Medicare claims data.

          (2)-(3) [Reserved]

          (c)  For each PY, CMS awards the IOTA participant zero to 20 points for the IOTA participant's performance in the quality domain, in accordance with the following:

          (1) For composite graft survival rate, as described under paragraph (d) of this section, the IOTA participant may receive up to 20 points.

          (2) [Reserved]

          (d)  CMS awards points to the IOTA participant based on the IOTA participant's performance on the composite graft survival rate, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, ranked nationally, inclusive of all eligible kidney transplant hospitals. CMS awards points to the IOTA participant for composite graft survival rate as described in table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section:

        Payment

          § 512.430   Upside risk payment, downside risk payment, and neutral zone.

#### § § 512.430

          (a)  CMS determines if an IOTA participant qualifies for an upside risk payment, downside risk payment, or the neutral zone for each PY based on the IOTA participant's final performance score, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.

          (b) —(1)  If in PYs 1-6 the IOTA participant's final performance score is 60 points or above, CMS calculates the IOTA participant's upside risk payment as follows:

          (i) Subtracts 60 from the IOTA participant's final performance score.

          (ii) Divides the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by 40.

          (iii) Multiplies the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section by $15,000.

          (iv) Multiplies the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section by the total number of Medicare kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant during the PY.

          (2)  (i) For PY 1, an IOTA participant with a final performance score below 60 points qualifies for the neutral zone and neither owes a downside risk payment to CMS nor receives an upside risk payment from CMS.

          (ii) For PYs 2 through 6, if an IOTA participant's final performance is between 41 to 59 points (inclusive), the IOTA participant qualifies for the neutral zone.

          (3)  If an IOTA participant is at or below 40 points in PYs 1 through 6, the IOTA participant qualifies for a downside risk payment. The downside risk payment is calculated as follows:

          (i) For PY 1, this paragraph does not apply, and the IOTA participant does not owe a downside risk payment to CMS.

          (ii) For PYs 2 through 6, CMS calculates the IOTA participant's downside risk payment as follows:

          (A) Subtracts the IOTA participant's final performance score from 40.

          (B) Divides the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section by 40.

          (C) Multiplies the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section by $2,000.

          (D) Multiplies the amount resulting from the calculation in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section by the total number of Medicare kidney transplants performed by the IOTA participant during the PY to calculate the amount of the IOTA participant's downside risk payment.

          (c) [Reserved]

          (d)  (1) CMS conducts and calculates preliminary performance assessment and payment calculations at least 3 to 6 months after the end of each PY.

          (2) CMS notifies the IOTA participant of their preliminary performance assessment and payment calculations in a form and manner determined by CMS at least 5 to 9 months after the end of each PY.

          (3) CMS gives IOTA participants 30 days to review preliminary performance assessment and payment calculations and request targeted reviews under § 512.434.

          (4) CMS notifies the IOTA participant of their final performance score and any associated upside risk payment or downside risk payment at least 30 days after notifying the IOTA participant of their preliminary performance assessment and payment calculations.

          (5)  After CMS notifies the IOTA participant of their final performance score and any associated upside risk payment, and by a date determined by CMS, CMS issues the upside risk payment to the tax identification number (TIN) on file for the IOTA participant in the Medicare Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS).

          (6)  After CMS notifies the IOTA participant of their final performance score and any associated downside risk payment and by a date determined by CMS, CMS issues a demand letter to the TIN on file for the IOTA participant in PECOS for any downside risk payment owed to CMS.

          (i) CMS includes all of the following details in the demand letter:

          (A) IOTA participant performance in the model.

          (B) Amount of downside risk payment owed to CMS by the IOTA participant.

          (C) How the IOTA participant may make payments to CMS.

          (ii) The IOTA participant must pay the downside risk payment to CMS in a single payment at least 60 days after the date which the demand letter is issued.

          § 512.434   Targeted review.

          (2) Include supporting information in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

          (c)  (1) CMS does not provide IOTA participants the ability to dispute the policy or methodology, as the targeted review process would be limited to the dispute of calculations. CMS would not consider targeted review requests regarding, without limitation, the following:

          (i) The selection of the kidney transplant hospital to be an IOTA participant.

          (ii) The attribution of IOTA waitlist patients and the attribution of IOTA transplant patients to the IOTA participant, or to any other kidney transplant hospital selected for participation in the IOTA Model, or to any kidney transplant hospital not selected for participation in the IOTA Model.

          (iii) The methodology used for determining the achievement domain, efficiency domain, and quality domain.

          (iv) The methodology used for calculating and assigning points for each metric within the achievement domain, efficiency domain, and quality domain.

          (v) The methodology used for calculating the payment amount per Medicare kidney transplant paid to an IOTA participant.

          (2) CMS may review a targeted review request that includes one or more of the limitations in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that all remaining considerations of the request meet all other criteria for consideration by CMS in this section.

          (d)  The IOTA participant must submit a request for targeted review in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. The process for a targeted review is as follows:

          (1)  Upon receipt of a targeted review request from an IOTA participant CMS conducts an initial and final assessment as follows:

          (i)  (A) CMS determines if the targeted review request meets the targeted review requirements in paragraph (b) of this section and contains sufficient information to substantiate the request.

          (B) If the request is not compliant with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section or requires additional information:

          () CMS follows up with the IOTA participant to request additional information in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

          () The IOTA participant must respond within 30 days of CMS's request for additional information in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

          () An IOTA participant's non-responsiveness to the request for additional information from CMS may result in the closure of the targeted review request.

          (ii)  (A) Upon completion of an initial assessment, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, CMS determines whether it erred in calculation, as disputed by the IOTA participant.

          (B) If a calculation error is found as a result of an IOTA participant's targeted review request—

          () CMS—

          () Not_i_fies the IOTA participant within 30 days of any findings in a form and manner as specified by CMS; and

          () Resolves and corrects any resulting error or discrepancy in the amount of the upside risk payment or downside risk payment in a time and manner as determined by CMS.

          () CMS' correction of any error or discrepancy may delay the effective date of an IOTA participant's upside risk payments or downside risk payments.

          (2)  Targeted review decisions made by CMS are final, unless submitted for administrative review as described in § 512.190.

          § 512.436   Extreme and uncontrollable circumstances.

#### § § 512.436

          (a)  CMS—

          (1) Applies determinations made under the Quality Payment Program with respect to whether an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance has occurred and the affected area during the PY; and

          (2) Has sole discretion to determine the period during which an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance occurred and the percentage of attributed patients residing in affected areas.

          (b)  In the event of an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance, as determined by the Quality Payment Program, CMS may reduce the amount of the IOTA participant's downside risk payment, if applicable, prior to recoupment. CMS determines the amount of the reduction by multiplying the downside risk payment by both of the following:

          (1) The percentage of total months during the PY affected by the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance.

          (2) The percentage of attributed patients who reside in an area affected by the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance.

          § 512.537   Determination of the episode.

#### § § 512.537

          (a)  (1) An episode ends on the 30th day following the date of the anchor procedure or the date of discharge from the anchor hospitalization, as applicable, with the date of the anchor procedure or the date of discharge from the anchor hospitalization being counted as the first day in the 30-day post-discharge period.

          (b)  The episode is canceled and is not included in the reconciliation calculation as specified in § 512.545 if any of the following occur:

          (1) The beneficiary ceases to meet any criterion listed in § 512.535.

          (2) The beneficiary dies during the anchor hospitalization or the outpatient stay for the anchor procedure.

          (3) The episode qualifies for cancellation due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances. An extreme and uncontrollable circumstance occurs if both of the following criteria are met:

        Pricing Methodology

          § 512.540   Determination of preliminary target prices.

#### § § 512.540

          (a)  CMS establishes preliminary target prices for TEAM participants for each performance year of the model as follows:

          (1)  CMS uses the MS-DRGs and, as applicable, HCPCS codes specified in § 512.525(d) when calculating the preliminary target prices for each _MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type._

          (i) CMS determines a separate preliminary target price for each of the 24 MS-DRGs specified in § 512.525(d).

          (ii) Preliminary target prices for a subset of the MS-DRGs specified in § 512.525(d) include certain HCPCS codes as follows:

          (A) HCPCS 27130 and 27447 are included in MS-DRG 470.

          (B) HCPCS 27702 is included in MS-DRG 469.

          (C) HCPCS 22551 and 22554 are included in MS-DRG 473.

          (D) HCPCS 22612 and 22630 are included in MS-DRG 451.

          (E) HCPCS 22633 is included in MS-DRG 402.

          (2)  CMS calculates preliminary target prices for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type and region for each performance year and applies the preliminary target price to each episode based on the episode's date of discharge from the anchor hospitalization or the episode's date of the anchor procedure, as applicable.

          (3)  CMS applies the preliminary target price to the episode based on the date of discharge from the anchor hospitalization or the date of the anchor procedure, as applicable, but reconciles the episode based on the end date of the episode.

          (b)  (1) CMS calculates preliminary target prices based on average baseline episode spending for the region where the TEAM participant is located.

          (i) The region used for calculating the preliminary target price corresponds to the U.S. Census Division associated with the primary address of the CCN of the TEAM participant, and the regional episode spending amount is based on all hospitals in the region, except as specified in § 512.540(b)(1)(ii).

          (ii) In cases where a TEAM participant is located in a mandatory CBSA selected for participation in TEAM which spans more than one region, the TEAM participant and all other hospitals in the mandatory CBSA are grouped into the region where the most populous city in the mandatory CBSA is located for pricing and payment calculations.

          (2) CMS uses the following baseline periods to determine baseline episode spending:

          (i) Performance Year 1: Episodes beginning on January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024.

          (ii) Performance Year 2: Episodes beginning on January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025.

          (iii) Performance Year 3: Episodes beginning on January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026.

          (iv) Performance Year 4: Episodes beginning on January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027.

          (v) Performance Year 5: Episodes beginning on January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2028.

          (3) CMS calculates the benchmark price as the weighted average of baseline episode spending, applying the following weights:

          (i) Baseline episode spending from baseline year 1 is weighted at 17 percent.

          (ii) Baseline episode spending from baseline year 2 is weighted at 33 percent.

          (iii) Baseline episode spending from baseline year 3 is weighted at 50 percent.

          (4)  CMS applies a high-cost outlier cap to baseline episode spending at the 99th percentile of regional spending for each of the MS-DRG/HCPCS episode types specified in § 512.540(a)(1)(ii).

          (5)  Certain Medicare incentive programs and add-on payments are excluded from baseline episode spending by using, with certain modifications, the CMS Price (Payment) Standardization Detailed Methodology used for the Medicare spending per beneficiary measure in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program.

          (6)  Based on the episodes in the most recent calendar year of the baseline period, CMS calculates a prospective normalization factor, which is a multiplier that ensures that the average risk adjusted target price does not exceed the average unadjusted target price, by doing the following:

          (i) CMS applies risk adjustment multipliers, as specified in § 512.545(a)(1) through (3), to the most recent baseline year episodes to calculate the estimated risk-adjusted target price for all performance year episodes.

          (ii) CMS divides the mean of the preliminary target price for each episode across all hospitals and regions by the mean of the estimated risk-adjusted target price calculated in § 512.540(b)(6)(i) for the same episode types across all hospitals and regions.

          (7)  CMS calculates the following:

          (i) The average regional episode spending for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type using the most recent calendar year of the applicable baseline period.

          (ii) The difference between the average regional spending for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type during the most recent calendar year of the baseline period and the average regional spending for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type during the first years of the baseline period to determine the prospective trend factor.

          (8)  CMS communicates the preliminary target prices for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type for each region to the TEAM participant before the performance year in which they apply.

          (c)  CMS incorporates an episode category specific discount factor of 1.5 percent for CABG and Major Bowel episodes and 2 percent for LEJR, SHFFT, and Spinal Fusion episodes to the TEAM participant's preliminary episode target prices intended to reflect Medicare's potential savings from TEAM.

          § 512.545   Determination of reconciliation target prices.

#### § § 512.545

          CMS calculates the reconciliation target price as follows:

          (a) CMS risk adjusts the preliminary episode target prices computed under § 512.540 at the beneficiary level using a TEAM Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) count risk adjustment factor, an age bracket risk adjustment factor, a social need risk adjustment factor, and at the hospital level using a hospital bed size risk adjustment factor and a safety net hospital risk adjustment factor, and at the episode category-specific beneficiary level using factors specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) through (v) of this section.

          (1) The TEAM HCC count risk adjustment factor uses five variables, representing beneficiaries with zero, one, two, three, or four or more CMS-HCC conditions based on a lookback period that ends on the day prior to the anchor hospitalization or anchor procedure.

          (2) The age bracket risk adjustment factor uses four variables, representing beneficiaries in the following age groups as of the first day of the episode:

          (i) Less than 65 years.

          (ii) 65 to less than 75 years.

          (iii) 75 years to less than 85 years.

          (iv) 85 years or more.

          (3) The social need risk adjustment factor uses two variables, representing beneficiaries that, as of the first day of the episode—

          (i) Meet one or more of the following measures of social need:

          (A) State ADI above the 8th decile.

          (B) National ADI above the 80th percentile.

          (C) Eligibility for the low-income subsidy.

          (D) Eligibility for full Medicaid benefits.

          (ii) Do not meet any of the three measures of social need in § 512.545(a)(1)(iii)(A).

          (4) The hospital bed size risk adjustment factor uses four variables based on the TEAM participant's characteristics:

          (i) 250 beds or fewer.

          (ii) 251-500 beds.

          (iii) 501-850 beds.

          (iv) 850 beds or more.

          (5) The safety net hospital risk adjustment factor is based on the TEAM participant meeting the definition of safety net hospital, as defined in § 512.505.

          (6) Episode category-specific beneficiary level risk adjustment factors represent the presence or absence in beneficiaries, as of the first day of the episode, of each of the following conditions:

          (M) HCC 134: Dialysis Status.

          (b) All risk adjustment factors are computed prior to the start of the performance year via a linear regression analysis. The regression analysis is computed using 3 years of claims data as follows:

          (1) For performance year 1, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024.

          (2) For performance year 2, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025.

          (3) For performance year 3, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026.

          (4) For performance year 4, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2027.

          (5) For performance year 5, CMS uses claims data with dates of service dated January 1, 2026 to December 30, 2028.

          (c) The annual linear regression analysis produces exponentiated coefficients to determine the anticipated marginal effect of each risk adjustment factor on episode costs. CMS transforms, or exponentiates, these coefficients, and the resulting coefficients are the beneficiary and hospital-level risk adjustment factors, specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section, that would be used during reconciliation for the subsequent performance year.

          (d) At the time of reconciliation, the preliminary target prices computed under § 512.540 are risk adjusted by applying the applicable beneficiary level and hospital-level risk adjustment factors specific to the beneficiary in the episode, as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.

          (e) The risk-adjusted preliminary target prices are normalized at reconciliation to ensure that the average of the total risk-adjusted preliminary target price does not exceed the average of the total non-risk adjusted preliminary target price.

          (1) The final normalization factor at reconciliation—

          (i) Is the national mean of the benchmark price for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type divided by the national mean of the risk-adjusted benchmark price for the same MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type.

          (ii) As applied, cannot exceed ±5 percent of the prospective normalization factor (as specified in § 512.540(b)(6)).

          (2) CMS applies the final normalization factor to the previously calculated, beneficiary and provider level, risk-adjusted target prices specific to each region and MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type.

          (f)  CMS calculates the average regional capped performance year episode spending for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type divided by the average regional capped baseline period episode spending for each MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type.

          (1) The retrospective trend factor is capped so that the maximum difference cannot exceed ±3 percent of the prospective trend factor (as specified in § 512.540(b)(7)).

          (2) CMS applies the capped retrospective trend factor to the previously calculated normalized, risk adjusted target prices specific to each region and MS-DRG/HCPCS episode type, as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, to calculate the reconciliation target prices, which are compared to performance year spending at reconciliation, as specified in § 512.550(c).

        Quality Measures and Composite Quality Score

          § 512.547   Quality measures, composite quality score, and display of quality measures.

#### § § 512.547

          (a)  CMS calculates the quality measures used to evaluate the TEAM participant's performance using Medicare claims data or patient-reported outcomes data that TEAM participants report under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program. The following quality measures and CQS baseline periods are used for public reporting and for determining the TEAM participant's CQS as described in paragraph (b) of this section:

          (1) For performance year 1:

          (b)  (1) CMS converts the TEAM participant's raw quality measure score for the performance year into a scaled quality measure score by comparing the raw quality measure score to the distribution of raw quality measure score percentiles among a national cohort of hospitals, consisting of TEAM participants and hospitals not participating in TEAM, in the CQS baseline period.

          (i) CMS assigns a scaled quality measure score equal to the percentile to which the TEAM Participant's raw quality measure score would have belonged in the CQS baseline period.

          (A) CMS assigns the higher scaled quality measure score if the TEAM participant's raw quality measure score straddles two percentiles in the CQS baseline period.

          (B) For the Hospital-Level Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA) Patient-Reported Outcome-Based Performance Measure (PRO-PM) (CMIT ID #1618):

          () CMS assigns a scaled quality measure score of _1_00 if the TEAM participant's raw quality measure score is greater than the maximum of the raw quality measure scores in the CQS baseline period.

          () CMS assigns a scaled quality measure score of 0 if the raw quality measure score is less than the minimum of the raw quality measure scores in the baseline period.

          (C) For the Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Readmission Measure with Claims and Electronic Health Record Data (CMIT ID #356) measure, the CMS Patient Safety and Adverse Events Composite (CMS PSI 90) (CMIT ID #135) measure, the Hospital Harm—Falls with Injury (CMIT ID #1518) measure, the Hospital Harm—Postoperative Respiratory Failure (CMIT ID #1788) measure, and the Thirty-day Risk-Standardized Death Rate among Surgical Inpatients with Complications (Failure-to-Rescue) (CMIT ID #134) measure:

          () CMS assigns a scaled quality measure score of 0 if the TEAM participant has a raw quality measure score greater than the maximum of the raw quality measure scores in the CQS baseline period.

          () CMS assigns a scaled quality measure score of 100 if the TEAM participant has a raw quality score less than the minimum of the raw scores in the CQS baseline period.

          (D) CMS does not assign a scaled quality measure score if the TEAM participant has no raw quality measure score.

          (2) CMS calculates a normalized weight for each quality measure by dividing the TEAM participant's volume of attributed episodes for a given quality measure by the total volume of all the TEAM participant's attributed episodes.

          (3) CMS calculates a weighted scaled score for each quality measure by multiplying each quality measure's scaled quality measure score, computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, by its normalized weight, computed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (4) CMS sums each quality measure's weighted scaled score, computed under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to construct the CQS.

          (c)  CMS does all of the following:

          (1) Displays quality measure results on the publicly available CMS website that is specific to TEAM, in a form and manner consistent with other publicly reported measures.

          (2) Shares quality measures with the TEAM participant prior to display on the CMS website.

          (3) Uses the following time periods to share quality measure performance:

          (i) Quality measure performance in performance year 1 is reported in 2027.

          (ii) Quality measure performance in performance year 2 is reported in 2028.

          (iii) Quality measure performance in performance year 3 is reported in 2029.

          (iv) Quality measure performance in performance year 4 is reported in 2030.

          (v) Quality measure performance in performance year 5 is reported in 2031.

        Reconciliation and Review Process

          § 512.550   Reconciliation process and determination of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

#### § § 512.550

          (a)  Providers and suppliers furnishing items and services included in the episode bill for such items and services in accordance with existing Medicare rules.

          (b)  Six months after the end of each performance year, CMS does the following:

          (1) Performs a reconciliation calculation to establish a reconciliation payment or repayment amount for each TEAM participant.

          (2) For TEAM participants that experience a reorganization event in which one or more hospitals reorganize under the CCN of a TEAM participant, performs—

          (i) Separate reconciliation calculations for each predecessor TEAM participant for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or the anchor procedure occurred before the effective date of the reorganization event; and

          (ii) Reconciliation calculations for each new or surviving TEAM participant for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or anchor procedure occurred on or after the effective date of the reorganization event.

          (c)  CMS compares the reconciliation target prices described in § 512.545 and the TEAM participant's performance year spending to establish a reconciliation amount for the TEAM participant for each performance year as follows:

          (1) CMS determines the performance year spending for each episode included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 512.537(b)) using claims data that is available 6 months after the end of the performance year.

          (2) CMS calculates and applies the high-cost outlier cap for performance year episode spending by applying the calculation described in § 512.540(b)(4) to performance year episode spending.

          (3) CMS applies the adjustments specified in § 512.545 to the preliminary target prices computed in accordance with § 512.540 to calculate the reconciliation target prices.

          (4) CMS aggregates the reconciliation target prices computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for all episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 512.537(b)).

          (5) CMS subtracts the performance year spending amount determined under paragraph (c)(1-2) of this section from the aggregated reconciliation target price amount determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to determine the reconciliation amount.

          (d)  CMS adjusts the reconciliation amount based on the Composite Quality Score as follows:

          (1) CMS calculates a CQS adjustment percentage based on a TEAM participant's CQS, computed in accordance with § 512.547(b).

          (i) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 1.

          (ii) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts and up to 15 percent for negative reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 2.

          (iii) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts and up to 10 percent for negative reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 3.

          (2) CMS multiplies the CQS adjustment percentage, computed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, by the TEAM participant's positive or negative reconciliation amount calculated in paragraph (c) of this section to construct the CQS adjustment amount.

          (3) CMS subtracts the CQS adjustment amount, computed from paragraph (d)(2) of this section, from the positive or negative reconciliation amount calculated in paragraph (c) of this section to construct the quality-adjusted reconciliation amount.

          (e)  CMS applies stop-loss and stop gain limits to the quality-adjusted reconciliation amount computed in paragraph (d) of this section to calculate the NPRA as follows:

          (1)  For TEAM participants in Track 3, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the repayment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year. The post-episode spending calculation amount in paragraph (f) of this section is not subject to the limitation on loss.

          (2)  (i) For TEAM participants in Track 1, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 10 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.

          (ii) For TEAM participants in Tracks 2, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 5 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.

          (iii) For TEAM participants in Track 3, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.

          (iv) The post-episode spending amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section is not subject to the limitation on gain.

          (3)  For performance years 2-5, the repayment amount for a TEAM participant in Track 2 defined at § 512.505, must not exceed 5 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

          (f)  CMS calculates the post-episode spending amount as follows: If the average post-episode spending amount for a TEAM participant in the performance year being reconciled is greater than 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode spending amount for the performance year, then the post-episode spending amount that exceeds 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode spending amount for the performance year is subtracted from the NPRA for that performance year.

          (g)  (1) CMS applies the results of the post-episode spending calculation set forth in paragraph (f) of this section to the NPRA as follows:

          (i) For TEAM participants whose post-episode spending amount does not exceed the limit calculated in paragraph (f) of this section, the reconciliation payment or repayment amount is equal to the NPRA.

          (ii) If the TEAM participant's post-episode spending exceeds the limit calculated in paragraph (f) of this section, CMS subtracts the amount of post-episode spending exceeding the limit from the NPRA to calculate the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

          (2) If the amount calculated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is positive, the TEAM participant is owed a reconciliation payment in that amount, to be paid by CMS in one lump sum payment.

          (3) If the amount calculated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is negative, CMS determines the repayment amount as follows:

          (i) For TEAM participants in Track 1, the TEAM participant does not owe a repayment amount.

          (ii) For TEAM participants in Track 2 or Track 3 for Performance Years 1-5, as applicable, the Team participant owes that amount as a repayment to CMS.

          (h)  CMS issues each TEAM participant a TEAM reconciliation report for the performance year. Each TEAM reconciliation report contains the following:

          (1) The total performance year spending for the TEAM participant.

          (2) The TEAM participant's reconciliation target prices.

          (3) The TEAM participant's reconciliation amount.

          (4) The TEAM participant's composite quality score calculated in accordance with § 512.547(b).

          (5) The TEAM participant's quality-adjusted reconciliation amount.

          (6) The stop-loss and stop-gain limits that apply to the TEAM participant.

          (7) The TEAM participant's NPRA.

          (8) The TEAM participant's post-episode spending amount, if applicable.

          (9) The amount of any reconciliation payment owed to the TEAM participant or repayment owed by the TEAM participant to CMS for the performance year, if applicable.

          § 512.552   Treatment of incentive programs or add-on payments under existing Medicare payment systems.

#### § § 512.552

          The TEAM does not replace any existing Medicare incentive programs or add-on payments. The TEAM payments are independent of, and do not affect, any incentive programs or add-on payments under existing Medicare payment systems.

          § 512.555   Proration of payments for services that extend beyond an episode.

#### § § 512.555

          (a)  CMS prorates services included in the episode that extend beyond the episode so that only those portions of the services that were furnished during the episode are included in the calculation of the actual episode payments.

          (b)  CMS prorates payments for services that extend beyond the episode for the purposes of calculating both baseline episode spending and performance year spending using the following methodology:

          (1)  Non-IPPS inpatient services that extend beyond the end of the episode are prorated according to the percentage of the actual length of stay (in days) that falls within the episode.

          (2)  Home health agency services paid under the Medicare prospective payment system in accordance with part 484, subpart E of this chapter that extend beyond the episode are prorated according to the percentage of days, starting with the first billable service date and through and including the last billable service date, that occur during the episode.

          (3)  IPPS services that extend beyond the end of the episode are prorated according to the MS-DRG geometric mean length of stay, using the following methodology:

          (i) The first day of the IPPS stay is counted as 2 days.

          (ii) If the actual length of stay that occurred during the episode is equal to or greater than the MS-DRG geometric mean, the full MS-DRG payment is allocated to the episode.

          (iii) If the actual length of stay that occurred during the episode is less than the MS-DRG geometric mean length of stay, the MS-DRG payment amount is allocated to the episode based on the number of inpatient days that fall within the episode.

          (4) If the full amount of the payment is not allocated to the episode, any remainder amount is allocated to the post-episode spending calculation (defined in § 512.550(f)).

          § 512.560   Appeals process.

#### § § 512.560

          (a)  Subject to the limitations on review in § 512.594, if a TEAM participant wishes to dispute calculations involving a matter related to payment, reconciliation amounts, repayment amounts, the use of quality measure results in determining the composite quality score, or the application of the composite quality score during reconciliation, the TEAM participant is required to provide written notice of the calculation error, in a form and manner and by a date specified by CMS.

          (1) Unless the TEAM participant provides such written notice, CMS deems the TEAM reconciliation report to be final 30 calendar days after it is issued and proceeds with the payment or repayment processes as applicable.

          (2) If CMS receives a notice of a calculation error within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the TEAM reconciliation report, CMS responds in writing within 30 calendar days to either confirm that there was an error in the calculation or verify that the calculation is correct. CMS reserves the right to extend the time for its response upon written notice to the TEAM participant.

          (3) Only TEAM participants may use the calculation error process described in this part.

          (b)  If the TEAM participant contests a matter that does not involve an issue contained in, or a calculation that contributes to, a TEAM reconciliation report, a notice of calculation error is not required. In these instances, if CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the TEAM participant within 10 calendar days of the notice of the initial reconciliation, the initial determination is deemed final and CMS proceeds with the action indicated in the initial determination. This does not apply to the limitations on review in § 512.594.

          § 512.561   Reconsideration review processes.

        (a)  To determine whether the State is complying with the Federal requirements and the provisions of its BHP Blueprint, HHS may review, as needed, but no less frequently than annually, the compliance of the State BHP with applicable laws, regulations and interpretive guidance. This review may be based on the State's annual report submitted under § 600.170, or may be based on direct Federal review of State administration of the BHP Blueprint through analysis of the State's policies and procedures, reviews of agency operation, examination of samples of individual case records, and additional reports and/or data as determined by the Secretary.

        (b)  The compliance review will identify the following action items:

        (1) Requirements that need further study or data to assess continued State compliance with Federal law, regulations and the terms of the State's certified Blueprint. Such findings must be addressed in the next State annual report due no more than 120 days after the date of the issuance of the Federal compliance review.

        (2) Requirements with which the State BHP does not appear to be in compliance that could be the basis for withdrawal of BHP certification. Such findings must be resolved by the State (either by substantiating compliance with the standards for certification or submitting revisions to the Blueprint). If not resolved, such action items can be the basis for a proposed finding for withdrawal of BHP certification.

        (3) Requirements with which the State BHP does not appear to be in compliance and are not a basis for withdrawal of BHP certification but require revision to the Blueprint must be resolved by the State. If not resolved, such action items can be the basis for denial of other Blueprint revisions.

        (4)  The State and the BHP trustees shall be given an opportunity to review and resolve concerns regarding improper use of BHP trust funds, including failure to use these funds as specified in § 600.705. As indicated in § 600.715(a) through (c), the state may do this either by substantiating the proper use of trust fund resources as specified in § 600.705(c) or by taking corrective action, which include changes to procedures to ensure proper use of trust fund resources, and restitution of improperly used resources to the trust fund.

        (c) The HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) may periodically audit State operations and standard health plan practices as described in § 430.33 of this chapter. Final reports on those audits shall be transmitted to both the State and the Secretary for actions on findings. The State and the BHP trustees shall be given an opportunity to resolve concerns about improper use of BHP trust funds as indicated in § 600.715(a) through (c): either by substantiating the proper use of trust fund, or by taking corrective action that includes changes to procedures to ensure proper use of trust fund resources, and restitution of improperly used resources to the trust fund.

      Subpart G—Payment to States

        § 600.600   Basis, scope, and applicability.

#### § § 600.600

        (a)  This subpart implements section 1331(d)(1) and (3) of the Affordable Care Act regarding the transfer of Federal funds to a State's BHP trust fund and the Federal payment amount to a State for the provision of BHP.

        (b)  This subpart consists of provisions relating to the methodology used to calculate the amount of payment to a state in a given Federal fiscal year for the provision of BHP and the process and procedures by which the Secretary establishes a State's BHP payment amount.

        § 600.605   BHP payment methodology.

#### § § 600.605

        (a)  The Federal payment for an eligible individual in a given Federal fiscal year is the sum of the premium tax credit component, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the cost-sharing reduction component, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (1)  The premium tax credit component equals 95 percent of the premium tax credit for which the eligible individual would have qualified had he or she been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange in a given calendar year, adjusted by the relevant factors described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2)  The cost-sharing reduction component equals 95 percent of the cost of the cost-sharing reductions for which the eligible individual would have qualified had he or she been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange in a given calendar year adjusted by the relevant factors described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  In determining the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction components described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will consider the following factors to determine applicable adjustments:

        (1) Age of the enrollee;

        (2) Income of the enrollee;

        (3) Self-only or family coverage;

        (4) Geographic differences in average spending for health care across rating areas;

        (5) Health status of the enrollee for purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance payments had the enrollee been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange;

        (6) Reconciliation of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions had such reconciliation occurred if an enrollee had been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange;

        (7) Marketplace experience in other states with respect to Exchange participation and the effect of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions provided to residents, particularly those residents with income below 200 percent of the FPL; and

        (8) Other factors affecting the development of the methodology as determined by the Secretary.

        (c)  The Secretary will adjust the payment methodology on a prospective basis to adjust for any changes in the calculation of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction components to the extent that necessary data is available for the Secretary to prospectively determine all relevant factors, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 600.610   Secretarial determination of BHP payment amount.

#### § § 600.610

        (a)  (1) Beginning in FY 2015, the Secretary will determine and publish in a  document the BHP payment methodology for the next calendar year or, beginning in calendar year 2022, for multiple calendar years. Beginning in calendar year 2023—

        (i) In years in which the Secretary does not publish a new BHP methodology, the Secretary will update the values of factors needed to calculate the Federal BHP payments via sub regulatory guidance, as appropriate.

        (ii) In years that the Secretary publishes a revised payment methodology, the Secretary will publish a proposed BHP payment methodology upon receiving certification from the Chief Actuary of CMS.

        (2) A State may be required to submit data in accordance with the published proposed payment document in order for the Secretary to determine the State's payment rate as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Beginning in calendar year 2023, in years that the Secretary publishes a revised payment methodology, the Secretary will determine and publish the final BHP payment methodology and BHP payment amounts in a  document.

        (2)  State payment rates are determined by the Secretary using the final BHP payment methodology, data requested in the proposed payment notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, and, if needed, other applicable data as determined by the Secretary.

        (c) —(1)  The Secretary will determine, on a quarterly basis, the prospective aggregate BHP payment amount by multiplying the payment rates described in paragraph (b) of this section by the projected number of enrollees. This calculation would be made for each category of enrollees based on enrollee characteristics and the other relevant factors considered when determining the payment methodology. The prospective aggregate BHP payment amount would be the sum of the payments determined for each category of enrollees for a State.

        (2)  (i) Sixty days after the end of each fiscal year quarter, the Secretary will calculate a retrospective adjustment to the previous quarter's specific aggregate payment amount by multiplying the payment rates described in paragraph (b) of this section by actual enrollment for the respective quarter. This calculation would be made for each category of enrollees based on enrollee characteristics and the other relevant factors considered when determining the payment methodology. The adjusted BHP payment amount would be the sum of the payments determined for each category of enrollees for a State.

        (ii) Upon determination that a mathematical error occurred during the application or development of the BHP funding methodology, the Secretary will recalculate the state's BHP payment amount and make any necessary adjustments in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.

        (iii) To the extent that the final payment notice described in paragraph (b) of this section permits retrospective adjustments to the state's BHP payment amount (due to the lack of necessary data for the Secretary to prospectively determine the relevant factors comprising the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions components of the BHP funding methodology), the Secretary will recalculate the state's BHP payment amount and make any necessary adjustments in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.

        (iv) Any difference in the adjusted payment and the prospective aggregate payment amount will result in either:

        (A) A deposit of the difference amount into the State's BHP trust fund; or

        (B) A reduction in the upcoming quarter's prospective aggregate payment as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the difference amount.

When HHS determines that federal BHP funding is not allowable, HHS will provide written notice to the state and BHP Trustees containing:

        (1) The date or dates of the improper expenditures from the BHP trust fund;

        (2) A brief written explanation of the basis for the determination that the expenditures were improper; and

        (3) Procedures for administrative reconsideration of the disallowance based on a final determination.

        (e)  (1) BHP Trustees or the State may request reconsideration of a disallowance within 60 days after receipt of the disallowance notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section by submitting a written request for review, along with any relevant evidence, documentation, or explanation, to HHS.

        (2) After receipt of a reconsideration request, if the Secretary (or a designated hearing officer) determines that further proceedings would be warranted, the Secretary may issue a request for further information by a specific date, or may schedule a hearing to obtain further evidence or argument.

        (3) The Secretary, or designee, shall issue a final decision within 90 days after the later of the date of receipt of the reconsideration request or date of the last scheduled proceeding or submission.

        (f)  Disallowed federal BHP funding must be returned to HHS within 60 days after the later of the date of the disallowance notice or the final administrative reconsideration upholding the disallowance. Such repayment cannot be made from BHP trust funds, but must be made with other, non-Federal funds.
