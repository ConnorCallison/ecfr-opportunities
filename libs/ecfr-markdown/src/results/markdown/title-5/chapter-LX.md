    § 7001.101   General.

#### § § 7001.101

    In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635, as applied to employees of the United States Postal Service (Postal Service). Postal Service employees are subject, in addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, to the executive branch financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, and to any rules of conduct issued separately by the Postal Service, including but not limited to regulations contained in 39 CFR part 447, the Postal Service's Employee and Labor Relations Manual, and the Postal Service's Procurement Manual.

    § 7001.102   Restrictions on outside employment and business activities.

#### § § 7001.102

    (a)  No Postal Service employee shall:

    (1) Engage in outside employment or business activities that involve providing consultation, advice, or any subcontracting service, with respect to the operations, programs, or procedures of the Postal Service, to any person who has a contract with the Postal Service or who the employee has reason to believe will compete for such a contract;

    (2) Except as permitted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, engage in outside employment or business activities with, for, or as a person engaged in:

    (ii) The delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter, except daily newspapers.

    United Parcel Service (UPS), Federal Express (FedEx), Amazon, or DHL offers a part-time job to a Postal Service employee. Because UPS, FedEx, Amazon and DHL are persons engaged in the delivery outside the mails of mailable matter (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) that is not daily newspapers, the employee may not engage in employment with UPS, FedEx, Amazon, or DHL in any location in any capacity while continuing employment with the Postal Service in any location in any capacity. If the employee chooses to work for UPS, FedEx, Amazon, or DHL, the employee must end his or her postal employment before commencing work for that company.

    (3) Engage in any fundraising (as defined in 5 CFR 2635.808(a)(1)), for-profit business activity, or sales activity, including the solicitation of business or the receipt of orders, for oneself or any other person, while on duty or in uniform, at any postal facility, or using any postal equipment. This paragraph does not prohibit an employee from engaging in fundraising at a postal facility as permitted in connection with the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) under 5 CFR part 950.

    (b) —(1)  A Postal Service employee shall obtain approval from the Postal Service's Ethics Office in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section prior to:

    (i) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with or for any person with whom the employee has official dealings on behalf of the Postal Service;

    (ii) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with, for, or as a person who has interests that are:

    (A) Substantially dependent upon, or potentially affected to a significant degree by, postal rates, fees, or classifications; or

    (B) Substantially dependent upon providing goods or services to, or for use in connection with, the Postal Service; or

    (iii) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with or for any Highway Contract Route (HCR) contractor.

    (2)  If an entity with which an employee wishes to engage in outside employment or business activities is a subsidiary of an entity that is engaged in one the activities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but does not itself engage in any those activities, the employee may request approval from the Postal Service's Ethics Office to engage in such activity. The employee's request should follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and will be evaluated under the standard set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

    (3)  An employee who wishes to engage in outside employment or business activities for which approval is required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit a written request for approval to the Postal Service's Ethics Office. The request shall be accompanied by a statement from the employee's supervisor briefly summarizing the employee's duties and stating any workplace concerns raised by the employee's request for approval. The request for approval shall include:

    (i) A brief description of the employee's official duties;

    (ii) The name of the outside employer, or a statement that the employee will be engaging in employment or business activities on his or her own behalf;

    (v) A description of the employee's official dealings, if any, with the outside employer on behalf of the Postal Service; and

    (vi) Any additional information requested by the Postal Service's Ethics Office that is needed to determine whether approval should be granted.

    (4)  The approval required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or business activities will not involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635, which includes, among other provisions, the principle stated at 5 CFR 2635.101(b)(14) that employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in part 2635.

    (c) —(1)  A Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) employee shall report compensated and uncompensated outside employment or business activities to the OIG's Office of General Counsel, including:

    (i) Any knowing sale or lease of real estate to the Postal Service or to a Postal Service employee or contractor, regardless of the frequency of such sales or leases or whether the sale or lease is at fair market value;

    (ii) Any ownership or control of a publicly-accessible online or physical storefront; and

    (iii) Volunteer activities, if they regularly exceed 20 hours per week or when the employee holds an officer position in the organization.

    (2)  A Special Agent or Criminal Investigator shall also request and obtain written approval prior to engaging in outside employment or business activities which he or she is required to report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A request for approval shall be submitted to the OIG's Office of General Counsel, which will be reviewed under the same standard stated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

    (3)  The OIG's Office of General Counsel may issue internal instructions governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment, business activities, and volunteer activities. The instructions may exempt categories of employment, business activities, or volunteer activities from the reporting and prior approval requirements of this section based on a determination that those activities would generally be approved and are not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The OIG's Office of General Counsel may include in these instructions examples of outside activities that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.

#### § § 7001.103

    Section 440 of title 18, United States Code, makes it unlawful for any Postal Service employee to become interested in any contract for carrying the mail, or to act as agent, with or without compensation, for any contractor or person offering to become a contractor in any business before the Postal Service.

    § 7001.104   Prohibited financial interests of the members of the Board of Governors.

#### § § 7001.104

    (a)  (1) No member of the Board of Governors, which includes the Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, and the nine appointed Governors of the United States Postal Service, or any spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors, shall acquire or hold, directly or indirectly:

    (i) Any financial interest in a person engaged in the delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter, except daily newspapers; or

    (ii) Any financial interest in a publicly-traded entity engaged primarily in the business of leasing real property to the Postal Service.

A member of the Board of Governors actively controls the financial interests of an entity if he or she selects or dictates the entity's investments, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or funds. A member of the Board of Governors does not actively control the financial interests of an entity if he or she merely directs the investment strategy of the entity, hires the entity's financial manager(s) who selects the entity's investments, or designates another employee of the entity to select the entity's investments. A member of the Board of Governors may have such investment authority when serving as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee of an entity.

    (b)  Paragraph (a) of this section does not prohibit any member of the Board of Governors or spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors from directly or indirectly acquiring or holding, or a member of the Board of Governors from actively controlling on behalf of any entity, any financial interest in any publicly-traded or publicly-available mutual fund (as defined in 5 CFR 2640.102(k)) or other collective investment fund, including a widely-held pension or other retirement fund, that includes any financial interest described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, provided that:

    (1) Neither the member of the Board of Governors nor his or her spouse exercises active control over the financial interests held by the fund; and

    (2) The fund does not have a stated policy of concentrating its investments in, as applicable, persons engaged in the delivery outside the mails of mailable matter, except daily newspapers, or persons engaged primarily in the business of leasing real property to the Postal Service.

    (c) —(1)  Any financial interest prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section shall be divested, in the case of a Governor, within 90 calendar days of confirmation by the Senate of the Governor's nomination, and, in the case of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General, within 90 calendar days of his or her appointment, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.

    (2)  If a financial interest described in paragraph (a) of this section becomes prohibited subsequent to the Governor's confirmation or a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General's appointment:

    (i) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) within 30 calendar days of the DAEO informing the member of the Board of Governors that such financial interests have become prohibited; and

    (ii) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of the DAEO informing the member of the Board of Governors that such financial interests have become prohibited, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.

    (3)  (i) If a member of the Board of Governors, or spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors acquires a financial interest prohibited by paragraph (a)(1) of this section without specific intent to acquire it (such as through marriage, inheritance, or gift) subsequent to the Governor's confirmation or the appointment of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General:

    (A) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's DAEO within 30 calendar days of its acquisition; and

    (B) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of its acquisition, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.

    (ii) If an entity whose financial interests are actively controlled by a member of the Board of Governors acquires a financial interest described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section without specific intent to acquire it (such as through a gift) subsequent to a Governor's confirmation or the appointment of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General:

    (A) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's DAEO within 30 calendar days of its acquisition; and

    (B) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of its acquisition, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.

    (4)  Pending any required divestiture of a prohibited financial interest provided for in this paragraph (c), a member of the Board of Governors shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in particular matters involving or affecting the prohibited financial interest. Disqualification is accomplished by not participating in the particular matter.

    (d)  For good cause shown by a member of the Board of Governors, the Postal Service's DAEO may grant a written waiver to the member of the Board of Governors of any prohibited financial interest described in paragraph (a) or (c)(2) or (3) of this section; provided that the DAEO finds that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of the member of the Board of Governors' misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality or objectivity with which the Postal Service's programs are administered. The DAEO may impose appropriate conditions for granting of the waiver, such as requiring the member of the Board of Governors to execute a written statement of disqualification.

    (e)  For purposes of this section, a  is as defined in § 7001.102(d)(3).
