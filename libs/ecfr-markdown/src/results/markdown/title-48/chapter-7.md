#### § 701.303

        (a)  The AIDAR is USAID's Acquisition Regulation supplementing the FAR (48 CFR chapter 1) and is published as chapter 7 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. Changes to the AIDAR shall be published in compliance with FAR part 1.

        (b)  Significant procurement policies and procedures that do not correspond to or conveniently fit into the FAR system described in FAR subpart 1.1 and 1.303 may be published as Appendices to the AIDAR. Appendices follow the main text of the AIDAR in a section entitled “Appendices to Chapter 7” and contain a table of contents and the individual appendices identified by letter and subject title (e.g., “Appendix D—Direct USAID Contracts with a U.S. Citizen or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad”).

        (c)  Only the M/OAA Director has the authority to issue internal Agency guidance applicable to all Agency contracts. The heads of the various Agency contracting activities (see Subparts 701.6 and 702.170) may issue operating instructions and procedures consistent with the FAR, AIDAR, and other Agency regulations, policies, and procedures for application within their organizations. One copy of each such issuance must be forwarded to the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P). Insofar as possible, such material must be numerically keyed to the AIDAR.

      Subpart 701.4—Deviations from the FAR or AIDAR

        701.402   Policy.

#### § 701.402

        It is USAID policy to approve deviations from the mandatory requirements of the FAR and AIDAR only if it is essential to effect necessary procurement actions and when special and exceptional circumstances make such deviation clearly in the best interest of the Government.

> [79 FR 74989, Dec. 16, 2014]

        701.470   Procedure.

#### § 701.470

        (a)  (1) Deviations that affect only one contract or procurement require prior approval by the head of the contracting activity.

        (2) In preparing and submitting deviations for approval, USAID operating units must follow the applicable USAID policies in the ADS 300 series, including mandatory written consultations with the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P) and the Office of the General Counsel. For deviations related to AIDAR appendices D and J, Director of M/OAA clearance is required in lieu of M/OAA/P consultations, as outlined in appendices D and J. The CO must retain all approved deviations in the contract file.

        (b)  Class deviations are those that affect more than one contract or contractor. Deviations involving basic ordering agreements or indefinite-delivery contracts are class deviations as they are considered to involve more than one contract.

        (1) Class deviations from the AIDAR will be processed in the same manner as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2) Class deviations from the FAR will be considered jointly by USAID and the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (C/CAAC) pursuant to FAR 1.404. M/OAA/P is responsible for consultations with the C/CAAC. If the head of the contracting activity determines that urgency precludes such consultations, the deviation must include the reason, certified by the head of the contracting activity, for not coordinating with the C/CAAC and must be promptly shared with M/OAA/P. M/OAA/P is responsible for notifying the C/CAAC of the class deviation.

        (3) Individual heads of contracting activities have authority to approve class deviations affecting contracts only within the contracting activity under their management authority. Only the M/OAA Director has authority to approve class deviations that affect more than one contracting activity.

        (4) Class deviations from the FAR and the AIDAR will expire two (2) years from the date of approval, unless a shorter period is specified in a deviation or approval is rescinded. Class deviations from the FAR or the AIDAR that are based on statutory requirements or those that are in an active agency or Federal rulemaking process may extend beyond the 2-year period until the rulemaking is completed. Expiration of the deviation or the completion of related rulemaking ends its availability for use in future awards and modifications. Expiration dates must be shown on all class deviations.

        (5) Class deviations cannot be extended, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A new deviation to replace an expiring deviation must be prepared and approved in accordance with applicable Agency policy.

        (6) Approved class deviations must be retained by the issuing office and also in each contract file where the deviation is used.

        (c)  All requests for deviations must contain a complete description of the deviation, the effective date of the deviation, the circumstances in which the deviation will be used, a specific reference to the regulation being deviated from, an indication as to whether any identical or similar deviations have been approved in the past, a complete justification of the deviation including any added or decreased cost to the Government, and, as applicable, the name(s) of the contractor(s), and the contract or task order number(s).

        (d)  Once the terms and conditions of an award are approved based on a deviation, they remain in effect unless such authority is limited by the terms of the contract or removed by a modification.

      Subpart 701.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities

        701.601   General.

#### § 701.601

        (a)  (1) Pursuant to the delegations in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 103, the M/OAA Director is authorized to act as the head of the agency for all purposes described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR, 48 CFR chapter 1), except for the authority in FAR 6.302-7, 17.602(a), 19.201(c), 27.306(a), and 30.201-5, or where the “head of the agency” authority is expressly not delegable under the FAR or AIDAR. Further, the M/OAA Director is responsible for implementing the procurement-related aspects of the Foreign Assistance Act, Executive Order 11223, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, and other statutory and Executive Branch procurement policies and requirements applicable to USAID operations, including those authorities and responsibilities delegated to the Senior Procurement Executive as specified in the ADS.

        (2) The M/OAA Director has specific authority to:

        (i) Select and appoint contracting officers and terminate their appointments in accordance with FAR 1.603; and

        (ii) Exercise or delegate the authorities identified in FAR subpart 1.4 with regard to deviations from FAR subpart 1.4.

        (b)  Except as otherwise prescribed, the head of each contracting activity (as defined in 702.170) is responsible for the procurement of supplies and services within the contracting activity under their management authority. The heads of USAID contracting activities are vested with broad authority to carry out the programs and activities for which they are responsible. This includes authority to execute contracts and establish procurement guidance and standards (including delegations, assignments of responsibilities, work-flow procedures, and internal reporting requirements) for their programs and activities, subject to Government-wide and USAID requirements and limitations, such as those found in this section and particularly 701.603-70, the USAID policy regarding the direct-hire status of contracting officers.

        (c)  A contracting activity may establish procurement guidance, standards, strategies, practices, or procedures to implement its programs and activities. Such guidance, standards, strategies, practices, or procedures must be consistent with government-wide or agency-specific regulations and policies, or, if inconsistent, must be processed as a deviation in accordance with 701.470. A contracting activity may also establish procurement guidance, standards, strategies, practices, or procedures for its programs and activities, which are in the best interest of the Government and which are not specifically addressed in the government-wide or agency-specific regulations and policies, nor prohibited by law, Executive order, or other regulation.

        (d)  The authority of heads of contracting activities to execute contracts is limited as follows:

        (1)  (i) Authority to execute and modify contracts for immediate disaster relief purposes, including personal services contracts up to $500,000 per transaction.

        (ii) Authority to execute simplified acquisitions up to $50,000 for immediate disaster relief purposes, or delegate such authority to qualified individuals in BHA. Such individuals must be selected and appointed in accordance with the requirements in FAR 1.603 and AIDAR 701.603.

        (2)  (i) Authority to execute contracts and modifications where the total estimated cost of the contract, including any modifications, does not exceed $1,000,000 (or local currency equivalent) for personal services contracts.

        (ii) Authority to execute simplified acquisitions within the threshold defined in FAR 2.101 (or local currency equivalent).

        (iii) May delegate the authority for simplified acquisitions up to $50,000 to qualified individuals within that contracting activity. Such individuals must be selected and appointed in accordance with the requirements in FAR 1.603 and AIDAR 701.603.

        701.602-1   Authority of contracting officers in resolving audit recommendations.

#### § 701.602-1

        With the exception of termination settlements subject to part 749, contracting officers have the authority to negotiate and enter into settlements with contractors for costs questioned under audit reports, or to issue a contracting officer's final decision pursuant to applicable dispute resolution procedures (in the event that questioned costs are not settled by negotiated agreement) in accordance with USAID's internal policy. The negotiated settlement or final decision will be final, subject only to a contractor's appeal under the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), or other procedures, as applicable. Internal policy and procedures for resolving audit recommendations are found in ADS series 500 chapters for audits.

        701.603-70   Designation of contracting officers.

#### § 701.603-70

        A contracting officer represents the U.S. Government through the exercise of his/her delegated authority to negotiate, sign, and administer contracts on behalf of the U.S. Government. The contracting officer's duties are sensitive, specialized, and responsible. To ensure proper accountability, and to preclude possible security, conflict of interest, or jurisdiction problems, USAID contracting officers must be U.S. citizen direct-hire employees of the U.S. Government. However, Director, Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance (M/OAA Director) may also designate a U.S. Personal Services Contractor (USPSC) or a Cooperating Country National Personal Services Contractor (CCNPSC) as a contracting officer with a specific level of warrant authority. To qualify for a designation as a contracting officer, an individual must meet the requirements in FAR subpart 1.6 and the Agency's applicable warrant program.

#### § 704.7003

        In the interest of national security, USAID may determine that a particular acquisition is subject to vetting. In that case, USAID will require vetting of all key individuals of offerors, first tier subcontractors, and any other class of subcontracts if identified in the solicitation and resulting contract. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award a contract to any offeror who does not pass vetting.

        704.7004   Procedures.

#### § 704.7004

        704.7004-1   Preaward requirements.

#### § 704.7004-1

        (a) When USAID determines an acquisition to be subject to vetting, the contracting officer determines the appropriate stage of the acquisition cycle to require offerors to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in the solicitation. The contracting officer must specify in the solicitation the stage at which the offerors will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form.

        (b) For negotiated procurements using (48 CFR) FAR part 15, this stage will typically be when the contracting officer establishes the competitive range (48 CFR 15.306(c)). However, the contracting officer may determine that vetting is more appropriate at a different stage of the source selection process, such as immediately prior to award, and then require only the apparently successful offeror to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form.

        (c) For Indefinite Delivery contracts under (48 CFR) FAR subpart 16.5, vetting will occur prior to award of the basic contract if the contracting officer anticipates placing orders subject to vetting under that contract. Vetting will also occur before USAID places any orders subject to vetting. The contracting officer will notify awardees of the appropriate timing for vetting in the request for task or delivery order proposals. See (48 CFR) AIDAR subpart 716.5 for vetting procedures for task and delivery orders.

        (d) For all other acquisitions, including those under (48 CFR) FAR parts 13 and 14, the contracting officer determines the appropriate time to require potential awardee(s) to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official.

        (e) Source selection proceeds separately from vetting. The source selection authority makes the source selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that the apparently successful offeror has passed or not passed vetting.

        (f) The contracting officer may only award to an offeror who has passed vetting.

        704.7004-2   Post award requirements.

#### § 704.7004-2

        (a) For those contracts and task orders the Agency has determined are subject to vetting, the contractor must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:

        (1) Key individuals, and

        (2) Subcontractors for which vetting is required.

        (b) USAID may vet key individuals of the contractor and any required subcontractors periodically during contract performance using the information already submitted on the Form.

> [77 FR 8170, Feb. 14, 2012, as amended at 79 FR 74992 Dec. 16, 2014]

        704.7004-3   Subcontracts.

#### § 704.7004-3

        (a) When the prime contract is subject to vetting, vetting is required for key individuals of all subcontracts under that contract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts.

        (b) The contracting officer must not consent to a subcontract with any subcontractor subject to vetting until that subcontractor has passed vetting.

        (c) Vetting may be required for key individuals of subcontracts at any tier for certain classes of items (supplies and services). The contracting officer must identify these classes of items in the solicitation.

        (d) The contractor may instruct prospective subcontractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the contractor submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.

> [77 FR 8170, Feb. 14, 2012, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014]

        704.7005   Solicitation provision and contract clause.

#### § 704.7005

        (a) The contracting officer will insert the provision at 752.204-70 Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements, in all solicitations USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

        (b) Except for awards made under FAR part 16, the contracting officer will—

        (1) Insert the clause at 752.204-71 Partner Vetting, in all solicitations and contracts USAID identifies as subject to vetting, or

        (2) Use the clause with its Alternate I when USAID determines that subcontracts at any tier for certain classes of supplies or services are subject to vetting.

        (c) For awards made under FAR part 16, see (48 CFR) AIDAR subpart 716.5.

        (3)(i) Supplies or services when the cognizant Assistant Administrator makes a formal written Determination and Findings (D&F)(see FAR subpart 1.7), that compliance with full and open competition procedures to procure the goods or services through one or more contract actions would impair foreign assistance objectives and would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of one or more foreign assistance programs for which the Assistant Administrator is responsible; or

        (ii) Supplies or services for countries, regions, or programs for which the Administrator of USAID makes a D&F (see FAR subpart 1.7) that compliance with full and open competition procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of foreign assistance programs;

        (4) Supplies or services awarded under 715.370-1 or 715.370-2; and

        (5) A specific contract for the continued provision of highly-specialized services when an award to another contractor would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or cause unacceptable delays.

      711.002-70   Metric system waivers.

#### § 711.002-70

      (a)  The (48 CFR) FAR 11.002(b) requirement to use the metric system of measurement for specifications and quantitative data that are incorporated in or required by USAID contracts may be waived when USAID determines in writing that such usage is impractical or is likely to cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets.

      (b)  (1) The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in ADS Chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric requirement for one of the above reasons. The USAID Metric Executive is authorized to overrule a decision to grant a waiver, or to nullify a blanket waiver made by another approving official so long as a contractor's rights under an executed contract are not infringed upon.

      (2) A blanket waiver for a class of multiple transactions may be issued for a term not to exceed three years.

      (3) When a waiver will be based upon the adverse impact on U.S. firms, clearance from the USAID Metric Executive and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will be obtained prior to authorization.

      (c)  (1) The basis for each waiver and any plans to adapt similar requirements to metric specifications in future procurements should be documented in the contract file.

      (2) Each procurement activity will maintain a log of the waivers from the metric requirements which are authorized for its procurements. The logs shall list the commodity/service being procured, total dollar value of the procured item(s), waiver date, authorizing official, basis for waiver, and USAID actions that can promote metrication and lessen the need for future waivers.

      (3) Within 30 days of the closing of each fiscal year, each USAID/W procurement activity and each Mission will submit a copy of the metric waiver log for the year to the USAID Metric Executive. (Mission logs are to be consolidated in a Mission report for the procurement activity and for the nonprocurement activities maintaining such logs under the USAID Metric Transition Plan.) Repetitive purchases of commercially produced and marketed items and classes of items may be consolidated in reporting procurements that do not exceed $10,000 cumulatively during the reporting period.

        The following selection procedures may be used, when appropriate, for activities covered under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

> [64 FR 16649, Apr. 6, 1999]

        715.370-1   Title XII selection procedure—general.

#### § 715.370-1

        (a)  The Deputy Administrator has determined, as provided in (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(3)(ii) that use of this Title XII source selection procedure is necessary so as not to impair or affect USAID's ability to administer Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act. This determination is reflected in (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4). This constitutes authority for other than full and open competition when selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII projects.

        (b)  This subsection prescribes policies and procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities authorized under Title XII.

        (c)  The provisions of this subsection are applicable when the project office certifies that the activity is authorized under Title XII, and determines that use of the Title XII selection procedure is appropriate.

        (d)  (1) Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this subsection.

        (2) The project office shall—

        (i) Prepare selection criteria for evaluation of eligible institutions for use in preparing the source list, determining predominantly qualified sources, and selecting the contractor;

        (ii) Prepare an initial list of eligible institutions considered qualified to perform the proposed activity;

        (iii) Provide a statement describing qualifications and areas of expertise considered essential, a statement of work, estimate of personnel requirements, special requirements (logistic support, Government furnished property, and so forth) for the contracting officer's use in preparing the request for technical proposal (RFTP).

        (iv) Send a memorandum incorporating the certification and determination required by paragraph (c) of this section, together with the information required by paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, with the “Action” copy of the requisition to the contracting officer, requesting him/her to prepare and distribute the RFTP.

        (3) Upon receipt and acceptance of the project officer's request, the contracting officer shall prepare the RFTP. The RFTP shall contain sufficient information to enable an offeror to submit a responsive and complete technical proposal. This includes a definitive statement of work, an estimate of the personnel required, and special provisions (such as logistic support, Government furnished equipment, and so forth), a proposed contract format, and evaluation criteria. No cost or pricing data will be requested or required by the RFTP. The RFTP will be distributed to the eligible institutions recommended by the project office. The RFTP will be synopsized, as required by (48 CFR) FAR 5.201, and will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation and submission of a proposal.

        (4) Upon receipt of responses to the RFTP by the contracting officer, an evaluation committee will be established as provided for in 715.303-70.

        (5) The evaluation committee will evaluate all proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFTP, and will prepare a selection memorandum which shall:

        (i) State the evaluation criteria;

        (ii) List all of the eligible institutions whose proposals were reviewed;

        (iii) Report on the ranking and rationale therefor for all proposals;

        (iv) Indicate the eligible institution or institutions considered best qualified.

        (6) The evaluation committee will submit the selection memorandum to the contracting officer for review and approval.

        (7) The contracting officer will either approve the selection memorandum, or return it to the evaluation committee for reconsideration for specified reasons.

        (8) If the selection memorandum is approved, the contracting officer shall obtain cost, pricing, and other necessary data from the recommended institution or institutions and shall conduct negotiations. If a satisfactory contract cannot be obtained, the contracting officer will so advise the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee may then recommend an alternate institution or institutions.

        715.370-2   Title XII selection procedure—collaborative assistance.

#### § 715.370-2

        (a)  (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4) provides authority for other than full and open competition when selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII activities.

        (b)  This subsection prescribes policies and procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities authorized under Title XII, where USAID has determined, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection, that use of the collaborative assistance contracting system is appropriate. See (48 CFR) AIDAR appendix F (of this chapter)—Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for Title XII Activities for a more complete definition and discussion of the collaborative assistance method.

        (c)  The following findings and determinations must be made prior to initiating any contract actions under the collaborative assistance method:

        (1) The cognizant technical office makes a preliminary finding that an activity:

        (i) Is authorized by Title XII; and

        (ii) Should be classed as collaborative assistance because a continuing collaborative relationship between USAID, the host country, and the contractor is required from design through completion of the activity, and USAID, host country, and contractor participation in a continuing review and evaluation of the activity is essential for its proper execution.

        (2) Based upon this preliminary finding, the cognizant technical office shall establish an evaluation panel consisting of a representative of the cognizant technical office as chairman, a representative of the contracting officer, and any other representatives considered appropriate by the chairman to review the proposed activity for its appropriateness under the collaborative assistance method.

        (3) If supported by the panel's findings, the chairman will make a formal written determination that the collaborative assistance method is the appropriate contracting method for the Title XII activity in question.

        (d)  (1) Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this section.

        (2) The evaluation panel shall:

        (i) Prepare evaluation and selection criteria;

        (ii) Prepare an initial source list of eligible institutions considered qualified to perform the proposed project; and

        (iii) Evaluate the list, using the evaluation criteria previously determined, for the purpose of making a written determination of the sources considered most capable of performing the project.

        (3) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a memorandum requesting the contracting officer to prepare a request for expressions of interest from qualified sources and setting forth:

        (i) The formal determinations required by paragraph (c) of this section;

        (ii) The evaluation criteria which have been determined; and

        (iii) The recommended source list and the rationale therefor.

        (4) The contracting officer will prepare a request for an expression of interest (REI), containing sufficient information to permit an offeror to determine its interest in the project, and to discuss the project with USAID representatives, if appropriate. The REI should include a concise statement of the purpose of the activity, any special conditions or qualifications considered important, a brief description of the selection procedure and evaluation criteria which will be used, the proposed contract format, and any other information considered appropriate. The REI will be issued to the sources recommended by the panel, and to others, as appropriate; it will be synopsized, as required by (48 CFR) FAR 5.201, and it will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation of an expression of interest. Guidelines for preparation of expressions of interest are contained in attachment 1 to (48 CFR) AIDAR appendix F.

        (5) The contracting officer will transmit all expressions of interest to the evaluation panel for evaluation and selection recommendation. The panel may conduct on site evaluations at its discretion, as part of the evaluation process.

        (6) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a written selection recommendation with supporting justification, recommending that negotiations be conducted with the prospective contractor(s) selected by the evaluation panel. The selection recommendation shall be transmitted to the contracting officer together with the complete official file on the project which was being maintained by the evaluation panel.

        (7) The contracting officer will review the selection recommendation, obtain necessary cost and other data, and proceed to negotiate with the recommended sources.

      Subpart 715.6—Unsolicited Proposals

        715.602   Policy.

#### § 715.602

        (a) USAID encourages the submission of unsolicited proposals that contribute new and innovative ideas that are consistent with and contribute to the accomplishment of the Agency's objectives. Potential offerors should consider the guidance in FAR 15.6 and in AIDAR 715.6 prior to preparing and submitting a formal unsolicited proposal.

        (b) Unsolicited proposals will only be considered when they support USAID strategy. USAID Mission programs must be responsive to the needs of the cooperating country; projects are often designed in collaboration with the cooperating country. These factors can limit both the need for, and USAID's ability to use, unsolicited proposals.

        (c) The  website contains information on working with USAID and on individual Mission and Agency-wide strategies and objectives. Prospective offerors are also encouraged to review USAID's Business Forecast web page and consider responding to USAID competitive announcements published on  and .

      Subpart 719.2—Policies

        719.270   Small business policies.

#### § 719.270

        (a) In keeping with section 602 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2352), as amended, USAID shall, insofar as practicable and to the maximum extent consistent with the accomplishment of the purposes of said Act, assist U.S. small businesses to participate equitably in the furnishing of supplies and services for Foreign Assistance activities.

        (b) It is the policy of USAID to:

        (1) Fully endorse and carry out the Government's small business program for placing a fair proportion of its purchases and contracts for supplies, construction (including maintenance and repair), research and development, and services (including personal, professional, and technical services) with small business, including minority small business concerns; and

        (2) Increase their participation in USAID procurement.

        (c) In furtherance of this policy:

        (1) Contracting officer's representatives shall make positive efforts (see 719.271-5) to identify potentially qualified small and minority business firms during precontract development of activities and shall, with the responsible contracting officers, assure that such firms are given full opportunity to participate equitably;

        (2) Small business set-asides shall be made for all contracts to be executed in USAID/Washington which qualify for small business set-aside action under part 19 of the (48 CFR) FAR; and

        (3) Consideration shall be given in appropriate cases to the award of the contract to the Small Business Administration for subcontracting to small business firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).

        (d) This program shall be implemented by all USAID/Washington contracting activities in order to attain these policy objectives. In accordance with 719.271, all USAID/Washington direct-procurement requirements which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold shall be screened for small business opportunities by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) except those exempted by 719.271-6(a).

        (e) Where practicable and desirable, small business and minority business enterprise award goals will be established for the respective USAID/Washington procuring activities to provide incentive for contracting personnel to increase awards to small firms. The goals will be set by OSDBU after consultation with the respective head of the contracting activity (see 702-170).

        (f) In the event of a disagreement between OSDBU and the contracting officer concerning: (1) A recommended set-aside, or (2) a request for modification or withdrawal of a class or individual set-aside, complete documentation of the case including the reasons for disagreement shall be transmitted within five working days to the head of the contracting activity (see 719.271-6(e)) for a decision. Procurement action shall be suspended pending a decision.

        (g) The above suspension shall not apply where the contracting officer:

        (1) Certifies in writing, with supporting information, that in order to protect the public interest award must be made without delay;

        (2) Promptly provides a copy of said certification to OSDBU; and

        (3) Includes a copy of the certification in the contract file.

        (h) OSDBU shall be the Small Business Advisor and Minority Business Procurement Policy Manager for all USAID/Washington procuring activities.

        (i) The details on the Agency's direction and operation of the small business program are set forth in 719.271.

        (j) No decision rendered, or action taken, under the coverage set forth in 719.271 shall preclude the Small Business Administration from appealing directly to the USAID Administrator as provided for in part 19 of the FAR.

        (i) Locate capable small business sources for current and future procurements through GSA and other methods;

        (ii) Utilize every source available to determine if an item is obtainable from small business; and

        (iii) Develop adequate small business competition on all appropriate procurements;

        (10) Taking action to assure that unnecessary qualifications, restrictive specifications, or other features (such as inadequate procurement lead time) of the programming or procurement process, which may prevent small business participation in the competitive process, are modified to permit such participation where an adequate product or service can be obtained;

        (11) Recommending that portions of large planned procurements or suitable components of end items or services be purchased separately so small firms may compete;

        (12) On proposed non-competitive procurements, recommending to the contracting officer that the procurement be made competitive when, in the opinion of OSDBU, there are small business or minority business enterprises believed competent to furnish the required goods or services, and supplying the contracting officer a list of such firms;

        (a) Consult with OSDBU on the availability and capabilities of small business firms to permit making a tentative set-aside determination where appropriate; and

        (b) Provide sufficient procurement lead time in the activity implementation schedule to allow potential small business participation.

#### § 719.272

      Subpart 719.273—The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mentor-Protégé Program

**Source:** Source: 72 FR 32543, June 13, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

        719.273   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mentor-Protégé Program.

#### § 719.273

        719.273-1   Purpose.

#### § 719.273-1

        The USAID Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to assist small business, including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business in enhancing their capabilities to perform contracts and sub-contracts for USAID and other Federal agencies. The Mentor-Protégé Program is also designed to improve the performance of USAID contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to Protégé entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between small business and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of small business that receive USAID contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a Protégé under a USAID contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.

        719.273-2   Definitions.

#### § 719.273-2

        Throughout, the term “small business” includes all categories of small firms as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) on whose behalf the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) is chartered to advocate, including small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small business and small business located in HUBZones, as those terms are defined in 13 CFR part 124. The determination of affiliation is a function of the SBA.

        (a) A “Mentor” is a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the Protégé.

        (b) “Program” refers to the USAID Mentor-Protégé Program as described in this Chapter.

        (c) “Protégé” means a small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran owned small business that is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a Mentor-Protégé Agreement.

        719.273-3   Incentives for prime contractor participation.

#### § 719.273-3

        (a) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), USAID is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated procurements. (48 CFR) FAR 19.202-1 provides additional guidance.

        (b) Costs incurred by a Mentor to provide developmental assistance, as described in 719.273-8 to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s) with a Protégé firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a USAID contract. If USAID is the mentor's responsible audit agency under (48 CFR) FAR 42.703-1, USAID will consider these costs in determining indirect cost rates. If USAID is not the responsible audit agency, mentors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates.

        (c) In addition to subparagraph (b) above, contracting officers may give Mentors evaluation credit under (48 CFR) FAR 15.101-1 considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protégé Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:

        (1) Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans containing Mentor-Protégé arrangements more favorably than subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protégé Agreements.

        (2) Contracting officers may assess the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in evaluating past performance under (48 CFR) FAR 15.305(a)(2)(v) and determining contractor responsibility (48 CFR) 19.705-5(a)(1).

        (d) OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented annually to the Mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a Protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).

        (e) OSDBU Mentor-Protégé Annual Conference. At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, Mentor firms will be invited to brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other guests on Program progress.

        719.273-4   Eligibility of Mentor and Protégé firms.

#### § 719.273-4

        Eligible business entities approved as Mentors may enter into agreements (hereafter referred to as “Mentor-Protégé Agreement” or “Agreement” and explained in section 719.273-6) with eligible Protégés. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of Protégés to perform as contractors and/or subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing developmental assistance may be approved as Mentors. Protégés may participate in the Program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the Mentor's prime contract with the USAID, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a USAID prime contractor or be a USAID prime contractor. Notwithstanding eligibility requirements in this section, USAID reserves the right to limit the number of participants in the Program in order to insure its effective management of the Mentor-Protégé Program.

        (a)  A Mentor:

        (1) May be either a large or small business entity;

        (2) Must be eligible for award of Government contracts;

        (3) Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of Protégés to perform as prime contractors or subcontractors; and

        (4) Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with entities with which it has established business relationships.

        (b)  A Protégé:

        (1) Must be a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business);

        (2) Must meet the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code that the Mentor prime contractor believes best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract; and

        (3) Eligible for award of Government contracts.

        (c) Protégés may have multiple Mentors. Protégés participating in Mentor-Protégé programs in addition to USAID's Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of Mentoring activity so that results of the USAID Program can be reported separately from any other agency program.

        (d) A Protégé firm shall self-certify to a Mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and possess related certifications granted by the Small Business Administration (e.g., HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential Protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. HUBZone and small disadvantaged business status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined according to 13 CFR part 124.

> [49 FR 13243, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014]

        719.273-5   Selection of Protégé firms.

#### § 719.273-5

        (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting Protégé firms. Mentors are encouraged to select from a broad base of small business including small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and HUBZone firms whose core competencies support USAID's mission.

        (b) Mentors may have multiple Protégés. However, to preserve the integrity of the Program and assure the quality of developmental assistance provided to Protégés, USAID reserves the right to limit the total number of Protégés participating under each Mentor firm for the Mentor-Protégé Program.

        (c) The selection of Protégé firms by Mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a Mentor shall be handled in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Small Business Administration regulations.

        719.273-6   Application process.

#### § 719.273-6

        Entities interested in becoming a Mentor firm must apply in writing to the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) by submitting form AID 321-1 (OMB Control number 0412-0574 approved on 5/22/2007). The application shall contain the Mentor-Protégé Agreement and shall be evaluated for approval. Evaluations will consider the nature and extent of technical and managerial support as well as any proposed financial assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture, and traditional subcontracting support. The Mentor-Protégé Agreement must contain:

        (a) Names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses (if available) of Mentor and Protégé firm(s) and a point of contact for both Mentor and Protégé;

        (b) A description of the developmental assistance that will be provided by the Mentor to the Protégé, including a description of the work or product contracted for (if any), a schedule for providing assistance, and criteria for evaluation of the Protégé's developmental success;

        (c) A listing of the number and types of subcontracts to be awarded to the Protégé;

        (d) Duration of the Agreement, including rights and responsibilities of both parties (Mentor and Protégé);

        (e) Termination procedures, including procedures for the parties' voluntary withdrawal from the Program. The Agreement shall require the Mentor or the Protégé to notify the other firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of its intent to voluntarily terminate the Agreement;

        (f) Procedures requiring the parties to notify OSDBU immediately upon receipt of termination notice from the other party;

        (g) A plan for accomplishing the work or product contracted for should the Agreement be terminated; and

        (h) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.

        719.273-7   OSDBU review of application.

#### § 719.273-7

        (a) OSDBU will review the information to establish the Mentor and Protégé eligibility and to ensure that the information that is in section 719.273-6 is included. If the application relates to a specific contract, then OSDBU will consult with the responsible contracting officer on the adequacy of the proposed Agreement, as appropriate. OSDBU will complete its review no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the application or after consultation with the contracting officer, whichever is later. Application for and enrollment into the Program are free and open to the public.

        (b) After OSDBU completes its review and provides written approval, the Mentor may execute the Agreement and implement the developmental assistance as provided under the Agreement. OSDBU will provide a copy of the Mentor-Protégé Agreement to the USAID contracting officer for any USAID contracts affected by the Agreement.

        (c) The Agreement defines the relationship between the Mentor and Protégé firms only. The Agreement itself does not create any privity of contract or contractual relationship between the Mentor and USAID nor the Protégé and USAID.

        (d) If the application is disapproved, the Mentor may provide additional information for reconsideration. OSDBU will complete review of any supplemental material no later than 30 days after its receipt. Upon finding deficiencies that USAID considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the Mentor and Protégé and request correction of deficiencies to be provided within 15 days.

        719.273-8   Developmental assistance.

#### § 719.273-8

        The forms of developmental assistance a Mentor can provide to a Protégé include and are not limited to the following:

        (a) Guidance relating to—

        (1) Financial management;

        (2) Organizational management;

        (3) Overall business management/planning;

        (4) Business development; and

        (5) Technical assistance.

        (b) Loans;

        (c) Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;

        (d) Property;

        (e) Temporary assignment of personnel to a Protégé for training; and

        (f) Any other types of permissible, mutually beneficial assistance.

        719.273-9   Obligations under the Mentor-Protégé Program.

#### § 719.273-9

        (a) A Mentor or Protégé may voluntarily withdraw from the Program. However, in no event shall such withdrawal impact the contractual requirements under any prime contract.

        (b) Mentor and Protégé entities shall submit to the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) annual reports on progress under the Mentor-Protégé Agreement. USAID will evaluate annual reports by considering the following:

        (1) Specific actions taken by the Mentor during the evaluation period to increase the participation of their Protégé(s) as suppliers to the Federal Government and to commercial entities;

        (2) Specific actions taken by the Mentor during the evaluation period to develop technical and administrative expertise of a Protégé as defined in the Agreement;

        (3) The extent to which the Protégé has met the developmental objectives in the Agreement;

        (4) The extent to which the Mentor's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program impacted the Protégé'(s) ability to receive contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and Federal agencies other than USAID; and, if deemed necessary;

        (5) Input from the Protégé on the nature of the developmental assistance provided by the Mentor.

        (c) OSDBU will submit annual reports to the relevant contracting officer regarding participating prime contractor(s)' performance in the Program.

        (d) Mentor and Protégé firms shall submit an evaluation to OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon Program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the Program, whichever comes first.

        719.273-10   Internal controls.

#### § 719.273-10

        (a) OSDBU will oversee the Program and will work in concert with the Mentor-Protégé Program Manager and relevant contracting officers to achieve Program objectives. OSDBU will establish internal controls as checks and balances applicable to the Program. These controls will include:

        (1) Reviewing and evaluating Mentor applications for validity of the provided information;

        (2) Reviewing annual progress reports submitted by Mentors and Protégés on Protégé development to measure Protégé progress against the plan submitted in the approved Agreement;

        (3) Reviewing and evaluating financial reports and invoices submitted by the Mentor to verify that USAID is not charged by the Mentor for providing developmental assistance to the Protégé; and

        (4) Limiting the number of participants in the Mentor-Protégé Program within a reporting period, in order to insure the effective management of the Program.

        (b) USAID may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé Agreement if it determines that such action is in USAID's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the Mentor and Protégé after approval by the Director of OSDBU. Rescission of an Agreement does not change the terms of any subcontract between the Mentor and the Protégé.

        719.273-11   Solicitation provision and contract clause.

#### § 719.273-11

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.219-70 in all unrestricted solicitations exceeding $550,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) that offer subcontracting opportunities.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.219-71 in all contracts where the prime contractor has signed a Mentor-Protégé Agreement with USAID.

#### § 722.103-2

        (a) Most contracts covered by this regulation call for the performance of professional or technical services overseas on a cost-reimbursement basis. The compensation for employees performing such services is normally fixed on a monthly or annual basis, and the contracts usually state minimum work week hours. It is not expected that these employees will receive additional pay, overtime or shift premiums, or compensatory time off.

        (b) When the contracting officer determines it is in the best interests of the Government, specific provision may be made in contracts to permit such benefits for non-technical and non-professional employees serving overseas, subject to approvals to be required in the contract.

        722.170   Employment of third country nationals (TCN's) and cooperating country nationals (CCN's).

#### § 722.170

        (a)  It is USAID policy that cooperating country nationals (CCNs) and third country nationals (TCNs), who are hired abroad for work in a cooperating country under USAID-direct contracts, generally be extended the same benefits, and be subject to the same restrictions as TCNs and CCNs employed by the USAID Mission. Exceptions to this policy may be granted either by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (TCN's and CCN's who are hired to work in the United States shall be extended benefits and subject to restrictions on the same basis as U.S. citizens who work in the United States.)

        (b)  Compensation, including merit or promotion increases paid to TCN's and CCN's may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country as determined by the USAID Mission. Unless otherwise authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, the compensation of such TCN and CCN employees shall be paid in the currency of the cooperating country.

        (c)  TCN's and CCN's, hired abroad for work in a cooperating country, are not eligible for allowances or differentials under USAID-direct contracts, unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project.

        (d)  The contractor shall insure that the necessary clearances, including security clearances, if required, have been obtained for TCN and CCN employees in accordance with any such requirements set forth in the contract or required by the USAID Mission, prior to the TCN or CCN starting work under the contract.

        (e)  Contractors are required to insure that prospective TCN and CCN employees are examined prior to employment to determine whether the prospective employee meets the minimum physical requirements of the position and is free from any contagious disease.

        (f)  The workweek, holidays, and leave for TCN and CCN employees shall be the same as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract; however, TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for home leave or military leave unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project.

      Subpart 722.8—Equal Employment Opportunity

        722.805-70   Procedures.

#### § 722.805-70

        (a) The procedures in this section apply, as appropriate, for all contracts excluding construction, which shall be handled in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 22.804-1. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements of (48 CFR) FAR 22.8 and related clauses are met before awarding any contracts or consenting to subcontracts subject to these requirements.

        (b)  The first step in ensuring compliance with these requirements is to obtain all necessary representations and certifications (Reps and Certs) as required by (48 CFR) FAR 22.810 and FAR 4.1202. When applicable, the contracting officer must review the Reps and Certs to determine whether they have been completed and signed as required, and are acceptable.

        (c)  If the Reps and Certs are complete, signed, and deemed acceptable, and the contracting officer has no reason to doubt their accuracy, the contracting officer must then consult the OFCCP's National Preaward Registry at the internet website in 48 CFR 22.805(a)(4) (i) to see if the offeror is listed.

        (1) If the conditions stated in (48 CFR) FAR 22.805(a) (4) are met (including the contract file documentation requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)), then the contracting officer does not need to take any further action in verifying the offeror's compliance with the requirements of this subpart and (48 CFR) FAR 22.8.

        (2) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward Registry, and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is expected to be under $10 million then the contracting officer may rely on the Reps and Certs as sufficient verification of the offeror's compliance.

        (3) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward Registry and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is $10 million or more, then the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the appropriate OFCCP regional office, in accordance with 48 CFR 22.805(a). If the initial contact with OFCCP is by telephone, the contracting officer and OFCCP are to mutually determine what information is to be included in the written verification request. The contracting officer may need to provide the following information in addition to the items listed in (48 CFR) FAR 22.805(a)(5), if so requested by the OFCCP regional office:

        (i) Name, title, address, and telephone number of a contract person for the prospective contractor;

        (ii) A description of the type of organization (university, nonprofit, etc.) and its ownership (private, foreign, state, etc.).

        (iii) Names and addresses of the organizations in a joint venture (if any).

        (iv) Type of procurement (new contract—RFP or IFB, amendment, etc.) and the period of the contract.

        (v) Copy of approved Reps and Certs.

        (d) In the event that OFCCP reports that the offeror is not in compliance, negotiations with the offeror shall be terminated.

        (e)  Every contract file must contain completed and signed Reps and Certs. The file must clearly show that these documents have been reviewed and accepted by the contracting officer. If the Reps and Certs were revised to make them acceptable (see paragraph (b) of this section), the file must also document what changes were required and why, and verify that the changes were made. The contracting officer shall also document the OFCCP National Preaward Registry review (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), and, if the Registry does not include the offeror:

        (1) For contracts or modifications over $10,000 but less than $10 million, the file must contain a statement from the contracting officer that the contractor is considered in compliance with EEO requirements, and giving the basis for this statement (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section). This statement may be in a separate memorandum to the file or in the memorandum of negotiation.

        (2) For contracts or modifications of $10 million or more, the file must document all communications with OFCCP regarding the offeror's compliance. Such documentation includes copies of any written correspondence and a record of telephone conversations, specifying the name, address, and telephone number of the person contacted, a summary of the information presented, and any advice given by OFCCP.

        (f)  In the event OFCCP determines that a prospective contractor is not in compliance, a copy of OFCCP's written determination, and a summary of resultant action taken (termination of negotiations, notification of offeror and contracting officer's representative, negotiation with next offeror in competitive range, resolicitation, etc.) will be placed in the contract file for any contract which may result, together with other records related to unsuccessful offers, and retained for at least six months following award.

        (a)  USAID policy and required procedures in ADS Chapter 225 (Program Principles for Trade and Investment Activities and the “Impact on U.S. Jobs” and “Workers' Rights”) implement statutory prohibitions on obligation and expenditure of appropriated funds. ADS Chapter 225 requires Agency operating units to analyze a project or activity to ensure compliance with U.S. foreign policy objectives as stated in Section 601 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as amended; the U.S. Government's trade and development objectives set forth in trade legislation; and related policy documents. If the analysis concludes that the project or activity meets the criteria for what the ADS chapter describes as “gray-area activities” or if the contract statement of work has the potential to evolve into what the chapter defines as a prohibited activity, then the planner must include in the procurement request language appropriately tailored to the specific circumstances for the contract statement of work.

        (b)  The contracting officer must insert in Section H of the uniform contract format a clause substantially the same as the clause in 752.226-70 when informed by the requesting operating unit that the statement of work or statement of objectives includes gray-area activities or investment-related activities where specific activities are not identified at the time of obligation but could be for investment-related activities, as described in ADS Chapter 225.

#### § 727.7001

        As used in this subpart—

        means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term includes technical data and computer software. The term does not include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.

        is a collection of data elements or data sets that may be grouped together.

        is the first component of a Data Management Plan (DMP). The data inventory is a list of high-value data assets that the contractor anticipates producing during the period of award performance.

        is a tool that guides the identification of anticipated data assets and outlines tasks needed to manage these assets across a full data lifecycle.

        is an organized collection of structured data, including data contained in spreadsheets, whether presented in tabular or non-tabular form. For example, a data set may represent a single spreadsheet, an extensible mark-up language (XML) file, a geospatial data file, or an organized collection of these. A data set does not include unstructured data, such as email or instant messages, PDF files, PowerPoint presentations, word processing documents, images, audio files, or collaboration software.

        means the coding scheme generally used in computer technology to represent data.

        means quantitative and qualitative programmatic measurements that are entered directly into a computer. Examples include numeric targets established during activity design or implementation; baseline, mid-line, or final measurements created or obtained via field assessments; surveys or interviews; performance monitoring indicators as specified in the Contractor's approved Activity Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (AMELP) (see 752.242-71); evaluation results; or perception metrics collected from beneficiaries on the quality and relevance of International Disaster Assistance and Development Assistance.

        is a subset of data and means:

        (1) Digital text;

        (2) Digital data;

        (3) Digital objects; and

        (4) Metadata created or obtained with USAID funding supported by this award that are represented, stored, or transmitted in such a way that they are available to a computer program.

        is a means of using computer technology to gather, process, analyze, transmit, store, or otherwise use data and other forms of information.

        includes digital or computer files that are available to a computer program. Examples include digital word processing or PDF documents or forms related to activity design, assessment reports, periodic progress and performance reports, academic research documents, publication manuscripts, evaluations, technical documentation and reports, and other reports, articles and papers prepared by the contractor, whether published or not. Other examples include data sets, spreadsheets, presentations, publication-quality images, audio and video files, communication materials, information products, extensible mark-up language (XML) files, and software, scripts, source code, and algorithms that can be processed by a computer program.

        includes text-based descriptions of programmatic efforts that are entered directly into a computer, rather than submitted as a digital object.

        727.7002   Policy.

#### § 727.7002

        (a) It is the policy of USAID to manage data as a strategic asset to inform the planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Agency's foreign assistance programs. To achieve this, it is also USAID's policy to manage data and digital information across a full life cycle. This life cycle includes the following stages: Govern, Plan, Acquire, Process, Analyze, Curate, and Publish/Share. For more information about the USAID Development Data policy, see ADS Chapter 579 at  For more information about USAID's Program Cycle policy, see ADS Chapter 201 at

        (b) In furtherance of this policy, USAID requires that contractors:

        (1) Engage in digital information planning, including creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) to identify and plan for the management of data assets that will be produced, furnished, acquired, or collected in a USAID-funded activity.

        (2) Use only digital methods and USAID-approved standards, to the extent practicable, to produce, furnish, acquire, or collect information necessary to implement the contract requirements.

        (3) Provide documentation of informed consent the contractor receives when obtaining information on individuals.

        (4) Submit to USAID digital information produced, furnished, acquired, or collected in performance of a USAID contract at the finest level of granularity employed during contract implementation.

        (c) As specified in ADS Chapter 579, USAID implements appropriate controls to restrict data access in a way that balances the potential benefits with any underlying risks to its beneficiaries and contractors.

        727.7003   Contract clause.

#### § 727.7003

        (a) Insert the clause 752.227-71 in Section H of solicitations and contracts fully or partially funded with program funds exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer may insert this clause in other USAID contracts if the contracting officer, in consultation with the requiring office, determines that doing so is in the best interest of the Agency.

        (b) Insert the clause at 752.227-71, with its Alternate I when the anticipated contract:

        (1) Does not collect data;

        (2) Implements emergency food assistance under the Food for Peace Act or section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including for the procurement, transportation, storage, handling and/or distribution of such assistance;

        (3) Implements international disaster assistance under section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or other authorities administered by the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance; or

        (a) Generally, advance payment bonds will not be required in connection with USAID contracts containing an advance payment provision. In lieu thereof, contracting officers will follow procedures set forth in (48 CFR) FAR 32.409-3.

        (b) Whenever a contracting officer considers that an advance payment bond is necessary, the contracting officer will:

        (1) Establish a bond penalty that will adequately protect interests of the Government;

        (2) Use the USAID Advance Payment Bond format;

        (3) Place bond with a surety currently approved by the U.S. Treasury Department according to the latest Treasury Department Circular 570; and

        (4) Stipulate that the cost of the bond shall not exceed a rate of $7.50 per $1,000 per annum based on the penalty of the bond, without the prior written approval of the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P).

        (c) Where the surety's obligation under an advance payment bond covers all advances made to the contractor during the term of the contract, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances made and to be made under the contract have been fully liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the contract, such as no-pay vouchers, reports of expenditures, or by refund. Where the surety's obligation under the bond is limited to advances made during a specified period of time, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances made and to be made during the specified period have been liquidated as aforesaid.

      Subpart 728.3—Insurance

        728.305-70   Overseas worker's compensation and war-hazard insurance—waivers and USAID insurance coverage.

#### § 728.305-70

        (a) Upon the recommendation of the USAID Administrator, the Secretary of Labor may waive the applicability of the Defense Base Act (DBA) with respect to any contract, subcontract, or subordinate contract, work location, or classification of employees. Either the contractor or USAID can request a waiver from coverage. Such a waiver can apply to any employees who are not U.S. citizens, not residents of, or not hired in the United States. Waivers requested by the contractor are submitted to the contracting officer for approval and further submission to the Department of Labor, which grants the waiver. Application for a waiver is submitted on Labor Department Form BEC 565. USAID has a number of blanket waivers already in effect for certain countries that are applicable to its direct contracts with contractors performing in such countries. Where such waivers are granted from coverage under the DBA, the waiver is conditioned on providing other worker's compensation coverage to employees to which the waiver applies. Usually this takes the form of securing worker's compensation coverage of the country where work will be performed or of the country of the employee's nationality, whichever offers greater benefits. The Department of Labor has granted partial blanket waivers of DBA coverage applicable to USAID-financed contracts performed in certain countries, subject to two conditions:

        (1) Employees hired in the United States by the contractor, and citizens or residents of the United States are to be provided DBA insurance coverage;

        (2) Waived employees (i.e., employees who are neither U.S. citizens nor U.S. resident aliens, and who were hired outside the United States) will be provided worker's compensation benefits as required by the laws of the country in which they are working or the laws of their native country, whichever offers greater benefits. Information as to whether a DBA Waiver has been obtained by USAID for a particular country may be obtained from the cognizant USAID contracting officer.

        (b) To assist contractors in securing insurance at minimal rates for the workmen's compensation insurance required under the DBA, and to facilitate meeting insurance requirements for such coverage, USAID, after open and competitive negotiation, has entered into a contract with an insurance carrier to provide such coverage at a specified rate. The terms of this contract require the insurance carrier to provide coverage, and the contractor to make payments to and handle its claims with that insurance carrier. Contracting officers are responsible for explaining and advising contractors of the details of securing such insurance.

This supplemental coverage is specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-7, and is to be used in all USAID-direct contracts involving performance overseas.

#### § 728.307-70

        The contracting officer must insert the clause at 752.228-70 in all contracts which require performance by contractor employees overseas.

        728.309   Contract clause for worker's compensation insurance.

#### § 728.309

        (a) Because of the volume of projects performed overseas resulting in contracts which require worker's compensation insurance, USAID has contracted with an insurance carrier to provide the required insurance for all USAID contractors. It is therefore necessary to supplement the (48 CFR) FAR clause at 52.228-3 with the additional coverage specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-3. The coverage specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-3 shall be used in addition to the coverage specified in (48 CFR) FAR 52.228-3 in all USAID-direct contracts involving performance overseas.

        728.313   Contract clauses for insurance of transportation or transportation-related services.

#### § 728.313

        (a) USAID is required by law to include language in all its direct contracts and subcontracts ensuring that all U.S. marine insurance companies have a fair opportunity to bid for marine insurance when such insurance is necessary or appropriate under the contract. USAID has therefore established a supplementary preface to the clause at (48 CFR) FAR 52.228-9. This supplementary preface is set forth in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-9, and is required for use in any USAID-direct contract where marine insurance is necessary or appropriate.

#### § 729.402-70

        (a) The annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (SFOAA) requires USAID to take certain steps to prevent countries from imposing taxes, including value added tax (VAT) and customs duties, on U.S. foreign assistance, or if imposed, requires the countries to reimburse the assessed taxes or duties. The SFOAA also requires certain reporting to Congress on host country taxation. Because countries imposing such taxes assess them directly on contractors, USAID requires contractors to report annually on whether taxes have been imposed and, if so, whether the foreign government reimbursed the taxes.

        (b) The contracting officer must insert the clause at § 752.229-71, Reporting of Foreign Taxes, in solicitations and resulting contracts when:

        (1) A contract is fully or partially funded with funds appropriated under titles III through VI of an SFOAA making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs, and

        (2) The contract is to be performed wholly or partly in a foreign country.

        (b)  USAID policy requires contractors to obtain contracting officer approval of the following, unless an exception in paragraph (c) of the clause at 752.231-72 applies:

        (1) A conference funded in whole, or in part, by USAID when ten (10) or more USAID employees or personal services contractors are required to travel on temporary duty status to attend the conference; or

        731.205-70   Overseas recruitment incentive.

#### § 731.205-70

        (a) If a contractor employee serving overseas under a contract does not qualify for the exemption for overseas income provided under section 911 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 911), such employee is eligible to receive an overseas recruitment incentive (ORI), to the extent the ORI: Is authorized by the contractor's normal policy and practice; is deemed necessary by the contractor to recruit and retain qualified employees for overseas services; and does not exceed 10% of the base salary of the employee from date of arrival at overseas post to begin assignment to date of departure from post at the end of assignment. ORI is to be paid as a single payment at the end of the employee tour of duty overseas. The contractor shall take all reasonable and prudent steps to ensure that ORI is not paid to any employee who has received the IRS section 911 exemption.

        (b) In the event that an employee subsequently receives a section 911 exclusion for any part of the base salary upon which this supplement has been paid, such supplement or appropriate portion thereof shall be reimbursed by the contractor to USAID with interest. The interest shall be calculated at the average U.S. Treasury rate in effect for the period that the contractor or his employee had the funds. Neither the contractor's nor the subcontractor's inability to collect refunds from eligible employees shall be used as a basis to excuse subsequent refunds by the contractor to USAID.

Per diem, invitational travel, honoraria and payment for work carried out outside of normal working hours are not considered to be salary supplements subject to the provisions in USAID policy referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) Salary supplements are eligible for USAID financing only when authorized in accordance with USAID policy established in the cable State 119780 dated April 15, 1988 in ADS Chapter 302. If salary supplements have been authorized in a particular case, the contracting officer shall provide written approval to the contractor in order for such costs to be eligible. Any specific requirements or limitations shall be specified in the approval.

        (d) Contracting officers shall insert the Clause at 752.231-71 in all contracts in which there is a possibility of the need of HG employees. It should also be inserted in all subsequent subcontracts.

        (ii) For faculty members working under academic year appointments, salary for service under the contract may include the employee's on-campus academic year salary plus “consulting income” as defined above earned during the year proceeding employment under the contract, or salary for service under the contract may be derived by annualizing the academic year salary (in which case “consulting income” may not be included).

Where an item of cost requiring prior approval is included in the award budget, approval of the budget constitutes prior approval of that cost, unless otherwise specified. Accordingly, contract budgets must include one of the following statements:

        736.602-3   Evaluation board functions.

#### § 736.602-3

        Agency architect-engineer evaluation boards shall perform the following functions:

        (a) Prepare a selection memorandum recommending no less than three firms which are considered most highly qualified to perform the required services for submission to the head of the contracting activity for his/her approval. This selection memorandum shall include the information specified in 736.602-3(c).

        (b) In evaluating architect-engineer firms, the architect-engineer evaluation board shall apply the following criteria, other criteria established by Agency regulations, and any criteria set forth in the public notice on a particular contract:

        (1) Specialized experience of the firm (including each member of joint venture or association) with the type of service required;

        (2) Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations;

        (3) Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules, to the extent such information is available;

        (4) Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel from the organization, including a competent supervising representative having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a similar nature;

        (5) The portions of the work the architect-engineer is able to perform with its own forces when required;

        (6) Ability of the architect-engineer to furnish or to obtain required materials and equipment;

        (7) If the geographical or topographical aspects of the project are deemed vital, familiarity with the locality where the project is situated;

        (8) Financial capacity;

        (9) Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards provided in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 9.1. No contract may be awarded to a contractor that does not meet these standards;

        (10) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Agency, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of architect-engineer contracts among qualified firms. Each architect-engineer evaluation board shall give favorable consideration, to the fullest extent practicable to the most highly qualified firms that have not had prior experience on Government projects (including small business firms and firms owned by the socially and/or economically deprived).

        (c) The evaluation board shall prepare a selection memorandum for the approval of the head of the contracting activity. The selection memorandum will be signed by the board chairman and cleared by each board member. The selection memorandum shall include the following information:

        (1) A listing by name of all firms reviewed by the board;

        (2) A listing of the evaluation criteria applied;

        (3) An analysis of the selection showing the rationale for the board's recommendation;

        (4) The board's recommendation of the three most highly qualified firms, in order of preference;

        (5) An independent Government cost estimate. The evaluation board shall require the project engineer to develop an independent Government estimate of the cost of the required architect-engineer services. Consideration shall be given to the estimated value of the services to be rendered, the scope, complexity, and the nature of the project and the estimated costs expected to be generated by the work. The independent Government estimate shall be revised as required during negotiations to correct noted deficiencies and reflect changes in or clarification of, the scope of the work to be performed by the architect-engineer. A cost estimate based on the application of percentage factors to cost estimates of the various segments of the work involved, e.g., construction project, may be developed for comparison purposes, but such a cost estimate shall not be used as a substitute for the independent Government estimate.

        742.1170   Performance monitoring and progress reporting.

#### § 742.1170

        742.1170-1   General.

#### § 742.1170-1

        Performance monitoring is a function of contract administration used to determine contractor progress towards achieving the goals and objectives of the contract and to identify any factors that may delay or prevent the accomplishment of those goals and objectives. Performance monitoring requires USAID personnel, particularly the contracting officer's representative, to maintain adequate knowledge of the contractor's activities and progress in order to ensure that USAID's objectives, as stated in the contract's Statement of Work, will be achieved.

> [72 FR 53163, Sept. 18, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014]

        742.1170-2   Applicability.

#### § 742.1170-2

        (a) This section applies to USAID non-personal, professional/technical services contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, but may be applied to other USAID contracts, if the contracting officer and requiring office determine that doing so is in the best interests of the Agency. The contracting officer must ensure that this determination is documented in the contract file. This section does not apply to personal services contracts.

        (b) The underlying principles of (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 apply to USAID contracts and are inherent to this section. However, not all of the specific requirements and terminology in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 are compatible with the types of technical assistance contracts usually awarded by USAID. Therefore, this section 742.1170 applies when the requirements of (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 do not meet USAID requirements or are otherwise not appropriate.

        (c) The progress reports discussed in this section are separate from the performance evaluation reports prepared in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.15 and internal Agency procedures, although they may be used by USAID personnel or their authorized representatives when evaluating the contractor's performance. Furthermore, the policies, procedures, and limitations of this section do not apply to technical reports, studies, papers, etc., the acquisition of which may be part of or even the sole purpose of the contract.

> [72 FR 53163, Sept. 18, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 74996, Dec. 16, 2014]

        742.1170-3   Policy.

#### § 742.1170-3

        (a) The contractor is responsible for timely contract performance. Performance monitoring by USAID does not obviate this responsibility.

        (b) The requiring office, particularly the contracting officer's representative and the contracting officer, will determine how to monitor the contractor's performance to protect the Government's interests, by considering:

        (1) The contract requirements for reporting progress;

        (2) The contract requirements for an activity monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan, as applicable;

        (3) The contract performance schedule;

        (4) The contractor's implementation plan or workplan;

        (5) The contractor's history of contract performance;

        (6) The contractor's experience with the services or supplies being provided under the contract;

        (7) The contractor's financial capability;

        (8) Any other factors the requiring office, particularly the contracting officer's representative and the contracting officer, considers appropriate and necessary to adequately monitor contractor performance (for example, the day-to-day working proximity of the contracting officer's representative or contracting officer to the contractor's place of performance).

        (c) In monitoring contractor performance, the requiring office (particularly the contracting officer's representative and contracting officer) must utilize any of the contractor's existing systems or processes for monitoring progress, provided that doing so is not contrary to the terms of the contract. The requiring officer or contracting officer's representative must not require anything from the contractor that is outside the scope or terms of the contract or may result in claims of waivers, of changes, or of other contract modifications. Further, progress reports shall not require information already available from other sources.

> [72 FR 53163, Sept. 18, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014; 89 FR 37961, May 6, 2024]

        742.1170-4   Progress reporting requirements and contract clause.

#### § 742.1170-4

        (a) When the requiring office needs information on contract performance status on a regular basis, the contracting officer may require the contractor to submit periodic progress reports, tailored to address specific contract requirements but limited to only that information essential to USAID's needs in monitoring the contractor's progress.

        (b) Because the contracting officer's representative is the individual most familiar with the contractor's performance, the contractor must submit the progress reports directly to the cognizant technical officer. The contracting officer's representative must review the reports and advise the contracting officer, in writing, of any recommended action, including any action needed to address potential or actual delays in performance. The contracting officer's representative must so advise the contracting officer in sufficient time, typically thirty days, for him or her to take any action that the contracting officer determines is appropriate. The requirements of this paragraph do not relieve the contractor of notification requirements identified elsewhere in the contract.

        (c) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 752.242-70, Periodic Progress Reports, in solicitations and contracts that require progress reporting, as specified in this section. The contracting officer must include specific reporting instructions in the Schedule.

        742.1170-5   Activity Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Plan requirement and contract clause.

#### § 742.1170-5

        (a) When the requiring office needs information on how the contractor expects to monitor implementation performance and context, conduct or collaborate on an evaluation, and generate evidence to inform learning and adaptive management, the contracting officer may require the contractor to submit an Activity Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Plan (AMELP) tailored to specific contract requirements. For more information on monitoring, evaluation, and learning during the design and implementation of activities, see ADS Chapter 201 at

        (b) Unless instructed otherwise in writing by the requiring office, the contracting officer must insert the clause at 752.242-71 in section F of solicitations and contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The contracting officer may insert this clause in other USAID contracts if the contracting officer, in consultation with the requiring office, determines that an Activity Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Plan is necessary, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) The clause is not required to be included in contracts for:

        (1) Supplies and services that USAID acquires for its own direct use or benefit;

        (2) Emergency food assistance under the Food for Peace Act or section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including for the procurement, transportation, storage, handling and/or distribution of such assistance;

        (3) International disaster assistance under section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or other authorities administered by the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance; or

        (4) Activities managed by the Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization's Office of Transition Initiatives, or fully or partially funded with the Complex Crises Fund.

      Subpart 750.71—Extraordinary Contractual Actions To Protect Foreign Policy Interests of the United States

        750.7100   Scope of subpart.

#### § 750.7100

        This subpart specifies the standards and the procedures relating to requests for extraordinary contractual actions under Executive Order 11223.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7101   Authority.

#### § 750.7101

        Under section 633 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 75 Stat. 454 (22 U.S.C. 2933), as amended; Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 1965, as amended; and Executive Order 12163, dated September 29, 1979, as amended, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development has authority to provide extraordinary contractual relief.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7102   General policy.

#### § 750.7102

        Extra-contractual claims arising from foreign assistance contracts will be processed similarly to claims for extraordinary relief under FAR part 50, and in consideration of the circumstances and authorities granted by the Foreign Assistance Act.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7103   [Reserved]

#### § 750.7103

        750.7104   Types of actions.

#### § 750.7104

        The types of actions that may be taken pursuant to the direction of the approving authority under the Executive Order 11223 are: contractual adjustments such as amendments without consideration, correction of mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7105   Approving authority.

#### § 750.7105

        All authority to approve actions under this subpart is delegated to the M/OAA Director. The cognizant contracting officer will take appropriate contractual action pursuant to the decision of the M/OAA Director.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7106   Standards for deciding cases.

#### § 750.7106

        750.7106-1   General.

#### § 750.7106-1

        The mere fact that losses occur under a contract is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority conferred by Executive Order 11223. Whether, in a particular case, an action will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States is fact specific. Examples of the types of cases where action may be proper are set forth in 750.7106-2 through 750.7106-4.  Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant action.

> [49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7106-2   Amendments without consideration.

#### § 750.7106-2

        (a) Where an actual or threatened loss under a foreign assistance contract, however caused, will impair the productive ability of a contractor whose continued performance of any foreign assistance contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply is found to be essential to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States, the contract may be adjusted to the extent necessary to avoid such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.

        (b) Where a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a diminution of anticipated profits) on a foreign assistance contract as a result of Government action, the character of the Government action will generally determine whether any adjustment in the contract will be made and its extent. Where the Government action is directed primarily at the contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the other contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so requires; thus where such Government action, although not creating any liability on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations of fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.

> [49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7106-3   Mistakes.

#### § 750.7106-3

        (a) A contract may be amended or modified to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake, including in the following situations:

        (1) A mistake or ambiguity in the contract that results from the failure to clearly express the agreement as understood by both parties;

        (2) A mistake on the part of the contractor which is so obvious that it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer; and

        (3) A mutual mistake as to a material fact.

        (b) Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible delay normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by expediting the program and by giving contractors proper assurance that such mistakes will be corrected expeditiously and fairly. An action that can be accomplished by administrative modification or resolved using the procedures in FAR subpart 33.2 should not be resolved using the authority and procedures of this subpart.

> [89 FR 4207, Jan. 23, 2024]

        750.7106-4   Informal commitments.

#### § 750.7106-4

        Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances to permit payment to persons who have taken action without a formal contract; for example, where any person, pursuant to written or oral instructions from an officer or official of the Agency and relying in good faith upon the apparent authority of the officer or official to issue such instructions, has arranged to furnish or has furnished property or services to the agency and/or to a foreign assistance contractor or subcontractor without formal contractual coverage for such property or services. Formalization of commitments under such circumstances normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by assuring persons that they will be treated fairly and paid expeditiously.

        750.7107   Limitations upon exercise of authority.

#### § 750.7107

        (a) Executive Order 11223 does not provide authority for:

        (1) The award of a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract;

        (2) The payment of profit or fees in excess of applicable limitations; or

        (3) The waiver of any requirement to post a bid, payment, performance, or other bond required by law.

        (b)(1) Executive Order 11223 does not authorize the issuance of a modification, unless:

        (i) With respect to cases falling within Section 4 of Executive Order 11223, the approving authority determines that the action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States; and

        (ii) No other legal authority authorizes issuance of such modification.

        (2) A modification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be within the limits of the amounts appropriated and the statutory contract authorization as referenced in FAR 50.102-3.

        (c) No contract shall be modified unless the contractor submits a request prior to all obligations (including final payment) under the contract having been discharged.

        (d) An informal commitment must not be formalized unless:

        (1) The contractor submits a written request for payment within six months after furnishing, or arranging to furnish, supplies or services in reliance upon the commitment;

        (2) USAID has received the services satisfactorily performed, or has accepted property furnished in reliance on the commitment;

        (3) The USAID employee alleged to have made the informal commitment has affirmatively acknowledged responsibility for making the informal commitment in question; and

        (4) USAID has taken appropriate action to prevent recurrence.
