### Part 1104

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51160, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1104.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1104.1

      This part provides an update to the DoD interim implementation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR part 200. It supersedes the initial interim implementation of that guidance that DoD adopted in 2 CFR part 1103 on December 19, 2014.

      § 1104.100   Award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.

#### § § 1104.100

      DoD Components must conform the format of new grants and cooperative agreements to the standard award format specified in part 1120 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) (2 CFR part 1120). The standard format provides locations within the award for:

      (a) General terms and conditions, including the administrative and national policy requirements discussed in § 1104.105(a) and (b), respectively.

      (b) Any award-specific terms and conditions discussed in § 1104.110.

      § 1104.105   Regulations governing DoD Components' general terms and conditions.

#### § § 1104.105

      (a)  On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, the following regulatory provisions govern the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements:

      (1) The provisions of parts 1126 through 1138 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR parts 1126 through 1138, which comprise subchapter D of this chapter) govern the administrative requirements to be included in the general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

      (2) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.

      (b)  Part 1122 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR part 1122) governs the national policy requirements to be included in DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to all types of entities.

      § 1104.110   Regulations governing DoD Components' award-specific terms and conditions.

#### § § 1104.110

      On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200:

      (a) The guidance in 2 CFR part 200 governs administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions used to supplement the general terms and conditions of a new grant or cooperative agreement awarded to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe.

      (b) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.

      § 1104.115   Regulations governing DoD Components' internal procedures.

#### § § 1104.115

      On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, DoD Components' internal pre-award, time-of-award, and post-award procedures will continue to comply with requirements in parts 21 and 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 21 and 22) and other applicable Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) policies.

      § 1104.120   Definitions.

#### § § 1104.120

      (a)  means the regulations in chapter I, subchapter C of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, and chapter XI of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations.

      (b)  See part 1108 of the DoDGARs for definitions of other terms used in this part.

    PARTS 1105-1107 [RESERVED]

### Part 1105-1107

    PART 1108—DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN SUBCHAPTERS A THROUGH F OF THIS CHAPTER

### Part 1108

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51230, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General

        § 1108.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1108.1

        (a) This part provides:

        (1) Definitions of terms used in subchapters A through F of this chapter; and

        (2) Background information as context for understanding terms related to assistance and acquisition purposes, legal instruments that DoD Components make at the prime tier, and lower-tier transactions into which recipients and subrecipients enter when carrying out programs at lower tiers under DoD awards.

        (b) This part is, for DoD, the regulatory implementation of OMB guidance in subpart A of 2 CFR part 200.

        § 1108.2   Precedence of definitions of terms in national policy requirements.

#### § § 1108.2

        (a)  Some portions of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) may use a term in relation to compliance with a national policy requirement in a statute, Executive order, or other source that defines the term differently than it is defined in subpart B of this part. For purposes of that particular national policy requirement, the definition of a term provided by the source of the requirement and any regulation specifically implementing it takes precedence over the definition in subpart B of this part. Using the definition of a term that takes precedence for each national policy requirement is therefore important when determining the applicability and effect of that requirement.

        (b)  (1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:

        (i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);

        (ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;

        (iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and

        (iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.

        (2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term “State” is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.

        § 1108.3   Definitions of terms used in the Governmentwide cost principles or single audit requirements.

#### § § 1108.3

        (a) Some DoDGARs provisions state that DoD Components or recipients must comply with single audit or cost principles requirements in a Governmentwide issuance that contains defined terms and include the requirements by reference to the issuance without restating them.

        (b) For any term in one of those issuances, this part includes the definition of the term only if the DoDGARs also use that term directly.

        (c) If the DoDGARs only use the term indirectly,  through the DoDGARs' reference to the issuance, then this part will not include a definition and a user of the DoDGARs should consult definitions in the pertinent Governmentwide source, as follows:

        (1) The Single Audit Act requirements for audits of recipients and subrecipients that are in subpart F of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200;

        (2) The Governmentwide cost principles for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes that are contained in subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200; and

        (3) The cost principles for for-profit entities at Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231.

        § 1108.4   Definitions of terms that vary depending on context.

#### § § 1108.4

        DoDGARs definitions of some terms related to types of legal instruments ( “contract”) and purposes for which they are used ( “procurement” or “acquisition”) may vary, depending on the context. Appendix A to this part provides additional information about those terms and their definitions.

      Subpart B—Definitions

        § 1108.10   Acquire.

#### § § 1108.10

        means to:

        (a) When the term is used in connection with a DoD Component action at the prime tier, obtain property or services by purchase, lease, or barter for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government.

        (b) When the term is used in connection with a recipient action or a subrecipient action at a tier under a DoD Component's award:

        (1) Purchase services;

        (2) Obtain property under the award by:

        (i) Purchase;

        (ii) Construction;

        (iii) Fabrication;

        (iv) Development;

        (v) The recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property to the project or program under the award to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement ( including within the entity's share of the award's project costs the value of the remaining life of the property or its fair market value, rather than charging depreciation); or

        (vi) Otherwise.

        § 1108.15   Acquisition.

#### § § 1108.15

        means the process of acquiring as described in:

        (a) Paragraph (a) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with DoD Component actions at the prime tier.

        (b) Paragraph (b) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with recipient or subrecipient actions at a lower tier under a DoD Component's award.

        § 1108.20   Acquisition cost.

#### § § 1108.20

        means the cost of an asset to a recipient or subrecipient, including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use.

        (a) For example, when used in conjunction with:

        (1) The purchase of equipment, the term means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.

        (2) Equipment that a recipient or subrecipient constructs or fabricates—or software that it develops—under an award, the term includes, when capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):

        (i) The construction and fabrication costs of that equipment; and

        (ii) The development costs of that software.

        (b) Ancillary charges, such as taxes, duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in, or excluded from, the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.

        § 1108.25   Administrative offset.

#### § § 1108.25

        means an action whereby money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a recipient is withheld to satisfy a delinquent debt.

        § 1108.30   Advance payment.

#### § § 1108.30

        means a payment that DoD or a recipient or subrecipient makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for project or program purposes.

        § 1108.35   Advanced research.

#### § § 1108.35

        means advanced technology development that creates new technology or demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology to new products and processes in a general way. _Advanced research_ is most closely analogous to precompetitive technology development in the commercial sector ( early phases of research and development on which commercial competitors are willing to collaborate, because the work is not so coupled to specific products and processes that the results of the work must be proprietary). It does not include development of military systems and hardware where specific requirements have been defined. It is typically funded in Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.

        § 1108.40   Agreements officer.

#### § § 1108.40

        means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate technology investment agreements.

        § 1108.45   Applied research.

#### § § 1108.45

        means efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, such as new materials, devices, methods and processes. It typically is funded in Applied Research (Budget Activity 2) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. _Applied research_ often follows basic research but may not be fully distinguishable from the related basic research. The term does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered for sale or acquisition, efforts that are within the definition of “development.”

        § 1108.50   Approved budget.

#### § § 1108.50

        means, in conjunction with a DoD Component award to a recipient, the most recent version of the budget the recipient submitted, and the DoD Component approved (either at the time of the initial award or subsequently), to summarize planned expenditures for the project or program under the award. It includes:

        (a) All Federal funding made available to the recipient under the award to use for project or program purposes.

        (b) Any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.

        (c) Any options that have been exercised but not any options that have not yet been exercised.

        § 1108.55   Assistance.

#### § § 1108.55

        means the transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments that DoD Components use to provide assistance.

        § 1108.60   Award.

#### § § 1108.60

        means a grant, cooperative agreement, technology investment agreement, or other nonprocurement instrument subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs. Within each part of the regulations, the term includes only the types of instruments subject to that part.

        § 1108.65   Award administration office.

#### § § 1108.65

        means a DoD Component office that performs post-award functions related to the administration of grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment agreements, or other nonprocurement instruments subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs.

        § 1108.70   Basic research.

#### § § 1108.70

        means efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. For the purposes of the DoDGARs, basic research includes:

        (a) Research-related, science and engineering education and training, including graduate fellowships and research traineeships; and

        (b) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.

        § 1108.75   Capital asset.

#### § § 1108.75

        means a tangible or intangible asset used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which is capitalized in accordance with GAAP. _Capital asset_s include:

        (a) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software) whether acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, lease-purchase, exchange, or through capital leases; and

        (b) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life (not ordinary repairs and maintenance).

        § 1108.80   Claim.

#### § § 1108.80

        means a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to an award seeking as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of an award term or condition, or other relief arising under or relating to the award. A routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted to a claim by written notice to the grants or agreements officer if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

        § 1108.85   Cognizant agency for indirect costs.

#### § § 1108.85

        means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs for a particular entity may be different than the cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for indirect costs:

        (a) For an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe is assigned as described in the appendices to 2 CFR part 200. See 2 CFR 200.19 for specific citations to those appendices.

        (b) For a for-profit entity, normally will be the agency with the largest dollar amount of pertinent business, as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR 42.003.

        § 1108.90   Contract.

#### § § 1108.90

        means a procurement transaction, as that term is defined in this subpart. A contract is a transaction into which a recipient or subrecipient enters. It is therefore distinct from the term “procurement contract,” which is a transaction that a DoD Component awards at the prime tier.

        § 1108.95   Contracting activity.

#### § § 1108.95

        means an activity to which the Head of a DoD Component has delegated broad authority regarding acquisition functions pursuant to 48 CFR 1.601.

#### § § 1108.100

        means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate procurement contracts and make related determinations and findings.

        § 1108.105   Contractor.

#### § § 1108.105

        means an entity to which a recipient or subrecipient awards a procurement transaction (also known as a contract).

        § 1108.110   Cooperative agreement.

#### § § 1108.110

        means a legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition of “grant” in this subpart), except that substantial involvement is expected between DoD and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The term does not include “cooperative research and development agreements” as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a.

        § 1108.115   Co-principal investigator.

#### § § 1108.115

        means any one of a group of individuals whom an organization that is carrying out a research project with DoD support designates as sharing the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the research intellectually and logistically, other than the one among the group identified as the primary contact for scientific, technical, and related budgetary matters (see the definition of “principal investigator”).

        § 1108.120   Cost allocation plan.

#### § § 1108.120

        means either a:

        (a) Central service cost allocation plan, as defined at 2 CFR 200.9 and described in Appendix V to 2 CFR part 200; or

        (b) Public assistance cost allocation plan as described in Appendix VI to 2 CFR part 200.

        § 1108.125   Cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 1108.125

        means the portion of project costs not borne by the Federal Government, unless a Federal statute authorizes use of any Federal funds for cost sharing or matching.

        § 1108.128   Cost type award.

#### § § 1108.128

        means an award that a DoD Component makes that provides for the recipient to be paid based on the actual, allowable costs it incurs in carrying out the award.

        § 1108.130   Cost-type contract.

#### § § 1108.130

        means a procurement transaction awarded by a recipient or a subrecipient at any tier under a DoD Component's grant or cooperative agreement that provides for the contractor to be paid on the basis of the actual, allowable costs it incurs (plus any fee or profit for which the contract provides).

        § 1108.135   Cost-type subaward.

#### § § 1108.135

        means a subaward that:

        (a) A recipient or subrecipient makes to another entity at the next lower tier; and

        (b) Provides for payments to the entity that receives the cost-type subaward based on the actual, allowable costs it incurs in carrying out the subaward.

        § 1108.140   Debarment.

#### § § 1108.140

        means an action taken by a Federal agency debarring official to exclude a person or entity from participating in covered Federal transactions, in accordance with debarment and suspension policies and procedures for:

        (a) Nonprocurement instruments, which are in OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by the DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; or

        (b) Procurement contracts, which are in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR 9.4.

        § 1108.145   Debt.

#### § § 1108.145

        means any amount of money or any property owed to a Federal agency by any person, organization, or entity except another United States Federal agency. _Debt_s include any amounts due from insured or guaranteed loans, fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, or overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and forfeitures, and all other claims and similar sources. For the purposes of this chapter, amounts due a non-appropriated fund instrumentality are not debts owed the United States.

        § 1108.150   Delinquent debt.

#### § § 1108.150

        means a debt:

        (a) That the debtor fails to pay by the date specified in the initial written notice from the agency owed the debt, normally within 30 calendar days, unless the debtor makes satisfactory payment arrangements with the agency by that date; and

        (b) With respect to which the debtor has elected not to exercise any available appeals or has exhausted all agency appeal processes.

        § 1108.155   Development.

        (a) $5,000; or

        (b) The recipient's or subrecipient's capitalization threshold for financial statement purposes.

        § 1108.175   Exempt property.

#### § § 1108.175

        (a)  means tangible personal property acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds under a DoD Component's awards, for which the DoD Component:

        (1) Has statutory authority to vest title in recipients (or allow for vesting in subrecipients) without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component considers appropriate; and

        (2) Elects to use that authority to do so.

        (b) An example of exempt property authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6306) for tangible personal property acquired under an award to conduct basic or applied research by a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research.

      Subpart A—Award Cover Pages

        § 1120.100   Purpose of the award cover pages.

#### § § 1120.100

        The award cover pages comprise the portion of each DoD Component award of a grant or cooperative agreement or modification to an award that the DoD Component transmits to the recipient when it makes the award or modification. It:

        (a) Contains basic information about the award or modification and the recipient, as described in § 1120.105;

        (b) Is signed by a DoD grants officer; and

        (c) Also is signed by the recipient's authorized organizational representative if the award or modification is a bilateral action that is to be signed on behalf of both the DoD Component and recipient.

        § 1120.105   Content of the award cover pages.

#### § § 1120.105

        The award cover pages of each DoD Component grant or cooperative agreement or modification:

        (a) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the award or modification:

        (1) The name of the DoD Component awarding office that made the award or modification.

        (2) The award number (Federal Award Identification Number or FAIN) and, if the action is a modification, the modification number.

        (3) The type of award— grant or cooperative agreement.

        (4) The type of award action— new award, funding modification, or administrative (non-funding) modification. For an administrative modification, the award cover pages should include a brief description of the purpose of the modification ( a no-cost extension of the end date of the period of performance).

        (5) For a new award or funding modification:

        (i) A brief description of the project or program supported by the award.

        (ii) The amount of the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds due to the current action and any accompanying change in the total amount of cost sharing or matching required under the award.

        (iii) The cumulative amounts of Federal funds and any corresponding non-Federal share obligated to date ( the sums of the amounts of the current action and the cumulative amounts of prior obligations and deobligations).

        (iv) The total amount of the project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, the Federal share of that amount, and the non-Federal share even if that share is “zero.”

        (v) The total value of the award; the Federal share of that total value (which includes Federal funding obligated to date; future incremental funding actions; and options for which amounts have been predetermined, whether or not they have been exercised yet); and the non-Federal share of that total value ( total cost sharing or matching required under the award).

        (vi) A table such as the following may be helpful in clearly presenting the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (vi) of this section:

        (6) The obligation date ( the date of the grants officer's signature) and, if different, the effective date.

        (7) The start date and current end date of the period of performance.

        (8) The statutory authority or authorities under which the award or modification was made.

        (9) The number and title of the program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under which the award or modification was made.

        (10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):

        (i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or “cluster”) of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).

        (ii) What the award includes in addition to the cover pages— the:

        (A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;

        (B) Approved budget; and

        (C) General, and any award specific, terms and conditions of the award.

        (iii) Where the portions of the award listed in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section are located, which content the DoD Component generally should incorporate into the award by reference. When incorporating that content into the award by reference, the DoD Component must both:

        (A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and

        (B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.

        (iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements ( Federal statutes).

        (v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award. If there are multiple individuals and offices for different post-award functions ( payments and property administration), the award cover pages should provide information about each.

        (vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.

        (b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:

        (1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

        (2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or “doing business as” name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.

        (3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.

        (4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.

        (5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply— the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate—if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.

        (c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:

        (1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.

        (2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.

        § 1120.110   Use of alternative to DoD form.

#### § § 1120.110

        (a) A DoD Component may use something other than a DoD form as its award cover pages only if:

        (1) There is not currently any DoD form for the award cover pages; or

        (2) The DoD Component obtains approval for a deviation from the requirement to use a DoD form from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in accordance with the procedures specified in 32 CFR 21.340.

        (b) If a DoD Component does not use a DoD form for its award cover pages, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, its award cover pages must include all information specified in § 1120.105.

      Subpart B—Award-specific Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.200   Purpose and inclusion of award-specific terms and conditions.

#### § § 1120.200

        A DoD Component must include with each award, for transmission to the recipient, any terms and conditions needed to communicate requirements specific to the individual award as distinct from the more broadly applicable requirements in the general terms and conditions. For a modification to an award, only changes to previously transmitted terms and conditions must be included.

        § 1120.205   Organization and wording of award-specific terms and conditions.

#### § § 1120.205

        DoD Components should organize and word award-specific terms and conditions to make them as clear and easy to understand as possible for the benefit of recipients, award administrators, auditors, and others who may need to use them. The DoDGARs specify neither a standard organization nor standard wording for award-specific terms and conditions.

      Subpart C—General Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.300   Purpose of general terms and conditions.

#### § § 1120.300

        The general terms and conditions comprise the portion of the award with requirements that apply to a class of awards ( awards under a particular program or type of program activity, such as research or education, or for a class of recipients, such as for-profit entities).

        § 1120.305   Requirement for general terms and conditions.

#### § § 1120.305

        Each DoD Component must establish at least one set of general terms and conditions. A DoD Component may have more than one set, as it deems appropriate to reflect differences in its award terms and conditions across different programs, classes of recipients, or types of activity.

        § 1120.310   Use of plain language.

#### § § 1120.310

        (a) DoD Components must use plain language in:

        (1) General terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Those awards are subject to the DoDGARs provisions in:

        (i) 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That standard wording uses personal pronouns.

        (ii) 2 CFR part 1122, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing commonly applicable national policy requirements. That standard wording also uses personal pronouns.

        (2) The national policy requirements in Subdivision B of general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities, which also are subject to 2 CFR part 1122.

        (b) Although the DoDGARs currently do not provide standard wording for terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements for use in awards to for-profit entities, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to use plain language and personal pronouns in their terms and conditions of those other awards. The DoDGARs provisions that specify the administrative requirements to incorporate into those terms and conditions are listed in § 1120.510(b).

        § 1120.315   Availability of general terms and conditions.

#### § § 1120.315

        (a) A DoD Component that issues a funding opportunity announcement under which grants or cooperative agreements may be awarded must maintain on the internet the general terms and conditions for those awards if:

        (1) The distribution of the funding opportunity announcement is unlimited; and

        (2) The DoD Component anticipates making 10 or more awards per year using those general terms and conditions.

        (b) Each DoD Component that maintains a set of general terms and conditions on the internet must also maintain an archive of previous versions of that set at the same internet location, for use by recipients, post-award administrators, auditors, and others. Each version must be labeled with its effective dates.

        (c) If a DoD Component has a set of general terms and conditions that is not subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the DoD Component chooses not to maintain that set on the internet:

        (1) It must tell potential applicants or proposers in the funding opportunity announcement, if there is one, how they may view or obtain a copy of the general terms and conditions; or

        (2) If there is no funding opportunity announcement ( if it is a noncompetitive program for which all recipients are known in advance), the DoD Component must provide the general terms and conditions to each recipient no later than the time of award.

      Subpart D—Preamble to the General Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.400   Requirement to include a preamble.

#### § § 1120.400

        Each DoD Component must include a preamble as Subdivision A of each set of general terms and conditions it maintains, to provide information to help recipients understand how to use those terms and conditions.

        § 1120.405   Content of the preamble.

#### § § 1120.405

        The preamble for each set of general terms and conditions must include at least the following information elements, organized in the order shown:

        (a)  This should show the articles within each other subdivision of the general terms and conditions (Subdivisions B and C for administrative and national policy requirements and, if needed, Subdivision D for programmatic requirements).

        (b)  This element identifies the programs, types of awards, and types of recipient entities that are subject to the set of general terms and conditions.

        (c)  This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions. The version date of each article within the general terms and conditions must be indicated in parentheses following the title of the article, to help a recipient identify the articles that changed from previous versions of the general terms and conditions.

        (d)  The purpose of this element of the preamble is to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.111(b) by informing each recipient that:

        (1) It must translate any of the award content (including attachments to it and any material incorporated into the award by reference) into another language to the extent that the recipient's compliance with the award's terms and conditions depends upon a significant number of its employees who are not fluent in English being able to read and comprehend that content.

        (2) If it does translate any award content into another language, either as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or at its own initiative, the original award content in the English language will take precedence in the event of an inconsistency between the award requirements in the English and translated versions.

        (e)  This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with § 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.

        (f)  Providing the definitions of words and phrases that are used in the general terms and conditions and defined in the DoDGARs is more helpful to recipients than referring them to the DoDGARs to find the definitions.

      Subpart E—Administrative Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.500   Scope of administrative requirements.

#### § § 1120.500

        The administrative requirements in an award are post-award and after-the-award requirements for recipients in the following subject matter areas:

        (a) Financial and program management, to include financial management system standards, payment, allowable costs, program and budget revisions, audits, cost sharing or matching, and program income.

        (b) Property administration, to include title vesting, property management system standards, and use and disposition of tangible and intangible property.

        (c) Recipient procurement procedures.

        (d) Financial, programmatic, property, and other reporting.

        (e) Records retention and access, remedies, claims and disputes, and closeout.

        § 1120.505   Location of administrative requirements in the standard award format.

#### § § 1120.505

        As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes administrative requirements as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.

        § 1120.510   Sources of administrative requirements.

#### § § 1120.510

        The source of administrative requirements is:

        (a) Subchapter D of this chapter for cost-type grant and cooperative agreement awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Subchapter D provides a standard set of articles into which a DoD Component organizes the administrative requirements. It also provides standard wording for the general terms and conditions in those articles, as explained in the overview of subchapter D in 2 CFR part 1126.

        (b) 32 CFR part 34 for grant and cooperative agreement awards to for-profit entities. That part of the DoDGARs specifies the administrative requirements for awards to those entities but does not provide standard articles or terms and conditions.

        § 1120.515   Incorporation of administrative requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

#### § § 1120.515

        (a) For cost-type awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements by:

        (1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of administrative requirements provided in subchapter D of this chapter (the standard wording of the articles is in the appendices to 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138) into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

        (2) Stating any variations from that standard wording ( any sections or paragraphs that the DoD Component adds, revises, or omits, consistent with the DoDGARs prescription for use of the standard wording).

        (b) Incorporating that standard wording into general terms and conditions by reference, rather than including the full text of each article of the general terms and conditions, will make it easier for those who must use terms and conditions of multiple DoD Components' awards ( recipients, DoD Components' post-award administrators, and auditors) to quickly identify how each Component's general terms and conditions differ from the DoD standard wording.

      Subpart F—National Policy Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.600   Scope of national policy requirements.

#### § § 1120.600

        National policy requirements, as defined in 2 CFR 1122.2, are requirements:

        (a) That are prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refer to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

        (b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

        (c) That are outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements, as described in § 1120.500.

        § 1120.605   Location of national policy requirements in the standard award format.

#### § § 1120.605

        As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes national policy requirements as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.

        § 1120.610   Source of national policy requirements.

#### § § 1120.610

        The source of national policy requirements to be included in a grant or cooperative agreement is 2 CFR part 1122.

        § 1120.615   Incorporation of national policy requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

#### § § 1120.615

        For the same reason given in § 1120.515(b), DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements for awards to all types of recipient entities, including for-profit entities, by:

        (a) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of national policy requirements provided in the appendices to 2 CFR part 1122 into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

        (b) Stating any variations from that standard wording ( any added, omitted, or revised paragraphs, based on which national policy requirements apply to programs and recipients for which the general terms and conditions are used).

      Subpart G—Programmatic Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

        § 1120.700   Scope of programmatic requirements.

#### § § 1120.700

        A requirement is most appropriately included in the programmatic requirements portion of the general terms and conditions if it:

        (a) Is not in one of the subject matter areas covered by the administrative requirements in Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions, as described in § 1120.500.

        (b) Does not meet the criteria in § 1120.600 for a national policy requirement.

        (c) Broadly applies to awards using the general terms and conditions. Requirements that apply to relatively few of those awards are more appropriately included in the award-specific terms and conditions of the individual awards to which they apply.

        (d) Is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future, rather than for a limited period of time. For example, a requirement in an annual appropriations act that applies specifically to funding made available by that act is better addressed through the award-specific terms and conditions of awards or modifications to which it applies.

        § 1120.705   Location of programmatic requirements in the standard award format.

#### § § 1120.705

        As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes programmatic requirements as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.

        § 1120.710   Examples of programmatic requirements.

#### § § 1120.710

        Examples of provisions appropriately included as programmatic requirements in Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions include:

        (a) Requirements for recipients to acknowledge the DoD Component's support in publications of results of the projects or programs performed under awards.

        (b) Requirements for recipients to promptly alert the DoD Component if they develop any information in the course of performing the projects or programs under their awards that, in their judgment, might adversely affect national security if disclosed.

        (c) Reservation of the Government's right to use non-Federal personnel in any aspect of post-award administration of awards, with appropriate nondisclosure requirements placed on those personnel to protect sensitive information about recipients or the projects or programs supported by their awards.

      § 1120.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1120.1

      This part of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) establishes a standard award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby makes the content easier for a recipient to locate in different DoD Components' awards.

      § 1120.2   Applicability of this part.

#### § § 1120.2

      (a)  This part:

      (1) Sets forth requirements for DoD Components that award grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) Does not impose requirements on recipients of DoD Components' awards.

      (b)  This part applies to grants and cooperative agreements, other than technology investment agreements (TIAs), awarded to any type of recipient entity.

      § 1120.3   DoD Component implementation.

#### § § 1120.3

      Each DoD Component that awards grants or cooperative agreements must:

      (a) Conform the format of its awards to the standard format established by this part no later than [18 months after the effective date of the final rule].

      (b) Update electronic systems it maintains for generating awards within 18 months of the issuance of a new or updated DoD form for the award cover pages, in order to implement that form in those systems, unless it has an approved deviation in accordance with § 1120.110.

      § 1120.4   Elements and subelements of the standard award format in relation to the organization of this part.

#### § § 1120.4

      (a) The standard award format has three major elements that are designated as Divisions I through III of the award.

      (1) The first major element of the standard award format is comprised of the award cover pages. It is designated as Division I of the award.

      (2) The second major element is comprised of any award-specific terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division II of the award.

      (3) The last of the three major elements of the standard award format is comprised of the general terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division III of the award. It has four subelements that are designated as Subdivisions A through D of the general terms and conditions.

      (i) The first subelement of the general terms and conditions is the preamble, which is designated as Subdivision A.

      (ii) The second subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.

      (iii) The third subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.

      (iv) The last of the four subelements of the general terms and conditions is comprised of any programmatic requirements that apply to awards using those general terms and conditions. That subelement is designated as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.

      (b) This part has seven subparts. Each subpart addresses one major element or subelement of the standard award format, as shown in Table 1:

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51225, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General

        § 1122.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1122.1

        (a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.

        (b) It thereby implements:

        (1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

        (2) National policy requirements, to the extent they apply, for general terms and conditions of DoD awards to for-profit firms, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities.

        § 1122.2   Definition of “national policy requirement.”

#### § § 1122.2

        For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:

        (a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

        (b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

        (c) That is outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements in subchapters D or E of this chapter.

        § 1122.3   Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.

#### § § 1122.3

        Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define “State in ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.

      Subpart B—Terms and Conditions

        § 1122.100   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 1122.100

        This subpart provides:

        (a) Direction to DoD Components on how to construct the four articles of national policy requirements for inclusion in the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements.

        (b) Standard wording for national policy requirements that are more commonly applicable to DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.

        § 1122.105   Where to find the terms and conditions.

#### § § 1122.105

        (a) Appendices A through D of this part provide standard wording of terms and conditions for the four articles of national policy requirements. The articles address the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the recipient related to those national policy requirements.

        (b) The following table shows which national policy terms and conditions may be found in each appendix to this part:

        § 1122.110   Organization of each article of national policy requirements.

#### § § 1122.110

        Each of NP Articles I through IV includes two sections.

        (a) Section A of each article includes national policy requirements that are cross-cutting in that their applicability extends to many or all DoD awards. Appendices A through D to this part provide standard wording for each of those requirements.

        (b) Section B of each article is the location in the award for program-specific national policy requirements. Section B is reserved in the standard wording of the articles provided in appendices A through D to this part.

        § 1122.115   Cross-cutting national policy requirements.

#### § § 1122.115

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the standard wording provided in appendices A through D to this part for each national policy requirement addressed in Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV, respectively, that may apply either to:

        (1) A recipient of an award using those general terms and conditions; or

        (2) A subrecipient of a subaward under an award using those general terms and conditions.

        (b)  A DoD Component may reserve or omit any paragraph appendices A through D to this part provide for Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV of its general terms and conditions if it determines that the national policy requirement addressed in that paragraph will not apply to any awards using those terms and conditions nor to any subawards under them.

        (c)  (1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

        (2) A DoD Component in that case:

        (i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.

        (ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.

        § 1122.120   Other national policy requirements.

#### § § 1122.120

        If a DoD Component determines that awards using its general terms and conditions, or subawards under them, are subject to a national policy requirement that is not addressed in the standard wording appendices A through D to this part provide for cross-cutting requirements, the DoD Component must include the requirement in its general terms and conditions. It should add the requirement in Section B of NP Article I, II, III, or IV, as most appropriate to the subject matter of the requirement.

      Subpart A—General

        § 1125.137   Who in the Department of Defense may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1125.137

        Within the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of a Military Department, Head of a Defense Agency, Head of the Office of Economic Adjustment, and Head of the Special Operations Command have the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.

      Subpart B—Covered Transactions

        § 1125.220   What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

#### § § 1125.220

        Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), the Department of Defense does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

      Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

        § 1125.332   What method must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 1125.332

        You as a participant in a covered transaction must include a term or condition in any lower-tier covered transaction into which you enter, to require the participant of that transaction to—

        (a) Comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180; and

        (b) Include a similar term or condition in any covered transaction into which it enters at the next lower tier.

      Subpart D—Responsibilities of DoD Officials Regarding Transactions

        § 1125.425   When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

#### § § 1125.425

        In addition to the four instances identified in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.425, you as a DoD Component official must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you obligate additional funding (, through an incremental funding action) for a pre-existing grant or cooperative agreement with an institution of higher education, as provided in 32 CFR 22.520(e)(5).

        § 1125.437   What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

#### § § 1125.437

        You as a DoD Component official must include a term or condition in each covered transaction into which you enter, to communicate to the participant the requirements to—

        (a) Comply with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part; and

        (b) Include a similar term or condition in any lower-tier covered transactions into which the participant enters.

#### § § 1125.930

        DoD Components' debarring officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as debarring officials for procurement contracts.

        § 1125.937   DoD Component.

#### § § 1125.937

        In this part, DoD Component means the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a Military Department, a Defense Agency, a DoD Field Activity, or any other organizational entity of the Department of Defense that is authorized to award or administer grants, cooperative agreements, or other nonprocurement transactions.

        § 1125.1010   Suspending official (DoD supplement to Governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.1010).

#### § § 1125.1010

        DoD Components' suspending officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as suspending officials for procurement contracts.

      § 1125.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 1125.10

      This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Department of Defense (DoD) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the Department of Defense to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

      § 1125.20   Does this part implement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180 for all DoD nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 1125.20

      This part implements the OMB guidelines in 2 CFR part 180 for most DoD nonprocurement transactions. However, it does not implement the guidelines as they apply to prototype projects under the authority of Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), as amended. The Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy maintains a DoD issuance separate from this part that addresses section 845 transactions.

      § 1125.30   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1125.30

      This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

      (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970, as supplemented by subpart B of this part), other than a section 845 transaction described in § 1125.20;

      (b) Respondent in a DoD Component's nonprocurement suspension or debarment action;

      (c) DoD Component's debarment or suspension official; or

      (d) DoD Component's grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into a nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

      § 1125.40   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 1125.40

      (a)  You must follow the policies and procedures specified in applicable sections of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by this part.

      (b)  In implementing the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, this part supplements eight sections of the guidance, as shown in the following table. For each of those sections, you must follow the policies and procedures in the OMB guidance, as supplemented by this part.

      (c)  For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that is not listed in paragraph (b) of this section, DoD policies and procedures are the same as those in the OMB guidance.

  SUBCHAPTER D—ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COST-TYPE GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS TO NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

## Subchapter D

    PART 1126—SUBCHAPTER D OVERVIEW

### Part 1126

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51171, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1126.1   Purposes of this subchapter.

#### § § 1126.1

      This subchapter of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations:

      (a) Addresses general terms and conditions governing administrative requirements for use by DoD Components when awarding cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. It does so by providing:

      (1) A standard organization of the administrative requirements into articles of general terms and conditions, each of which is in a specific subject area.

      (2) Standard wording for those articles; and

      (3) Associated prescriptions for DoD Component's use of the standard wording to construct their general terms and conditions, which allow for adding, omitting, or varying in other ways from the standard wording in certain situations.

      (b) Thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 as it relates to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

      § 1126.2   Applicability of this subchapter.

#### § § 1126.2

      (a)  This subchapter:

      (1) Applies to DoD Components that award cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

      (2) Does not directly impose requirements on a recipient of a DoD Component's award but does do so indirectly, through the DoD Component's compliance with this subchapter when it constructs its general award terms and conditions. The terms and conditions delineate the rights and responsibilities of the recipient and the Federal Government under the award.

      (b)  This subchapter applies to DoD Components' cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to types of entities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, other than Technology Investment Agreements that are addressed in 32 CFR part 37.

      § 1126.3   Exceptions from requirements in this subchapter.

#### § § 1126.3

      (a)  A DoD Component may not grant any exception to the requirements in this subchapter if the exception is:

      (1) Prohibited by statute, executive order, or regulation;

      (2) Inconsistent with the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

      (b)  Other exceptions are permitted from requirements in this subchapter for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes as follows:

      (1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may incorporate a requirement that is inconsistent with the requirements in this subchapter if that requirement is specifically authorized or required by a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

      (2)  The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may approve an individual exception affecting only one award in accordance with procedures stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

      (3)  A DoD Component's terms and conditions for small awards may apply less restrictive requirements than those specified in this subchapter (a small award is an award for which the total value of obligated funding through the life of the award is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold).

      (4)  The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering or his or her designee may approve any class exception affecting multiple awards other than small awards, with OMB concurrence if the class exception is for a requirement that is inconsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. Procedures for DoD Components' requests for class exceptions are stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

      § 1126.4   Relationship to other portions of the DoD grant and agreement regulations.

#### § § 1126.4

      The administrative requirements specified in this subchapter complement:

      (a) Provisions of 32 CFR part 34 that address administrative requirements for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities; and

      (b) Requirements in 32 CFR part 37 for technology investment agreements.

      § 1126.5   Organization of this subchapter.

#### § § 1126.5

      This subchapter is organized into six parts in addition to this overview part. Each part provides standard wording and prescriptions for articles of general terms and conditions that address administrative requirements in a particular subject area. Table 1 shows the subject area and articles corresponding to each part:

      § 1126.6   Organization of the other parts of this subchapter.

#### § § 1126.6

      (a) Each of parts 1128 through 1138 of this subchapter is organized into subparts and appendices.

      (1) Each appendix provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for one of the articles of general terms and conditions that the part addresses.

      (2) For each appendix addressing a particular article, the part has an associated subpart that provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording for that article.

      (b) For example, Table 1 to § 1126.5 indicates that 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles I through VII and the prescriptions for DoD Components' use of that standard wording.

      (1) FMS Article I on financial management system standards is the first of the articles that 2 CFR part 1128 covers. Appendix A to 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Article I. The associated subpart of 2 CFR part 1128, subpart A, provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording of that article.

      (2) Appendices B through G of 2 CFR part 1128 provide the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles II through VII, respectively. The associated subparts, Subparts B through G, provide the corresponding prescriptions for DoD Components.

    PART 1128—RECIPIENT FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Part 1128

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51171, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Financial Management System Standards (FMS Article I)

        § 1128.100   Purpose of FMS Article I.

#### § § 1128.100

        FMS Article I specifies standards for recipients' financial management systems. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

        (a) 2 CFR 200.302, 200.303, and 200.328; and

        (b) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting.

        § 1128.105   Content of FMS Article I.

#### § § 1128.105

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for recipients' financial management systems.

        (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for FMS Article I.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

        (i) Reserve Section A of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will receive:

        (A) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or

        (B) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.

        (ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments ( through unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between financial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve paragraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.

      Subpart B—Payments (FMS Article II)

        § 1128.200   Purpose of FMS Article II.

#### § § 1128.200

        FMS Article II contains requirements related to payments under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305.

        § 1128.205   Content of FMS Article II.

#### § § 1128.205

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address payment method; payment timing and amounts, which relate to cash management; frequency of payment requests; and matters related to recipients' depositories, including interest earned on advance payments.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix B to this part provides for FMS Article II with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as described in §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220.

        § 1128.210   Payment requirements for States.

#### § § 1128.210

        (a)  Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:

        (1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under “major programs,” as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.

        (2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States— awards that are not under major programs.

        (b) —(1)  Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.

        (2)  If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:

        (i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and

        (ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.

        § 1128.215   Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

#### § § 1128.215

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements—advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (1)  With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:

        (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and

        (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.

        (b) —(1)  Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:

        (i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and

        (ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.

        (2)  A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:

        (i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;

        (ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;

        (iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and

        (iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.

        § 1128.220   Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.

#### § § 1128.220

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.

        (b) —(1)  Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.

        (2)  A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.

      Subpart C—Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit (FMS Article III)

        § 1128.300   Purpose of FMS Article III.

#### § § 1128.300

        FMS Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies what costs are allowable as charges to awards and when they are allowable. It also specifies restrictions on payment of fee or profit. It thereby implements OMB guidance in §§ 200.209 and 200.309 and Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.201(b)(1) and 200.323(c), as those sections apply to the cost principles to be used in relation to subawards and contracts, respectively.

        § 1128.305   Content of FMS Article III.

#### § § 1128.305

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address allowability of costs and permissibility of fee or profit.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for FMS Article III with appropriate reservations as described in §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325.

        § 1128.310   Cost principles.

#### § § 1128.310

        (a)  The set of Governmentwide cost principles applicable to a particular entity type governs the allowability of costs that may be:

        (1) Charged to each cost-type:

        (i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;

        (ii) Subaward to a subrecipient of that entity type at any tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement; and

        (iii) Procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type awarded by a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

        (2) Considered in establishing the amount of any:

        (i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under a grant or cooperative agreement, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or

        (ii) Fixed-price procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type that is awarded by either a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

        (b) —(1)  Because almost all DoD grants and cooperative agreements are cost-type awards, appendix C includes wording for Section A of FMS Article III that specifies use of the applicable Governmentwide cost principles in the determination of the allowability of costs.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve any paragraph of appendix C's wording for Section A of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the Component is certain that no entities of the type to which the paragraph applies could be recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions or recipients of subawards or procurement transactions at any tier under those awards.

        § 1128.315   Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.

#### § § 1128.315

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge publication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

        (b) —(1)  To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article III.

        (2)  A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using those general terms and conditions.

        § 1128.320   Period of availability of funds.

#### § § 1128.320

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the period during which Federal funds are available for obligation by recipients for project or program purposes.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of FMS Article III to specify the period of availability of funds.

        § 1128.325   Fee or profit.

#### § § 1128.325

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients may neither receive fee or profit nor pay fee or profit to subrecipients.

        (b)  A DoD Component must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of FMS Article III to specify the limitation on payment of fee or profit.

      Subpart D—Revision of Budget and Program Plans (FMS Article IV)

        § 1128.400   Purpose of FMS Article IV.

#### § § 1128.400

        FMS Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to changes in recipients' budget and program plans. It thereby implements OMB guidance in § 200.308 of 2 CFR part 200 and partially implements § 200.209 and Subpart E of that part.

        § 1128.405   Content of FMS Article IV.

#### § § 1128.405

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the changes in budget and program plans for which a recipient is required to request DoD Component prior approval and the procedures for submitting those requests.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article IV the § wording appendix D to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.410 through 1128.430.

        § 1128.410   Approved budget.

#### § § 1128.410

        (a)  As described in 2 CFR 200.308(a), the approved budget for a grant or cooperative agreement may include both the Federal and non-Federal shares of funding under the award or only the Federal share.

        (b)  For DoD grants and cooperative agreements, the approved budget includes the Federal share and any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must include the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of FMS Article IV.

        § 1128.415   Prior approvals for non-construction activities.

#### § § 1128.415

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.

        (b)  The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions ( prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:

        (1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).

        (2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).

        (3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).

        (d)  A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:

        (1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).

        (2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).

        (e)  With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):

        (1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.

        (2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:

        (i) Which, if any, to waive; and

        (ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions ( a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).

        (f)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:

        (1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).

        (2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).

        (3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.

        (g)  (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.

        (2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.

        (3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies ( the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.

        (h)  Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:

        (1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.

        (2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.

        (3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).

        (4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section ( to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).

        (5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.

        § 1128.420   Prior approvals for construction activities.

#### § § 1128.420

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction grant or cooperative agreement or construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction activities.

        (b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) through terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions ( prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

        (c)  In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or awards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:

        (1) Must include the wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.

        (2) May reserve or remove the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C of FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction activities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as Section C).

        § 1128.425   Additional prior approval for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

#### § § 1128.425

        (a)  Guidance on an additional prior approval requirement for grants or cooperative agreements that support both construction and non-construction activities is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5).

        (b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5) through terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

        (c)  If a DoD Component establishes general terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities, the DoD Component may add the prior approval requirement for funding or budget transfers between construction and non-construction activities that is described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5). The wording that appendix D to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article IV includes a reserved paragraph B.3 in which the DoD Component may add appropriate wording to include that prior approval requirement.

        § 1128.430   Procedures for prior approvals.

#### § § 1128.430

        (a)  Guidance on procedures related to recipient requests for prior approval is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i).

        (b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i) for prior approval requests through award terms and conditions.

        (c)  A DoD Component must:

        (1) Include the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph D.1 of FMS Article IV of its general terms and conditions.

        (2) Insert appropriate wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph D.2 that appendix D to this part includes in FMS Article IV to specify:

        (i) The format the recipient must use when it requests approval for budget revisions. As described in 2 CFR 200.308(h), the award term may allow the recipient to submit a letter of request or otherwise must specify that the recipient use the same format it used for budget information in its application or proposal.

        (ii) Any other procedural instructions related to requests for prior approvals for budget or program revisions ( to whom requests must be submitted) that are common to the awards using the general terms and conditions. For procedural instructions that will vary from one award to another, it is appropriate to include wording that points to the award-specific terms and conditions as the source of the information.

      Subpart E—Non-Federal Audits (FMS Article V)

        § 1128.500   Purpose of FMS Article V.

#### § § 1128.500

        FMS Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to audits required under the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C., chapter 75). The article thereby implements for grants and cooperative agreements the OMB guidance in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

        § 1128.505   Content of FMS Article V.

#### § § 1128.505

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address audit requirements.

        (b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix E to this part provides for FMS Article V.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the wording in appendix E if there will be no subawards to for-profit entities under any award using those terms and conditions.

      Subpart F-Cost Sharing or Matching (FMS Article VI)

        § 1128.600   Purpose of FMS Article VI.

#### § § 1128.600

        FMS Article VI sets forth requirements concerning recipients' cost sharing or matching under awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

        (a) 2 CFR 200.306 and 200.308(c)(1)(vii); and

        (b) 2 CFR 200.434, in conjunction with FMS Article III in appendix C to this part.

        § 1128.605   Content of FMS Article VI.

#### § § 1128.605

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards under which there may be required cost sharing or matching must specify the criteria for determining allowability, methods for valuation, and requirements for documentation of cost sharing or matching.

        (b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VI the wording appendix F to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve FMS Article VI of its general terms and conditions if it determines that there will be no cost sharing or matching required under any of the awards using those terms and conditions.

        § 1128.610   General requirement for cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 1128.610

        (a)  (1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:

        (i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover pages.

        (ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any that involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.

        (iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of cost share or match.

        (2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific contributions included in the approved budget ( to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the approved budget).

        (b)  To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS Article VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require recipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        § 1128.615   General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 1128.615

        (a)  The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost sharing or matching under grants and cooperative agreements.

        (b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the allowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms and conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to accept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general terms and conditions.

        § 1128.620   Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 1128.620

        (a)  The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides that unrecovered indirect costs may only be included as part of cost sharing and matching with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

        (b)  DoD Components must allow any recipient that either has an approved negotiated indirect cost rate or is using the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f) to count unrecovered indirect costs toward any required cost sharing or matching under awards. The basis for this policy is that recipients' indirect costs that are allowable and allocable to DoD projects and programs are legitimate costs of carrying out those projects and programs.

        (c)  To implement the policy in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section C of FMS Article VI unless a statute requires otherwise.

        § 1128.625   Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 1128.625

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(3) specifies that, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, recipients may use program income to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of their awards.

        (b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using either:

        (i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1128.720; or

        (ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of § 1128.720, that includes use of at least some program income as cost sharing or matching.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.

        § 1128.630   Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.

#### § § 1128.630

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:

        (1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and

        (2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.

        (b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:

        (1)  (i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.

        (ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property ( counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.

        (2)  (i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:

        (A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and

        (B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).

        (ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.

        (iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.

        (c) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the wording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, or other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.

        § 1128.635   Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.

#### § § 1128.635

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(e) through (j) and 2 CFR 200.434(b) through (g) specifies how to value and document various types of third-party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the OMB guidance described in paragraph (a) of this section as it applies to valuation and documentation of third-party in-kind contributions, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording Section VI of appendix F to this part provides as Section F of FMS Article VI.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve any paragraph of the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section F of FMS Article VI if the DoD Component determines that there will be no possibility of third-party in-kind contributions under awards using those terms and conditions.

      Subpart G-Program Income (FMS Article VII)

        § 1128.700   Purpose of FMS Article VII.

#### § § 1128.700

        FMS Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for program income that recipients earn. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.80 and 200.307.

        § 1128.705   Content of FMS Article VII.

#### § § 1128.705

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the kinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the recipient's accountability for it, and related matters.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VII the wording appendix G to this part provides, unless, as authorized by §§ 1128.710 through 1128.725, there are revisions to the wording of Sections A and E of the article or Section D is reserved.

        § 1128.710   What program income includes.

#### § § 1128.710

        (a)  Under the definition of “program income” at 2 CFR 200.80 and related OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements may include as program income:

        (1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and

        (2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.

        (b)  Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

        (c)  — (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

        (2)  If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:

        (i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

        (ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

        § 1128.715   Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.

#### § § 1128.715

        (a)  Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that recipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and royalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.

        (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.

        (2)  If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for establishing recipient obligations for the license fees and royalties described in paragraph (a) of this section, it may reserve Section D of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions.

        § 1128.720   Program income use.

#### § § 1128.720

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.

        (1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:

        (i)  A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.

        (ii)  A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.

        (iii)  Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.

        (iv)  The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.

        (2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

        (3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.

        (c)  (1)  In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:

        (i) Research awards; and

        (ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.

        (2)  A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:

        (i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: “1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”

        (ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: “If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts.”

        (3)  A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: “You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”

        (4)  A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

        § 1128.725   Program income after the period of performance.

#### § § 1128.725

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency regulations, grant or cooperative agreement terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that a recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

        (b)  A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of FMS Article VII the wording for that section that is provided in appendix G to this part. That wording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

      § 1128.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1128.1

      (a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning financial and program management, including recipients' financial management systems, payments, cost sharing or matching, program income, budget and program revisions, audits, allowable costs, and periods of availability of funds.

      (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:

      (1) Sections 200.80, 200.209, and 200.302 through 200.309;

      (2) Sections 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting; and

      (3) Subparts E and F.

      § 1128.2   Applicability of this part.

#### § § 1128.2

      The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

      § 1128.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.

#### § § 1128.3

      Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

      § 1128.4   Organization of this part.

#### § § 1128.4

      (a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

      (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

      (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

      (c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

        (a)  Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other than by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in PROP Articles II-IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.

        (b) —(1)  If a DoD Component has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either unconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II-IV and VI. This subpart refers to acquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority—and elects to use it—as “exempt property.”

        (2)  (i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property ( equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research—without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate—if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.

        (ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:

        (A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.

        (B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.

        (C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.

        (c) —(1)  Unless a DoD Component has a statute authorizing it to identify acquired property as exempt property, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, it must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article I.

        (2)  (i) If a DoD Component has statutory authority such as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and elects to use that authority for awards subject to its general terms and conditions, it must insert wording in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I to:

        (A) Identify the type or types of property it is exempting from the standard requirements for title vesting, use, and disposition contained in PROP Articles II through IV and VI and reporting requirements contained in REP Article III of the general terms and conditions.

        (B) If it is exempting the property from some, but not all, of the standard requirements, identify the requirements to which the exempt property will be subject.

        (ii) Paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I in general terms and conditions used for research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research generally should provide for vesting of title to acquired equipment and supplies in those types of entities when they are conducting basic or applied research subject only to the three conditions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

        § 1130.110   Property trust relationship.

#### § § 1130.110

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:

        (1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was acquired or improved; and

        (2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's use and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title to real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:

        (1) Must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except that a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

        (2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the wording of Section B of PROP Article I to require recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 1130.115   Title to federally owned property.

#### § § 1130.115

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government and include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I to indicate that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government; or

        (2) Reserve Section C if it provides no federally owned property under its awards.

        § 1130.120   Federal interest in donated property.

#### § § 1130.120

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Federal Government acquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the recipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in donated real property or equipment; or

        (2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market value of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.

        § 1130.125   Federal interest in property improved under awards.

#### § § 1130.125

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the Federal interest in improvements to real property or equipment that results if a recipient directly charges the costs of the improvements to an award.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in improved real property or equipment; or

        (2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

      Subpart B—Property Management System (PROP Article II)

        § 1130.200   Purpose of PROP Article II.

#### § § 1130.200

        (a) PROP Article II prescribes standards for:

        (1) Insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards;

        (2) The system that a recipient uses to manage both equipment that is acquired or improved in whole or in part under awards and federally owned property.

        (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 and 200.313(d)(1) through (4), and partially implements 2 CFR 200.313(b).

        § 1130.205   Insurance coverage for real property and equipment.

#### § § 1130.205

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 includes a requirement for recipients' insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under grants and cooperative agreements and states that federally owned property need not be insured unless required by Federal award terms and conditions.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to provide insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards. However, unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards will not require recipients to insure federally owned property.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article II; or

        (2) Reserve Section A of PROP Article II if there will be no real property or equipment acquired or improved under awards using those terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

        § 1130.210   Other property management system standards for States.

#### § § 1130.210

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the standards for States' property management systems.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article II; or

        (2) Reserve Section B of PROP Article II if no State will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be accountable for federally owned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

        § 1130.215   Other property management system standards for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

#### § § 1130.215

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the standards for property management systems of institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article II; or

        (2) Reserve Section C of PROP Article II if no institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be accountable for federally owned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

      Subpart C—Use and Disposition of Real Property (PROP Article III)

        § 1130.300   Purpose of PROP Article III.

#### § § 1130.300

        PROP Article III specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of real property acquired or improved under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) and (c).

        § 1130.305   Use of real property.

#### § § 1130.305

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) states that, except as otherwise provided by Federal statute or the Federal awarding agency, a recipient must use real property acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the recipient must not dispose of the property or encumber its title or other interests.

        (b)  Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards must permit recipients to do the following:

        (1) While real property acquired or improved under an award still is needed for the authorized purpose, also use it for other projects or programs that either are supported by DoD Components or other Federal agencies or not federally supported, as long as that use does not interfere with the property's use for the authorized purpose.

        (2) After the real property no longer is needed for the authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award administration office, use the property on other federally supported projects or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property was acquired or improved.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

        (1) Include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article III; or

        (2) If a statute or program regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies different requirements for recipients' use of real property, substitute alternative wording for Section A to specify those requirements.

        § 1130.310   Disposition of real property.

#### § § 1130.310

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c):

        (1) Addresses the recipient's responsibility to request disposition instructions for real property when the recipient no longer needs it for the originally authorized purpose; and

        (2) Identifies three alternative disposition methods those instructions may specify.

        (b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c) through award terms and conditions that govern disposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article III to specify requirements concerning disposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.

      Subpart D—Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies (PROP Article IV)

        § 1130.400   Purpose of PROP Article IV.

#### § § 1130.400

        PROP Article IV specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of equipment and supplies in which there is a Federal interest. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

        (a) 2 CFR 200.313(a) through (c), 200.313(d)(5), and 200.313(e) as that guidance applies to requirements for use and disposition of equipment; and

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(c) states that recipients of grants and cooperative agreements are subject to applicable regulations concerning patents and inventions, including Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR part 401.

        (b)  In implementing 2 CFR 200.315(c) for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, DoD:

        (1) Extends to other entities the patent rights provisions of chapter 18 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code and 37 CFR part 401 that directly apply to small business firms and nonprofit organizations. This broadened applicability is in accordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in Executive Order 12591, “Facilitating Access to Science and Technology.”

        (2) Establishes a requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their awards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.

        (3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by recipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.

        (c)  (1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government must include the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI, with one permitted exception.

        (ii) Substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” to provide an additional 30 days for recipient's submissions of final reports after the end date of the period of performance; or

        (iii) Include a requirement for recipients to submit information about each patent application they submit for a subject invention, interim listings of all subject inventions, or both, which the Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR 401.5(f)(2) and (3) permit agencies to require.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards to support scholarships or fellowships, training grants, or other awards for primarily educational purposes must replace the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI with an alternative award provision stating that the Federal Government will have no rights to inventions made by recipients.

        (3) A A DoD Component developing general terms and conditions for awards other than those described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section should:

        (i) Consult its intellectual property counsel if it anticipates that recipients may develop patentable inventions under its awards, to identify any applicable statutes or regulations and determine an appropriate substitute for the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI; or

        (ii) Reserve Section B of PROP Article VI if it does not expect development of any patentable inventions under those awards.

        (a) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.323, 200.324(a) and (b), and 200.325;

        (b) Partially implements 2 CFR 200.205(d) and 200.213; and

        (c) Implements, in conjunction with PROC Article III, 2 CFR 200.326.

        § 1132.205   Procurement procedures.

#### § § 1132.205

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for procurement systems of institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

        (b)  In order to implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B provides for Sections A through F of PROC Article II.

        § 1132.210   Procurement of recovered materials.

#### § § 1132.210

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for procurement of recovered materials if State agencies or agencies of a political subdivision of a State may receive awards using those terms and conditions or be subrecipients under those awards.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

        (1) Use the wording that appendix B provides for Section G of PROC Article II, to specify requirements for a local government or other political subdivision of a State to comply with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requirements; or

        (2) Reserve Section G if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that a political subdivision of a State will receive either:

        (i) An award using those terms and conditions; or

        (ii) A subaward under an award using those terms and conditions.

        § 1132.215   Review of recipient procurement documents.

#### § § 1132.215

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must:

        (1) Include a requirement for recipients to make technical specifications for proposed procurements available upon the DoD Component's request, as described in 2 CFR 200.324(a).

        (2) Reserve the DoD Component's right to review a recipient's pre-procurement documents when any of the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.324(b)(1) through (5) apply and the recipient is not exempted from the requirement in accordance with 2 CFR 200.324(c).

        (b)  To implement the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B to this part provides for Section H of PROC Article II.

        § 1132.220   Bonding requirements.

#### § § 1132.220

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require each recipient to meet minimum bonding requirements if it awards any construction or facility improvement contract with a value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. A recipient would instead use its own bonding requirements if the DoD Component determined that the recipient's bonding policy and requirements are adequate to protect Federal interests.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B to this part provides for Section I of PROC Article II. The DoD Component may include a provision in the award-specific terms and conditions to override Section I of PROC Article II in each award to a recipient for which it made the determination about the recipient's bonding policy and requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve Section I if the DoD Component determines that there will be no construction or facility improvement contracts with values in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold under awards using its general terms and conditions.

      Subpart C—Contract Provisions for Recipient Procurements (PROC Article III)

        § 1132.300   Purpose of PROC Article III.

#### § § 1132.300

        PROC Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies provisions that recipients must include in contracts under their awards, as applicable. It thereby:

        (a) Implements, in conjunction with PROC Articles I and II, OMB guidance concerning recipients' contract provisions under grants and cooperative agreements in 2 CFR 200.317 and 200.326;

        (b) Partially implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(d) and 200.213 concerning suspension and debarment requirements; and

        (c) Partially implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.517 concerning retention and access of auditors' records.

        § 1132.305   Administrative requirements.

#### § § 1132.305

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include in their contracts standard administrative requirements related to remedies, termination, allowable costs, rights in copyrights and data, records access and retention, and reporting.

        (b)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROC Article III.

        § 1132.310   National policy requirements.

#### § § 1132.310

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include provisions in their contracts that require the contractors to comply with applicable national policy requirements.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix C to this part provides for Section B of PROC Article III.

        (2)  (i) The Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) does not apply to a program carried out through grants or cooperative agreements unless another statute makes it apply to that program. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore may not include the provision that appendix C to this part includes as paragraph B.2 of PROC Article III unless another statute makes the Wage Rate Requirements statute apply to the program using those general terms and conditions.

        (ii) If a DoD Component determines that any of the other national policy requirements in Section B will not apply to any of the awards subject to its general terms and conditions, the DoD Component may reserve the paragraphs of Section B addressing those requirements. Should a future need arise to include the requirements in a given award, the DoD Component may include them as award-specific terms and conditions.

      § 1132.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1132.1

      (a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' purchases of property (supplies, equipment, and real property) and services.

      (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.326, and appendix II to 2 CFR part 200, as those portions of 2 CFR part 200 apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.205(d), 200.213, and 200.517.

      § 1132.2   Applicability of this part.

#### § § 1132.2

      The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

      § 1132.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.

#### § § 1132.3

      Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as follows:

      (a) As described in 2 CFR 1126.3, and

      (b) Based on any language in 2 CFR 200.110(a) regarding the applicability of the procurement standards in 2 CFR part 200.

      § 1132.4   Organization of this part.

#### § § 1132.4

      (a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

      (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

      (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

      (c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through C to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through C, respectively):

    PART 1134—FINANCIAL, PROGRAMMATIC, AND PROPERTY REPORTING: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Part 1134

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51171, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Performance Management, Monitoring, and Reporting (REP Article I)

        § 1134.100   Purpose of REP Article I.

#### § § 1134.100

        REP Article I of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to recipient reporting on program performance. It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in:

        (a) 2 CFR 200.328; and

        (b) Portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that relate to performance reporting.

        § 1134.105   Performance reporting for construction awards.

#### § § 1134.105

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(c) notes that agencies rely heavily on onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under construction grants and cooperative agreements and states that agencies may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.

        (b)  DoD Components may require performance reports under construction awards only when necessary and, to reduce recipient burdens, should coordinate the performance reporting with financial reporting to the maximum extent practicable.

        (c)  (1) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and does not need performance reports for those awards, it:

        (i) Should reserve Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions;

        (ii) Must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 and 1134.145 to include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Sections E and G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, in order to require recipients to promptly report significant developments and reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits.

        (iii) Must follow the specifications in § 1134.140 to insert wording in Section F of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, to tell recipients where and how to submit any reports of significant developments.

        (2) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and determines that it needs performance reports for those awards:

        (i) It may tailor the template and content that appendix A to this part provides for Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as needed to specify the reporting requirements or, as appropriate, instead integrate those requirements into REP Article II on financial reporting. The form, format, or data elements that the DoD Component specifies for any of those performance reports must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320, to use OMB-approved information collections if more than 9 recipients will be subject to the reporting requirement.

        (ii) It must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 through 1134.145 concerning Sections E through G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

        § 1134.110   Performance reporting for non-construction awards.

#### § § 1134.110

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report that it does not need.

        (b) —(1)  DoD Components should waive requirements for interim performance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers have an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program oversight during the period of performance.

        (2) —(i)  DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under research awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary purpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve as a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, and conclusions or recommendations of the research.

        (ii)  DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final performance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving requirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.

        (c)  Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms and conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. A DoD Component must either use the wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, in accordance with §§ 1134.115 through 1134.145, to:

        (1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance reporting (see § 1134.115);

        (2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see § 1134.120);

        (3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see § 1134.125);

        (4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see § 1134.130);

        (5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see § 1134.135);

        (6) Specify reporting procedures (see § 1134.140); and

        (7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see § 1134.145).

        § 1134.115   Content and forms, formats, or data elements for interim and final performance reporting under non-construction awards.

#### § § 1134.115

        (a)  OMB guidance in:

        (1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328(b)(2) state that Federal awarding agencies must require recipients to use standard OMB-approved information collections for reporting performance information.

        (2) 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) list types of information that performance reports under non-construction grants and cooperative agreements will contain, as appropriate, unless other collections are approved by OMB.

        (b)  (1) The content of the information collections that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for non-construction awards must include the elements listed in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) that are appropriate to the projects or programs subject to those general terms and conditions.

        (2) Forms, formats, and data elements that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for performance reporting under non-construction awards must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 to use OMB-approved information collections, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

        (3) To the maximum extent practicable, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that recipients use Governmentwide standard forms, formats, and data elements that also are used by other Federal agencies for similar programs, recipients, and types of awards ( the Research Performance Progress Report format or any successor to it that OMB clears for interim performance progress reports under research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations).

        (c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section A of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify the form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for interim and final performance reports. Section A of REP Article I may specify a different requirement for final performance reports than interim reports.

        § 1134.120   Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.

#### § § 1134.120

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) addresses performance reporting frequency under grants and cooperative agreements and due dates.

        (1)  The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent than annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances ( when more frequent reporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).

        (2)  The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:

        (i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; and

        (ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the agency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.

        (b)  DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and due dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and added specifications concerning reporting periods:

        (1)  DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.

        (2)  For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim performance reports on a cumulative basis— the second and any subsequent performance report should address only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier interim performance reports.

        (3)  If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual circumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component must specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim reports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c)  A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:

        (1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;

        (2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and

        (3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the reporting period.

        § 1134.125   Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.

#### § § 1134.125

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due date if a recipient submits a justified request.

        (b) —(1)  Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):

        (i)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:

        (A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.

        (B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.

        (ii)  A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.

        (2) —(i)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.

        (ii)  Final reports for research awards must be cumulative ( each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).

        (c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:

        (1) Must either:

        (i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is either 90 or 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance, as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(i), by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only the number of days ( 90 or 120 calendar days) appropriate for the type of awards; or

        (ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the 90 calendar day due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for non-construction awards other than research, by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only “120 calendar days” in lieu of “90 calendar days.”

        (2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for final reports ( that research awards require cumulative final reports).

        § 1134.130   Requesting extensions of due dates for performance reports.

#### § § 1134.130

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that, if a recipient submits a justified request for an extension in the due date for any interim or final performance report under a grant or cooperative agreement, an agency may extend the due date.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that a recipient may request an extension of the due date for interim or final performance reports. DoD Components should grant requests that provide adequate justification. For a DoD Component that pre-approves a 30-day extension of due dates for final performance reports in its general terms and conditions, as described in § 1134.125(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii), any award-specific extensions would be beyond the pre-approved 30-day extension.

        (c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section D of REP Article I on extensions of performance reporting due dates.

        § 1134.135   Reporting significant developments.

#### § § 1134.135

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(d) states that a recipient must promptly notify the awarding agency about significant developments under grants and cooperative agreements.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to report significant developments, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(d).

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section E of REP Article I on reporting of significant developments.

        § 1134.140   Performance reporting procedures.

#### § § 1134.140

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients about performance reporting procedures.

        (b)  To implement the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions must insert wording in Section F of REP Article I (which is reserved in the template for REP Article I that appendix A to this part provides), to specify:

        (1) The office or offices to which a recipient must submit its interim and final performance reports, any requests in due dates for those reports, and any reports of significant developments; and

        (2) How the recipient is to submit those reports and requests ( email or other electronic submission method).

        (3) For research awards, component must assure that the recipient final report complies with the distribution and marking requirements of DoD Manual 3200.14, Volume 1. This includes the requirement that all significant scientific or technological findings, recommendations, and results derived from DoD endeavors—which shall include the final performance report at a minimum—are recorded and provided to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Follow guidance in (b)(1) to inform recipients as the submission and distribution requirements ( Component may choose to receive the report and submit to DTIC themselves or provide instructions to recipient on submission to DTIC).

        (4) Access to Research Results

        (i) For purposes of this term and condition, the following definition applies:

        The final version of a peer-reviewed article for a professional journal publication disclosing the results of scientific research which is authored or co-authored by the recipient or funded, in whole or in part, with funds from a DoD award, that includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article.

        (ii) The recipient shall ensure that any Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) repository, currently at  Ensure that the Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted when it is accepted for publication, and when the final title and date of publication are known.

        § 1134.145   Site visits.

#### § § 1134.145

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(e) states that a Federal awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must state that the Federal Government reserves the right to make site visits as warranted.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section G of REP Article I concerning site visits.

      Subpart B—Financial Reporting (REP Article II)

        § 1134.200   Purpose of REP Article II.

#### § § 1134.200

        REP Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to financial reporting. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 and the portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that are specific to financial reporting under grants and cooperative agreements.

        § 1134.205   Reporting forms, formats, or data elements.

#### § § 1134.205

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 states that Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to use only the standard OMB-approved Governmentwide data elements for collection of financial information, unless OMB approves other forms, formats, or data elements for financial information collection.

        (b)  DoD Components must collect financial information from recipients using OMB-approved forms, formats, or data elements.

        (1) Unless current approvals expire, approved financial information collections include the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) and Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270). In the future, they would include any additional information collections that OMB approves.

        (2) For all but the recipient's final financial report, a DoD Component may rely on financial information the recipient provides on the SF-270 or other OMB-approved payment request form, format, or data elements if that financial information is sufficient to meet the DoD Component's needs. For the final report, the DoD Component must require the recipient to use the SF-425 or other OMB-approved financial information collection.

        (3) A DoD Component must obtain approval for any variations from OMB-approved forms or formats, including use of additional or substitute data elements or modification of the associated instructions for recipient entities submitting the information.

        § 1134.210   Content of REP Article II.

#### § § 1134.210

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify what financial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.

        (b) —(1)  Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial reporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days after the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.

        (2)  In Section A of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-approved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the website where they can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports during the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed on the final report.

        (3)  In Section B of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which recipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it is due. However, this section of the article may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information already provided with payment requests ( on the SF-270).

        (i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances ( a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).

        (ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.

        (iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules—which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards—the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.

        (4)  Appendix B to this part provides wording for Section C of REP Article II to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 provides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to recipients, the wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-award administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any information they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the wording or supplement it if the DoD Component has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.

        (5)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording for Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim or final financial reports.

        (6)  In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must submit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so ( email or other electronic submission method).

      Subpart C—Reporting on Property (REP Article III)

        § 1134.300   Purposes of REP Article III.

#### § § 1134.300

        REP Article III of the general terms and conditions provides a consolidated source that sets out required reports, notifications, requests, and accountings related to federally owned property and property that is acquired or improved under awards. The article is:

        (a) The original source of requirements for recipients to:

        (1) Submit periodic status reports and notifications of critical changes for real property (in paragraphs A.1 and A.2 of the article), which thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329;

        (2) Submit an annual inventory of federally owned property (in paragraph C.1 of the article), which thereby partially implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a);

        (3) Provide information on request about copyrighted works and data produced under awards (in paragraph D.2 of the article).

        (b) A secondary source provided for the convenience of recipients and DoD post-award administrators that lists and refers to the original sources of requirements for recipients to:

        (1) Request disposition instructions and account at closeout for real property (in paragraphs A.3 and A.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Article III and OAR Article VI;

        (2) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for equipment (in paragraphs B.2 and B.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and IV, respectively;

        (3) Account at closeout for equipment and supplies (in paragraph B.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in OAR Article VI and PROP Article IV;

        (4) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for federally owned property (in paragraphs C.2 and C.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and V, respectively;

        (5) Disclose and report on inventions developed under awards (in paragraph D.1), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI; and

        (6) Request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards (in paragraph D.3 of the article), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI.

        § 1134.305   Real property: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

#### § § 1134.305

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the real property reporting requirements described in § 1134.300(a)(1) and provide references to the related requirements described in § 1134.300(b)(1).

        (b)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the wording of Section A of REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

        (1)  Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:

        (i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic status reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real property). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which provides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real property.

        (ii) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.b to specify the due date for each periodic status report in terms of the number of calendar days after the end of the period covered by the report ( a report on the status of the property as of September 30 might be due 30 calendar days after that date).

        (iii) May provide wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.c if there are other instructions— a form, format, or information elements that a recipient must use (which must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320) or a particular office to which reports must be submitted, especially if reporting will continue beyond closeout of the award under which the real property was acquired or improved.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section A of REP Article III if it determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions.

        § 1134.310   Equipment and supplies: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

#### § § 1134.310

        (a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that there is no requirement for routine periodic reporting about equipment acquired under an award and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(2) and (3) to requirements in other articles for notifications, requests, and accounting related to equipment and supplies.

        (b)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of REP Article III.

        § 1134.315   Federally owned property: inventory, notifications, and requests.

#### § § 1134.315

        (a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(4) to requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:

        (i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or

        (ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

        (2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.

        (c) —(1)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data elements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.

        § 1134.320   Intangible property: disclosures, reports, and requests.

#### § § 1134.320

        (a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(3) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(5) and (6) to requirements in other articles for disclosures, reports, and requests related to intangible property.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of REP Article III.

        (2)  A DoD Component may reserve:

        (i) Section D of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will have any intangible property for which they will be accountable to the Federal Government; or

        (ii) Any of paragraphs D.1 through D.3, if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable to the Federal Government for the particular types of intangible property addressed by those paragraphs.

      Subpart D—Reporting on Subawards and Executive Compensation (REP Article IV)

        § 1134.400   Purpose of REP Article IV.

#### § § 1134.400

        REP Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation.

        § 1134.405   Content of REP Article IV.

#### § § 1134.405

        (a)  The requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation originate in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended (31 U.S.C. 6101 note). OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 170 implements those statutory requirements and appendix A to that part provides standard Governmentwide wording of an award provision.

        (b)  To implement the reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides as REP Article IV.

      Subpart E—Other Reporting (REP Article V)

        § 1134.500   Purpose of REP Article V.

#### § § 1134.500

        REP Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to provide any type of report not addressed in REP Articles I-IV.

        § 1134.505   Content of REP Article V.

#### § § 1134.505

        (a)  Any requirement in a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for recipients to provide a type of report not addressed in REP Articles I-IV must:

        (1) Have a basis in a statute or regulation adopted in the  after an opportunity for public comment; and

        (2) Use a form/format that has been approved by OMB under the PRA, as implemented by OMB in 5 CFR part 1320.

        (b)  (1) To implement any reporting requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following content in REP Article V, consistent with the PRA approval. Otherwise, REP Article V must be reserved.

        (a) The name of the report and where a recipient can obtain it;

        (b) For an interim report, the frequency with which it must be submitted and due date(s);

        (c) For a final report, whether the report is due 90 days or, if the DoD Component has pre-approved a 30-day extension, 120 days after the end of the period of performance; and

        (d) To what DoD office/official the report(s) must be submitted.

        (2) If there is more than one such report, the DoD Component must show the information for each in separate sections of the article.

      § 1134.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1134.1

      (a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' reporting requirements.

      (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance on reporting in 2 CFR part 170 and the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they relate to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:

      (1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.327 through 200.329; and

      (2) 2 CFR 200.300(b) as it relates to subaward reporting, 200.312(a) as it relates to inventories of federally owned property, and 200.343(a) as it relates to financial and performance reporting.

      § 1134.2   Applicability of this part.

#### § § 1134.2

      The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

      § 1134.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.

#### § § 1134.3

      Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

      § 1134.4   Organization of this part.

#### § § 1134.4

      (a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

      (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

      (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

      (c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through D to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through D, respectively):

    PART 1136—OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Part 1136

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 51171, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information (OAR Article I)

        § 1136.100   Purpose of OAR Article I.

#### § § 1136.100

        OAR Article I sets forth requirements for recipients to maintain current information about themselves in the data system the Federal Government specifies as the repository for standard information about its business partners, currently the System for Award Management. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in:

        (a) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);

        (b) 2 CFR part 25; and

        (c) The portion of 2 CFR 200.300(b) that cites 2 CFR part 25 and the System for Award Management).

        § 1136.105   Content of OAR Article I.

#### § § 1136.105

        To implement the requirement described in § 1136.100, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the standard wording appendix A to this part provides as OAR Article I. A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the article in its general terms and conditions if it is certain that there will be no award using those general terms and conditions for which the Federal share of the award's total value will exceed $500,000.

      Subpart B—Records Retention and Access (OAR Article II)

        § 1136.200   Purpose of OAR Article II.

#### § § 1136.200

        OAR Article II addresses rights and responsibilities concerning retention of records related to awards; access to recipients' records; and collection, transmission, and storage of information. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.337.

        § 1136.205   Records retention period.

#### § § 1136.205

        (a)  OMB guidance in:

        (1) The lead-in paragraph of 2 CFR 200.333 sets a standard retention period that is generally applicable to recipient records pertinent to grants and cooperative agreements.

        (2) 2 CFR 200.333(c) and (f) provide different standard retention periods specifically for records that are related either to real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the standard retention periods described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of OAR Article II.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may substitute alternative wording for paragraph A.3 of OAR Article II if the awards using those terms and conditions will be renewed quarterly or annually. The alternative wording for awards that will be renewed quarterly or annually would replace the words “final financial report” in paragraph A.3 with “quarterly financial report” or “annual financial report,” respectively.

        § 1136.210   Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.

#### § § 1136.210

        (a)  OMB guidance in:

        (1) 2 CFR 200.333(a) provides for an extended retention period for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period.

        (2) 2 CFR 200.333(b) provides that a recipient also is required to extend the retention period when a Federal awarding, cognizant, or oversight agency notifies it in writing to do so.

        (b)  (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended retention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).

        (2)(i) Other than the exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require recipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).

        (ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the “retention period,” as that term is used in 2 CFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends beyond the standard 3-year retention period described in § 1136.205. That extension will enable disallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to retain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. Without that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which states that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient within the record retention period.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of OAR Article II.

        § 1136.215   Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.

#### § § 1136.215

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333(e) provides the retention period for records related to program income earned under a grant or cooperative agreement after the end of the period of performance, if an agency establishes requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after that time.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions should not establish retention requirements for records related to program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Retention requirements for those records in general terms and conditions would be inconsistent with the statement in 2 CFR 1128.725 that a DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Section 1128.725 provides for use of general terms and conditions wording in FMS Article VII that establishes no such requirement. Section 1128.725 further states that exceptions for individual awards are properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of OAR Article II. If a DoD Component includes a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance, it also may include a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient's retention of the associated records.

        § 1136.220   Records for joint or long-term use.

#### § § 1136.220

        (a)  OMB guidance in:

        (1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its custody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that the agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.

        (2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention requirement.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that they may be asked to transfer records, maintain them for joint use, or retain them for a longer period.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section D of OAR Article II.

        § 1136.225   Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.

#### § § 1136.225

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 addresses the use of electronic and paper formats in the collection, transmission, and storage of information related to awards.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include provisions consistent with the guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 for recipients' use of electronic and paper formats to collect, transmit, and store information.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section E of OAR Article II.

        § 1136.230   Access to records.

#### § § 1136.230

        (a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.336 and 200.337 addresses Federal Government and public access to recipient records related to grants and cooperative agreements.

        (b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for Federal Government access to records consistent with 2 CFR 200.336 and address public access to records to implement the guidance in 2 CFR 200.337.

        (c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section F of OAR Article II.

      Subpart C—Remedies and Termination (OAR Article III)

        § 1136.300   Purpose of OAR Article III.

#### § § 1136.300

        OAR Article III addresses remedies for noncompliance, including suspension and termination of awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 through 200.340 and 200.342.

        § 1136.305   Content of OAR Article III.

#### § § 1136.305

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify remedies available for addressing noncompliance with award terms and conditions, policies and procedures related to termination of awards, and effects of suspension and termination on allowability of costs.

        (b)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for OAR Article III.

      Subpart D—Claims, Disputes, and Appeals (OAR Article IV)

        § 1136.400   Purpose of OAR Article IV.

#### § § 1136.400

        OAR Article IV addresses claims, disputes, and appeals under awards. It thereby provides the award terms and conditions required by the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 and also implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.341.

        § 1136.405   Content of OAR Article IV.

#### § § 1136.405

        (a)  The DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 require DoD Components' general terms and conditions to incorporate the procedures set forth in that section for processing claims and disputes and deciding appeals of grants officer's decisions.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV, with wording inserted in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2 to identify the Component's cognizant Grant Appeal Authority and provide his or her mailing or email address.

        (2)  A DoD Component may add one or more sections to the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV to state a requirement that recipients must provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters if:

        (i) That requirement is in a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment; and

        (ii) The statutory or regulatory requirement applies to awards using the DoD Component's general terms and conditions.

      Subpart E—Collection of Amounts Due (OAR Article V)

        § 1136.500   Purpose of OAR Article V.

#### § § 1136.500

        OAR Article V addresses procedures for establishing, appealing, and collecting debts under DoD awards. It thereby:

        (a) Provides requirements for recipients paralleling those for DoD Components in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.820;

        (b) Augments requirements of OAR Article IV in any case in which a claim leads to a determination that a recipient owes an amount to DoD; and

        (c) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.345.

        § 1136.505   Content of OAR Article V.

#### § § 1136.505

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how grants officers' decisions establish debts under awards, when debts become delinquent, how and when recipients may appeal, and how debts not paid in a timely manner are referred for debt collection.

        (b)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides for OAR Article V.

      Subpart F—Closeout (OAR Article VI)

        § 1136.600   Purpose of OAR Article VI.

#### § § 1136.600

        OAR Article VI addresses recipients' responsibilities for closeout of awards and subawards under them. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343.

        § 1136.605   Content of OAR Article VI.

#### § § 1136.605

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to closeout of awards and subawards, including recipients' liquidations of obligations, refunds of unobligated balances, and submission of final reports.

        (b) —(1)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for OAR Article VI.

        (2)  Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a), a DoD Component may grant extensions to due dates for final reports.

        (i) To pre-approve a 30-day extension for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports, a DoD Component may substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” in the wording appendix F to this part provides for paragraph C.4 of OAR Article VI. These pre-approved 30-day extensions in the general terms and conditions are for all awards using those terms and conditions; they therefore are separate and distinct from any additional extensions a recipient may later request for an individual award.

        (ii) The parallel authorities for pre-approved extensions of due dates for final performance and invention reports are elsewhere. DoDGARs provisions in:

        (A) 2 CFR 1134.125 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of performance reports by an appropriate substitution of wording in REP Article I of the general terms and conditions.

        (B) 2 CFR 1130.610 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of final reports listing subject inventions under awards by an appropriate substitution of wording in PROP Article VI of the general terms and conditions.

        (C) 2 CFR 1134.505 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of other types of final reports by inclusion of appropriate wording in REP Article V of the general terms and conditions.

#### § § 1136.705

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients with respect to funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after award closeout.

        (b)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix G to this part provides for OAR Article VII.

      § 1136.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1136.1

      (a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning submission and maintenance of recipient information; records retention and access; remedies for noncompliance and termination; claims, disputes, and appeals; collection of amounts due; closeout; and after-the-award requirements.

      (b) It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in multiple portions of 2 CFR part 200, as those portions apply to general terms and conditions. Specifically, this part implements:

      (1) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);

      (2) 2 CFR 200.300(b) as it refers to requirements in 2 CFR part 25; and

      (3) 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.345.

      § 1136.2   Applicability of this part.

#### § § 1136.2

      The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

      § 1136.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.

#### § § 1136.3

      Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

      § 1136.4   Organization of this part.

#### § § 1136.4

      (a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

      (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

      (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

      (c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

        (2)  If a DoD Component has the necessary statutory authority to do so and includes provisions in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I to identify any property acquired under the award as exempt property, as described in 2 CFR 1130.105, the DoD Component may at its option insert wording in paragraph B.1.b of SUB Article V to allow recipients to pass through those provisions to subrecipients.

        (i) It is critical, however, that the DoD Component ensures that the wording of paragraph B.1.b is consistent with the statutory authority.

        (ii) For example, if the statutory authority is 31 U.S.C. 6306—as described in 2 CFR 1130.105(b)(2)(i)—the wording of paragraph B.1.b of SUB Article V may permit a recipient to flow down the substance of the exempt property provision in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I only to a subrecipient that is a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research.

        (2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add one or more sections to the wording that appendix H to this part provides for SUB Article VIII if the DoD Component added requirements to OAR Article IV of its general terms and conditions, in accordance with paragraph 2 CFR 1136.405(b)(2), because a statute or regulation requires recipients to provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters. The additional wording in SUB Article VIII would address the flow down to subrecipients of the added requirements in OAR Article IV.

#### § § 1138.1100

        SUB Article XI specifies requirements that a recipient must include in any subaward under which it judges that the subrecipient may make lower-tier subawards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a) through (c) and other portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to lower-tier subawards.

        § 1138.1105   Content of SUB Article XI.

#### § § 1138.1105

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements that recipients must include in subawards to entities that may make lower-tier subawards.

        § 1138.1205   Content of SUB Article XII.

#### § § 1138.1205

        (a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a fixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements the recipient must include in those subawards.

        (b)  — (1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII.

        (2)

        (i) In addition to the authorities provided in § 1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add wording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the Component's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the program or programs that use its general terms and conditions.

        (ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix L provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, well-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being reimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.

      § 1138.1   Purpose of this part.

#### § § 1138.1

      (a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' award and administration of subawards under DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

#### § § 1138.3

      Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

      § 1138.4   Organization of this part.

#### § § 1138.4

      (a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

      (1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

      (2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

      (b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart and the authorization in § 1138.5, which permit a DoD Component to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

      (c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through L to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through L, respectively, as supplemented by the authorization in § 1138.5):

      § 1138.5   Authority to omit or reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII.

#### § § 1138.5

      A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

      (a) Omit SUB Articles II through XII that are the subject of this part if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to make subawards under awards using those terms and conditions. The DoD Component also may amend SUB Article I in that case, to state the prohibition on making subawards and limit the recipient's responsibility to ensuring that any transaction it awards at the next tier is a procurement transaction.

      (b) Reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII that do not apply to the DoD Component's awards using those terms and conditions.
