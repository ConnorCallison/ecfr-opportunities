Neither program is an entitlement program and payments will only be made to the extent that the Deputy Administrator announces the eligibility of benefits for certain natural disasters, the areas in which such benefits will be available, the time period in which the disaster and the rehabilitation must occur, and only so long as all the conditions for eligibility specified in this part and elsewhere in law are met. However, the Deputy Administrator will not apply any non-statutory limitation on payments provided for in this part in such a way that it would necessarily result in the non-expenditure of program funds required to otherwise be made by law.\n",

Except as otherwise provided in this rule, discretionary determinations to be made under this rule will be made by the Deputy Administrator. Matters committed to the discretion of the Deputy Administrator shall be considered in all cases to be permissive powers and no person or legal entity shall, under any circumstances, be considered to be entitled to an exercise of such power in their favor. \n",

If the requirement for technical assistance results in undue delay or significant hardship to producers in a county, the State committee may request in writing that FSA waive this requirement for that county. However, nothing in this paragraph or in this part creates a right of appeal or action for an applicant with respect to provisions relating to internal procedures of FSA.\n",

For quantity losses, producers need to apply a standard similar to the historic yield provisions used under previous ad hoc disaster programs. Those provisions provided that a historic yield was the higher of a county average yield or a producer's approved yield. Thus, if an applicant is determining whether a farm has a crop that suffered a loss of five percent or greater on the farm's planted and considered planted acreage, the applicant could compare the amount successfully produced in 2009 from those planted and considered planted acres to what the participant expected to produce from that acreage using either the county average yield (which may be obtained from FSA by request) or based on analysis of approved actual production history yields that may exist for producers of the crop on the farm.\n",

If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a producer to directly receive a CAP payment, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For CAP, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this title, the AGI amount will be that person's or legal entity's average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the 2008 taxable year (that is 2005, 2006, and 2007).\n",

The use of payment factors is based on whether the crop acreage was unharvested or prevented planted, not whether a participant actually incurs or does not incur expenses. Payment factors are generally applicable to all similarly situated participants and are not established in response to individual participants.

                      "(a) Producers must report all crops that suffered a revenue loss in whole or in part due to a qualifying disaster event on form FSA-522, Crop Insurance and/or NAP Coverage Agreement.\n",
                      "(b) All producers who receive ERP Phase 2 payments must file an accurate acreage report and purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage where crop insurance is not available, for the next 2 available crop years. For each crop reported according to paragraph (a) of this section, participants must obtain crop insurance or NAP, as may be applicable:\n",
                      "(1) At a coverage level equal to or greater than 60 percent for insurable crops; or\n",
                      "(2) At the catastrophic level or higher for NAP crops.\n",
                      "(c) Availability will be determined from the date a producer receives an ERP payment and may vary depending on the timing and availability of crop insurance or NAP for a producer's particular crops. The final crop year to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage to meet the second year of coverage for this requirement is the 2026 crop year.\n",
                      "(d) In situations where crop insurance is unavailable for a crop, an ERP participant must obtain NAP coverage. Section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 (1985 Farm Bill) provides that a person or entity with an AGI greater than $900,000 is not eligible to participate in NAP; however, producers with an AGI greater than $900,000 are eligible for ERP. To reconcile this restriction in the 1985 Farm Bill and the requirement to obtain NAP or crop insurance coverage, ERP participants may meet the purchase requirement by purchasing Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) crop insurance coverage, if eligible, or they may pay the applicable NAP service fee despite their ineligibility for a NAP payment. In other words, the service fee must be paid even though no NAP payment may be made because the AGI of the person or entity exceeds the 1985 Farm Bill limitation.\n",
                      "(e) If both Federal crop insurance and NAP coverage are unavailable for a crop, the producer must obtain WFRP crop insurance coverage, if eligible.\n",
                      "(f) For all crops listed on form FSA-522, producers who have the crop or crop acreage in subsequent years and who fail to obtain the 2 years of crop insurance or NAP coverage required as required by this section, must refund the ERP Phase 2 payment with interest from the date of disbursement. Producers who do not plant a crop listed on form FSA-522 in a year for which this requirement applies are not subject to the crop insurance or NAP purchase requirement for that year.\n",
                      "(g) Producers who received an ERP Phase 1 payment for a crop are not required to obtain additional years of crop insurance or NAP coverage for that crop if they also receive an ERP Phase 2 payment for a loss associated with that crop.\n\n\n\n\n"

Under no circumstances may crops or livestock, other than breeding livestock, be the only security for a loan to be rescheduled using a balloon payment. If a balloon payment is used, the projected value of the security must indicate that the loan will be fully secured when the balloon payment becomes due. The projected value will be derived from a current appraisal adjusted for depreciation of depreciable property, such as buildings and other improvements, that occurs until the balloon payment is due. For other security, a current appraisal is required. The lender is required to project the security value at the time the balloon payment is due based on the remaining life of the security, or the depreciation schedule on the borrower's Federal income tax return. Loans restructured with a balloon payment that are secured by real estate will have a minimum term of 5 years, and other loans will have a minimum term of 3 years before the scheduled balloon payment. If statutory limits on terms of loans prevent the minimum terms, balloon payments may not be used. If the loan is rescheduled with unequal installments, a feasible plan, as defined in § 762.2(b), must be projected for when installments are scheduled to increase.\n",
                  "(5) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make a payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted prior to the payment coming due.\n",
                  "(6) The lender may capitalize the outstanding interest when restructuring the loan as follows:\n",
                  "(i) As a result of the capitalization of interest, a rescheduled promissory note may increase the amount of principal the borrower is required to pay. However, in no case will such principal amount exceed the statutory loan limits contained in § 761.8 of this chapter.\n",
                  "(ii) When accrued interest causes the loan amount to exceed the statutory loan limits, rescheduling may be approved without capitalization of the amount that exceeds the limit. Noncapitalized interest may be scheduled for repayment over the term of the rescheduled note.\n",
                  "(iii) Only interest that has accrued at the rate indicated on the borrower's original promissory notes may be capitalized. Late payment fees or default interest penalties that have accrued due to the borrower's failure to make payments as agreed are not covered under the guarantee and may not be capitalized.\n",
                  "(iv) The Agency will execute a modification of guarantee form to identify the new loan principal and the guaranteed portion if greater than the original loan amounts, and to waive the restriction on capitalization of interest, if applicable, to the existing guarantee documents. The modification form will be attached to the original guarantee as an addendum.\n",
                  "(v) Approved capitalized interest will be treated as part of the principal and interest that accrues thereon, in the event that a loss should occur.\n",
                  "(7) The lender's security position will not be adversely affected because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken if needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to be restructured, unless it is restructured with a balloon payment. When a loan is restructured using a balloon payment the lender must project the loan to be fully secured at the time the balloon payment becomes due, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.\n",
                  "(8) Any holder agrees to any changes in the original loan terms. If the holder does not agree, the lender must repurchase the loan from the holder for any loan restructuring to occur.\n",

FSA county committees will determine production losses that are not caused by the disaster associated with the natural disaster declaration. The calculated production loss determined in § 786.106(d) will be adjusted to account for pounds of production losses determined by the FSA county committee to not have been associated with the declared natural disaster for an eligible disaster county. The FSA county committee may convert cow numbers to actual pounds of production used in the adjustment, by multiplying the average annual production per cow determined from base period information, by the applicable number of cows determined to be ineligible to generate claims for benefits.
