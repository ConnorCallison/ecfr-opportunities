#### § § 301.13

    The State plan consists of records furnished by the State to cover its Child Support Enforcement program under title IV-D of the Act. After approval of the original plan by the Office, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that the Office may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.

    (a)  State plans and revisions of the plans are submitted first to the State governor or his designee for review in accordance with § 301.12, and then to the regional office. The States are encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when a plan is in process of preparation or revision.

    (b)  The Office of Child Support Enforcement in the regional offices is responsible for review of State plans and amendments. It also initiates discussion with the IV-D agency on clarification of significant aspects of the plan which come to its attention in the course of this review. State plan material on which the regional staff has questions concerning the application of Federal policy is referred with recommendations as required to the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the central office for technical assistance. Comments and suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in negotiations with the IV-D agency.

    (c)  The Regional Office exercises delegated authority to take affirmative action on the State plan and amendments thereto on the basis of policy statements or precedents previously approved by the Director. The Director retains authority for determining that proposed plan material is not approvable, or that a previously approved plan no longer meets the requirements for approval, except that a final determination of disapproval may not be made without prior consultation and discussion by the Director with the Secretary. The Regional Office or the Director formally notifies the IV-D agency of the actions taken on the State plan or revisions thereto.

    (d)  Determinations as to whether the State plan (including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plan) originally meets or continues to meet the requirements for approval are based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations. Guidelines are furnished to assist in the interpretation of the regulations.

Within 30 days after receipt of such a petition, the Director shall notify the State of the time and place at which the hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be held. Such hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, unless the Director and the State agree in writing on another time. The hearing procedures contained in 45 CFR part 213 applicable to § 201.4 of this title shall apply to reconsiderations brought under this section. A determination affirming, modifying, or reversing the Director's original decision will be made within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. Action pursuant to an initial determination by the Director described in such § 301.1 (e) or (f) that a plan or amendment is not approvable shall not be stayed pending the reconsideration, but in the event that the Director subsequently determines that his original decision was incorrect he shall certify restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any funds incorrectly withheld or otherwise denied.

    § 301.15   Grants.

#### § § 301.15

    To States with approved plans, a grant is made each quarter for expenditures under the plan for the administration of the Child Support Enforcement program. The determination as to the amount of a grant to be made to a State is based upon documents submitted by the IV-D agency containing information required under the Act and such other pertinent facts as may be found necessary.

    (a) —(1)  States submit this form quarterly to report the actual amount of State and Federal share of title IV-D program expenditures and program income of the current quarter and to report the estimated amount of the State and Federal share of title IV-D program expenditures for the next quarter. This form is completed in accordance with published instructions. The digital signature of the authorized State program official on this document certifies that the reported expenditures and estimates are accurate and that the State has or will have the necessary State share of estimated program expenditures available when needed.

    (2)  States submit this form quarterly to report the State and Federal share of child support collections received, distributed, disbursed, and remaining undistributed under the title IV-D program.

States must use OLDC to submit reporting information electronically. To use OLDC, a State must request access from the ACF Office of Grants Management and use an approved digital signature.

    (2)  Forms OCSE-396 and OCSE-34 must be electronically submitted no later than 45 days following the end of the each fiscal quarter.

    (3)  The data submitted on Forms OCSE-396 and OCSE-34 are subject to analysis and review by the Regional Grants Officer in the appropriate ACF Regional Office and approval by the Director, Office of Grants Management, in the ACF central office. In the course of this analysis, review, and approval process, any reported program expenditures that cannot be determined to be allowable are subject to the deferral procedures found at 45 CFR 201.15 or the disallowance process found at 45 CFR 304.29 and 201.14 and 45 CFR part 16.

    (c) —(1)  The grant award consists of a signed award letter and an accompanying “Computation of Grant Award” to detail the award calculation.

    (2)  The quarterly grant award is based on the information submitted by the State on the financial reporting forms and consists of:

    (i) An advance of funds for the next quarter, based on the State's approved estimate; and

    (ii) The reconciliation of the advance provided for the current quarter, based on the State's approved expenditures.

    (3)  A copy of the grant documents are provided to the HHS Program Support Center's Division of Payment Management, which maintains the Payment Management System (PMS). The State is able to request a drawdown of funds from PMS through a commercial bank and the Federal Reserve System against a continuing letter of credit. The letter of credit system for payment of advances of Federal funds was established pursuant to Treasury Department regulations. (Circular No. 1075).

    (d)  The provisions of part 95 of this title, establishing general administrative requirements for grant programs and part 75 of this title, establishing uniform administrative requirements and cost principles, shall apply to all grants made to the States under this part, with the following exceptions:

    (2) In the case of a political subdivision, by means of a self-bonding system approved by the State IV-D agency.

    (e)  The requirements of this section do not reduce or limit the ultimate liability of the IV-D agency for losses of support collections from the State's IV-D program.

    § 302.20   Separation of cash handling and accounting functions.

#### § § 302.20

    The State plan shall provide that the following requirements and criteria to separate the cash handling and accounting functions are in effect.

    (a)  The IV-D agency will maintain methods of administration designed to assure that persons responsible for handling cash receipts of support do not participate in accounting or operating functions which would permit them to conceal in the accounting records the misuse of support receipts. Such methods of administration shall follow generally recognized accounting standards.

    (b)  The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to persons who participate in the collection, accounting or operating functions which include:

    (1) IV-D agency employees and employees of any other State or local agency to which IV-D functions have been delegated.

    (2) Employees of a court or law enforcement official performing under a cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency.

    (3) Employees of any private or governmental entity from which the IV-D agency purchases services.

    (c)  The Regional Office may grant a waiver to sparsely populated geographical areas, where the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section would necessitate the hiring of unreasonable numbers of additional staff. The IV-D agency must document such administrative infeasibility and provide an alternative system of controls that reasonably insures that support collections will not be misused.

#### § § 302.30

    Effective October 1, 1985, the State plan shall provide that the State will publicize regularly and frequently the availability of support enforcement services under the plan through public service announcements. Publicity must include information on any application fees which may be imposed for such services and a telephone number or postal address where further information may be obtained.

    § 302.31   Establishing paternity and securing support.

#### § § 302.31

    The State plan shall provide that:

    (a) The IV-D agency will undertake:

    (1) In the case of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom an assignment as defined in § 301.1 of this chapter is effective, to establish the paternity of such child; and

    (2) In the case of any individual with respect to whom an assignment as defined in § 301.1 of this chapter is effective, to secure support for a child or children from any person who is legally liable for such support, using State laws regarding intrastate and interstate establishment and enforcement of support obligations. Effective October 1, 1985, this includes securing support for a spouse or former spouse who is living with the child or children, but only if a support obligation has been established for that spouse and the child support obligation is being enforced under the title IV-D State plan.

    (3) When assigned medical support payments are received and retained by a non-IV-A Medicaid recipient, the IV-D agency shall notify the Medicaid agency whenever it discovers that directly received medical support payments are being, or have been, retained.

    (b) Upon receiving notice of a claim of good cause for failure to cooperate, the IV-D agency will suspend all activities to establish paternity or secure support until notified of a final determination by the appropriate agency.

    (c) The IV-D agency will not undertake to establish paternity or secure support in any case for which it has received notice that there has been a finding of good cause unless there has been a determination that support enforcement may proceed without the participation of the caretaker or other relative. If there has been such a determination, the IV-D agency will undertake to establish paternity or secure support but may not involve the caretaker or other relative in such undertaking.

    § 302.32   Collection and disbursement of support payments by the IV-D agency.

#### § § 302.32

    The State plan shall provide that:

    (a) The IV-D agency must establish and operate a State Disbursement Unit (SDU) for the collection and disbursement of payments under support orders—

    (1) In all cases being enforced under the State IV-D plan; and

    (2) In all cases not being enforced under the State IV-D plan in which the support order is initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and in which the income of the noncustodial parent is subject to withholding in accordance with section 466(a)(8)(B) of the Act.

    (b) Timeframes for disbursement of support payments by SDUs under section 454B of the Act.

    (1) In intergovernmental IV-D cases, amounts collected by the responding State on behalf of the initiating agency must be forwarded to the initiating agency within 2 business days of the date of receipt by the SDU in the responding State, in accordance with § 303.7(d)(6)(v) of this chapter.

    (2) Amounts collected by the IV-D agency on behalf of recipients of aid under the State's title IV-A or IV-E plan for whom an assignment under sections 408(a)(3) or 471(a)(17) of the Act is effective shall be disbursed by the SDU within the following timeframes:

    (i) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, if the SDU sends payment to the family (other than payments sent to the family from the State share of assigned support collections), the SDU must send these payments within 2 business days of the end of the month in which the payment was received by the SDU. Any payment passed through to the family from the State share of assigned support collections must be sent to the family within 2 business days of the date of receipt by the SDU.

    (ii) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, when the SDU sends collections to the family for the month after the month the family becomes ineligible for title IV-A, the SDU must send collections to the family within 2 business days of the date of receipt by the SDU.

    (iii) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, when the SDU sends collections to the IV-E foster care agency under § 302.52(b)(2) and (4) of this part, the SDU must send collections to the IV-E agency within 15 business days of the end of the month in which the support was received by the SUD.

    (iv) Collections as a result of Federal tax refund offset paid to the family or distributed in title IV-E foster care cases under § 302.52(b)(4) of this part, must be sent to the title IV-A family or title IV-E agency, as appropriate, within 30 calendar days of the date of initial receipt by the title IV-D agency, unless State law requires a post-offset appeal process and an appeal is filed timely, in which case the SDU must send any payment to the title IV-A family or title IV-E agency within 15 calendar days of the date the appeal is resolved.

    (3)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, amounts collected on behalf of individuals receiving services under § 302.33 of this part shall be disbursed by the SDU pursuant to section 457 of the Act, within 2 business days of receipt by the SDU.

    (ii) Collections due the family as a result of Federal tax refund offset must be sent to the family within 30 calendar days of the date of initial receipt in the title IV-D agency, except:

    § 302.33   Services to individuals not receiving title IV-A assistance.

#### § § 302.33

    (a)  (1) The State plan must provide that the services established under the plan shall be made available to any individual who:

    (i) Files an application for the services with the IV-D agency. In an interstate case, only the initiating State may require an application under this section; or

    (ii) Is a non-IV-A Medicaid recipient; or

    (iii) Has been receiving IV-D services and is no longer eligible for assistance under the title IV-A, IV-E foster care, and Medicaid program.

    (2) The State may not require an application, other request for services or an application fee from any individual who is eligible to receive services under paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. If an individual receiving services under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section refuses services in response to a notice under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and subsequently requests services, that individual must file an application and pay an application fee.

    (3) The State may not charge fees or recover costs from any individual who is eligible to receive services under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (4) Whenever a family is no longer eligible for assistance under the State's title IV-A and Medicaid programs, the IV-D agency must notify the family, within 5 working days of the notification of ineligibility, that IV-D services will be continued unless the family notifies the IV-D agency that it no longer wants services but instead wants to close the case. This notice must inform the family of the benefits and consequences of continuing to receive IV-D services, including the available services and the State's fees, cost recovery, and distribution policies. This requirement to notify the family that services will be continued, unless the family notifies the IV-D agency to the contrary, also applies when a child is no longer eligible for IV-E foster care, but only in those cases that the IV-D agency determines that such services and notice would be appropriate.

    (5) The State must provide all appropriate IV-D services, in addition to IV-D services related to securing medical support, to all individuals who are eligible to receive services under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section unless the individual notifies the State that only IV-D services related to securing medical support are wanted.

    (6) The State may elect in its State plan to allow an individual under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section who files an application to request paternity-only limited services in an intrastate case. If the State chooses this option, the State must define how this process will be implemented and must establish and use procedures, including domestic violence safeguards, which are reflected in a record, that specify when paternity-only limited services will be available. An application will be considered full-service unless the parent specifically applies for paternity-only limited services in accordance with the State's procedures. If one parent specifically requests paternity-only limited services and the other parent requests full services, the case will automatically receive full services. The State will be required to charge the application and service fees required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section for paternity-only limited services, and may recover costs in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section if the State has chosen this option in its State plan. The State must provide the applicant an application form with information on the availability of paternity-only limited services, consequences of selecting this limited service, and an explanation that the case will be closed when the limited service is completed.

    (b)  For purposes of this section:

    means the disposable income available for the applicant's use under State law.

    (c)  (1) Beginning October 1, 1985, the State plan must provide that an application fee will be charged for each individual who applies for services under this section. Under this paragraph:

    (i) The State shall collect the application fee from the individual applying for IV-D services or pay the application fee out of State funds.

    (ii) The State may recover the application fee from the noncustodial parent who owes a support obligation to a non-IV-A family on whose behalf the IV-D agency is providing services and repay it to the applicant or itself.

    (iii) State funds used to pay an application fee are not program expenditures under the State plan but are program income under § 304.50 of this chapter.

    (iv) Any application fee charged must be uniformly applied on a statewide basis and must be:

    (A) A flat dollar amount not to exceed $25 (or such higher or lower amount as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate for any fiscal year to reflect increases or decreases in administrative costs); or

    (B) An amount based on a fee schedule not to exceed the flat dollar amount specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. The fee schedule must be based on the applicant's income.

    (v) The State may allow the jurisdiction that collects support for the State under this part to retain any application fee collected under this section.

    (2) In an interstate case, the application fee is charged by the State where the individual applies for services under this section.

    (d)  (1) The State may elect in its State plan to recover any costs incurred in excess of any fees collected to cover administrative costs under the IV-D State plan. A State which elects to recover costs shall collect on a case by case basis either excess actual or standardized costs:

    (i) From the individual who owes a support obligation to a non-IV-A family on whose behalf the IV-D agency is providing services under this section; or

    (ii) From the individual who is receiving IV-D services under paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this section, either directly or from the support collected on behalf of the individual, but only if the State has in effect a procedure for informing all individuals authorized within the State to establish an obligation for support that the State will recover costs from the individual receiving IV-D services under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (iii) of this section.

    (2) A State that recovers standardized costs under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall develop a methodology, which is reflected in a record, to determine standardized costs which are as close to actual costs as is possible. This methodology must be made available to any individual upon request.

    (3) The IV-D agency shall not treat any amount collected from the individual as a recovery of costs under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section except amounts which exceed the current support owed by the individual under the obligation.

    (4) If a State elects to recover costs under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the IV-D agency may attempt to seek reimbursement from the individual who owes a support obligation for any costs paid by the individual who is receiving IV-D services and pay all amounts reimbursed to the individual who is receiving IV-D services.

    (5) If a State elects to recover costs under this section, the IV-D agency must notify, consistent with the option selected, either the individual who is receiving IV-D services under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this section, or the individual who owes a support obligation that such recovery will be made. In an interstate case, the IV-D agency where the case originated must notify the individual receiving IV-D services of the States that recover costs.

    (6) The IV-D agency must notify the IV-D agencies in all other States if it recovers costs from the individual receiving IV-D services.

    (e)  (1) A State must impose in, and report for, a Federal fiscal year an annual fee of $35 for each case if there is an individual in the case to whom IV-D services are provided and:

    (i) For whom the State has collected and disbursed to the family at least $550 of support in that year; and

    (ii) No individual in the case has received assistance under a former State AFDC program, assistance as defined in § 260.31 under a State TANF program, or assistance as defined in § 286.10 under a Tribal TANF program.

    (2) The State must impose the annual $35 fee in international cases under section 454(32) of the Act in which the criteria for imposition of the annual $35 fee under paragraph (1) of this section are met.

    (3) For each Federal fiscal year, after the first $550 of support is collected and disbursed to the family, the fee must be collected by one or more of the following methods:

    (i) Retained by the State from support collected in cases subject to the fee in accordance with distribution requirements in § 302.51(a)(5) of this part, except that no cost will be assessed for such services against:

    (A) A foreign obligee in an international case receiving IV-D services pursuant to section 454(32)(C) of the Act; and

    (B) An individual who is required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7;

    (ii) Paid by the individual applying for services under section 454(4)(A)(ii) of the Act and implementing regulations in this section, provided that the individual is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7;

    (iii) Recovered from the noncustodial parent, provided that the noncustodial parent is not an individual required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7; or

    (iv) Paid by the State out of its own funds.

    (4) The State must report, in accordance with § 302.15 of this part and instructions issued by the Secretary, the total amount of annual $35 fees imposed under this section for each Federal fiscal year as program income, regardless of which method or methods are used under paragraph (3) of this section.

    (5) State funds used to pay the annual $35 fee shall not be considered administrative costs of the State for the operation of the title IV-D plan, and all annual $35 fees imposed during a Federal fiscal year must be considered income to the program, in accordance with § 304.50 of this chapter.

    § 302.34   Cooperative arrangements.

#### § § 302.34

    The State plan shall provide that the State will enter into agreements, which are reflected in a record, for cooperative arrangements under § 303.107 of this chapter with appropriate courts; law enforcement officials, such as district attorneys, attorneys general, and similar public attorneys and prosecutors; corrections officials; and Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations. Such arrangements may be entered into with a single official covering more than one court, official, or agency, if the single official has the legal authority to enter into arrangements on behalf of the courts, officials, or agencies. Such arrangements shall contain provisions for providing courts and law enforcement officials with pertinent information needed in locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity and securing support, to the extent that such information is relevant to the duties to be performed pursuant to the arrangement. They shall also provide for assistance to the IV-D agency in carrying out the program, and may relate to any other matters of common concern. Under matters of common concern, such arrangements may include provisions for the investigation and prosecution of fraud directly related to paternity and child and spousal support, and provisions to reimburse courts and law enforcement officials for their assistance.

    (a)  The IV-D agency shall maintain a State PLS to provide locate information to authorized persons for authorized purposes.

    (1)  The State PLS shall access the Federal PLS and all relevant sources of information and records available in the State, and in other States as appropriate, for locating custodial parents, noncustodial parents, and children for IV-D purposes.

    (2)  (i) The State PLS shall access and release information authorized to be disclosed under section 453(a)(2) and 453(j)(3) of the Act from the Federal PLS and, in accordance with State law, information from relevant in-State sources of information and records, as appropriate, for locating custodial parents, noncustodial parents, non-parent relatives, and children upon request of authorized individuals specified in paragraph (c) of this section, for authorized purposes specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

    (ii) The State PLS shall not release information from the computerized support enforcement system required under part 307 of this chapter, IRS information, or financial institution data match information, nor shall the State PLS forward a non-IV-D request to another State IV-D agency.

    (b)  The IV-D program shall maintain a central State PLS to submit requests to the Federal PLS.

    (c)  The State PLS shall accept requests for locate information only from the following authorized persons:

    (1) Any State or local agency providing child and spousal support services under the State plan, and any Tribal IV-D agency providing child and spousal support services under a Tribal plan approved under 45 CFR part 309, provided the State and Tribe have in effect an intergovernmental agreement for the provision of Federal PLS services;

    (2) In title IV-A and title IV-E foster care cases in which conversion to a monthly amount is necessary because support is ordered to be paid other than monthly, the IV-D agency may round off the converted amount to whole dollar amount for the purpose of distribution under this section and § 302.52 of this part.

    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii), amounts collected through Federal tax refund offset must be distributed as arrearages in accordance with § 303.72 of this chapter, and section 457 of the Act;

    (ii) Effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, amounts collected through Federal tax refund offset shall be distributed in accordance with § 303.72 of this chapter and the option selected under section 454(34) of the Act.

    (4)(i) Effective October 1, 1998 (or October 1, 1999 if applicable) except with respect to those collections addressed under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and except as specified under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, with respect to amounts collected and distributed under title IV-D of the Act, the date of collection for distribution purposes in all IV-D cases is the date of receipt in the State disbursement unit established under section 454B of the Act.

    (ii) If current support is withheld by an employer in the month when due, and received by the State in a month other than the month when due, the date of withholding may be deemed to be the date of collection.

    (iii) When the date of collection pursuant to this subparagraph is deemed to be the date the wage or other income was withheld, and the employer fails to report the date of withholding, the IV-D agency must reconstruct that date by contacting the employer or comparing actual amounts collected with the pay schedule specified in the court or administrative order.

    (5)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii), a State must pay to a family that has never received assistance under a program funded or approved under title IV-A or foster care under title IV-E of the Act and to an individual who is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7 the portion of the amount collected that remains after withholding any annual $35 fee that the State imposes under § 302.33(e) of this part.

    (ii) If a State charges the noncustodial parent the annual $35 fee under § 302.33(e) of this part, the State may retain the $35 fee from the support collected after current support and any payment on arrearages for the month under a court or administrative order have been disbursed to the family provided the noncustodial parent is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7.

    (b) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be applied to such future months. However, no such amounts shall be applied to future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the support obligation assigned under section 403(a)(8) of the Act for the current month and all past months.

    (c)(1) The amounts collected by the IV-D agency which represent specific dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical purposes that have been assigned to the State under 42 CFR 433.146 shall be forwarded to the Medicaid agency for distribution under 42 CFR 433.154.

    (2) When a family ceases receiving assistance under the State's title XIX plan, the assignment of medical support rights under section 1912 of the Act terminates, except for the amount of any unpaid medical support obligation that has accrued under such assignment. The IV-D agency shall attempt to collect any unpaid specific dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical purposes. Under this requirement, any medical support collection made by the IV-D agency under this paragraph shall be forwarded to the Medicaid agency for distribution under 42 CFR 433.154.

    § 302.52   Distribution of support collected in Title IV-E foster care maintenance cases.

#### § § 302.52

    Effective October 1, 1984, the State plan shall provide as follows:

    (a) For purposes of distribution under this section, amounts collected in foster care maintenance cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of § 302.51(a) of this part.

    (b) The amounts collected as support by the IV-D agency under the State plan on behalf of children for whom the State is making foster care maintenance payments under the title IV-E State plan and for whom an assignment under section 471(a)(17) of the Act is effective shall be distributed as follows:

    (1) Any amount that is collected in a month which represents payment on the required support obligation for that month shall be retained by the State to reimburse itself for foster care maintenance payments. Of that amount retained by the State as reimbursement for that month's foster care maintenance payment, the State IV-D agency shall determine the Federal government's share so that the State may reimburse the Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing of the foster care maintenance payment.

    (2) If the amount collected is in excess of the monthly amount of the foster care maintenance payment but not more than the monthly support obligation, the State must pay the excess to the State agency responsible for supervising the child's placement and care under section 472(a)(2) of the Act. The State agency must use the money in the manner it determines will serve the best interests of the child including:

    (i) Setting aside amounts for the child's future needs; or

    (ii) Making all or part of the amount available to the person responsible for meeting the child's daily needs to be used for the child's benefit.

    (3) If the amount collected exceeds the amount required to be distributed under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, but not the total unreimbursed foster care maintenance payments provided under title IV-E or unreimbursed assistance payments provided under title IV-A, the State shall retain the excess to reimburse itself for these payments. If past assistance or foster care maintenance payments are greater than the total support obligation owed, the maximum amount the State may retain as reimbursement for such payments is the amount of such obligation. If amounts are collected which represent the required support obligation for periods prior to the first month in which the family received assistance under the State's title IV-A plan or foster care maintenance payments under the State's title IV-E plan, such amounts may be retained by the State to reimburse the difference between such support obligation and such payments. Of the amounts retained by the State, the State IV-D agency shall determine the Federal government's share of the amount so that the State may reimburse the Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing the assistance payments and foster care maintenance payments.

    (4) Any balance shall be paid to the State agency responsible for supervising the child's placement and care and shall be used to serve the best interests of the child as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (5) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be applied to those future months. However, no amounts shall be applied to future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the support obligation assigned under sections 408(a)(3) and 471 (a)(17) of the Act for the current month and all past months.

    (c) When a State ceases making foster care maintenance payments under the State's title IV-E State plan, the assignment of support rights under section 471(a)(17) of the Act terminates except for the amount of any unpaid support that has accrued under the assignment. The IV-D agency shall attempt to collect such unpaid support. Under this requirement, any collection made by the State under this paragraph must be distributed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

    § 302.54   Notice of collection of assigned support.

#### § § 302.54

    (a) Effective January 1, 1993, the State plan shall provide that the State has in effect procedures for issuing notices of collections as follows:

    (1) The IV-D agency must provide a monthly notice of the amount of support payments collected for each month to individuals who have assigned rights to support under section 408(a)(3) of the Act, unless no collection is made in the month, the assignment is no longer in effect and there are no longer any assigned arrearages, or the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section are met.

    (2) The monthly notice must list separately payments collected from each noncustodial parent when more than one noncustodial parent owes support to the family and must indicate the amount of current support collected, the amount of arrearages collected and the amount of support collected which was paid to the family.

    (b)(1) The Office may grant a waiver to permit a State to provide quarterly, rather than monthly, notices, if the State:

    (i) Until September 30, 1997, does not have an automated system that performs child support enforcement activities consistent with § 302.85 or has an automated system that is unable to generate monthly notices; or

    (ii) Uses a toll-free automated voice response system which provides the information required under paragraph (a) of this section.

    (2) A quarterly notice must be provided in accordance with conditions set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and such notice must contain the information set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

    Effective October 1, 1985, in order for the State to be eligible to receive any incentive payments under § 304.12 and part 305 of this chapter, the State plan shall provide that, if one or more political subdivisions of the State participate in the costs of carrying out the activities under the State plan during any period, each such subdivision shall be entitled to receive an appropriate share of any incentive payments made to the State for such period, as determined by the State in accordance with § 303.52 of this chapter, taking into account the efficiency and effectiveness of the political subdivision in carrying out the activities under the State plan.

    § 302.56   Guidelines for setting child support orders.

#### § § 302.56

    (a) Within 1 year after completion of the State's next quadrennial review of its child support guidelines, that commences more than 1 year after publication of the final rule, in accordance with § 302.56(e), as a condition of approval of its State plan, the State must establish one set of child support guidelines by law or by judicial or administrative action for setting and modifying child support order amounts within the State that meet the requirements in this section.

    (b) The State must have procedures for making the guidelines available to all persons in the State.

    (c) The child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section must at a minimum:

    (1) Provide that the child support order is based on the noncustodial parent's earnings, income, and other evidence of ability to pay that:

    (i) Takes into consideration all earnings and income of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent);

    (ii) Takes into consideration the basic subsistence needs of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent and children) who has a limited ability to pay by incorporating a low-income adjustment, such as a self-support reserve or some other method determined by the State; and

    (iii) If imputation of income is authorized, takes into consideration the specific circumstances of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent) to the extent known, including such factors as the noncustodial parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, age, health, criminal record and other employment barriers, and record of seeking work, as well as the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the noncustodial parent, prevailing earnings level in the local community, and other relevant background factors in the case.

    (2) Address how the parents will provide for the child's health care needs through private or public health care coverage and/or through cash medical support;

    (3) Provide that incarceration may not be treated as voluntary unemployment in establishing or modifying support orders; and

    (4) Be based on specific descriptive and numeric criteria and result in a computation of the child support obligation.

    (d) The State must include a copy of the child support guidelines in its State plan.

    (e) The State must review, and revise, if appropriate, the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section at least once every four years to ensure that their application results in the determination of appropriate child support order amounts. The State shall publish on the internet and make accessible to the public all reports of the guidelines reviewing body, the membership of the reviewing body, the effective date of the guidelines, and the date of the next quadrennial review.

    (f) The State must provide that there will be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment and modification of a child support order, that the amount of the order which would result from the application of the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section is the correct amount of child support to be ordered.

    (g) A written finding or specific finding on the record of a judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment or modification of a child support order that the application of the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case will be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case, as determined under criteria established by the State. Such criteria must take into consideration the best interests of the child. Findings that rebut the child support guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and include a justification of why the order varies from the guidelines.

    (h) As part of the review of a State's child support guidelines required under paragraph (e) of this section, a State must:

    (1) Consider economic data on the cost of raising children, labor market data (such as unemployment rates, employment rates, hours worked, and earnings) by occupation and skill-level for the State and local job markets, the impact of guidelines policies and amounts on custodial and noncustodial parents who have family incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, and factors that influence employment rates among noncustodial parents and compliance with child support orders;

    (2) Analyze case data, gathered through sampling or other methods, on the application of and deviations from the child support guidelines, as well as the rates of default and imputed child support orders and orders determined using the low-income adjustment required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The analysis must also include a comparison of payments on child support orders by case characteristics, including whether the order was entered by default, based on imputed income, or determined using the low-income adjustment required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii). The analysis of the data must be used in the State's review of the child support guidelines to ensure that deviations from the guidelines are limited and guideline amounts are appropriate based on criteria established by the State under paragraph (g); and

    (3) Provide a meaningful opportunity for public input, including input from low-income custodial and noncustodial parents and their representatives. The State must also obtain the views and advice of the State child support agency funded under title IV-D of the Act.

    (a) The IV-D agency has in effect procedures necessary to obtain payment of past-due support from Federal tax refunds as set forth in section 464 of the Act, § 303.72 of this chapter, and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service at 26 CFR 304.6402-1; and

    § 302.65   Withholding of unemployment compensation.

#### § § 302.65

    The State plan shall provide that the requirements of this section are met.

    (a)  When used in this section:

    means a writ, order, summons or other similar process in the nature of a garnishment, which is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by an authorized official pursuant to an order of such court or pursuant to State or local law.

    or  means the State agency charged with the administration of the State unemployment compensation laws in accordance with title III of the Act.

    means any compensation payable under State unemployment compensation law (including amounts payable in accordance with agreements under any Federal unemployment compensation law). It includes extended benefits, unemployment compensation for Federal employees, unemployment compensation for ex-servicemen, trade readjustment allowances, disaster unemployment assistance, and payments under the Redwood National Park Expansion Act.

    (b)  The State IV-D agency shall enter into an agreement, which is reflected in a record, with the SWA in its State for the purpose of withholding unemployment compensation from individuals with unmet support obligations being enforced by the IV-D agency. The IV-D agency shall agree only to a withholding program that it expects to be cost effective and to reimbursement for the SWA's actual, incremental costs of providing services to the IV-D agency.

    (c)  The IV-D agency shall:

    (1) Determine periodically from information provided by the SWA under section 508 of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 whether individuals applying for or receiving unemployment compensation owe support obligations that are being enforced by the IV-D agency.

    (2) Enforce unmet support obligations by arranging for the withholding of unemployment compensation based on a voluntary agreement with the individual who owes the support, or in appropriate cases which meet the case selection criteria established under paragraph (c)(3), through legal process pursuant to State or local law. If a voluntary agreement is obtained, the IV-D agency must give the SWA a copy of the voluntary agreement.

    (3) Establish and use criteria, which are reflected in a record, for selecting cases to pursue via the withholding of unemployment compensation for support purposes. These criteria must be designed to ensure maximum case selection and minimal discretion in the selection process.

    (4) Provide a receipt at least annually to an individual who requests a receipt for the support paid via the withholding of unemployment compensation, if receipts are not provided through other means.

    (5) Maintain direct contact with the SWA in its State:

    (i) By processing cases through the SWA in its own State or through IV-D agencies in other States; and

    (ii) By receiving all amounts withheld by the SWA in its own State and forwarding any amounts withheld on behalf of IV-D agencies in other States to those agencies.

    (6) Reimburse the administrative costs incurred by the SWA that are actual, incremental costs attributable to the process of withholding unemployment compensation for support purposes insofar as these costs have been agreed upon by the SWA and the IV-D agency.

    (7) Review and document, at least annually, program operations, including case selection criteria established under paragraph (c)(3), and costs of the withholding process versus the amounts collected and, as necessary, modify procedures and renegotiate the services provided by the SWA to improve program and cost effectiveness.

#### § § 302.70

    (a)  The State plan shall provide that, in accordance with sections 454(20) and 466 of the Act and part 303 of this chapter, the State has in effect laws providing for, and has implemented procedures to improve, program effectiveness:

    (1) Procedures for carrying out a program of withholding under which new or existing support orders are subject to the State law governing withholding so that a portion of the noncustodial parent's wages may be withheld, in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 303.100 of this chapter;

    (2) Expedited processes to establish paternity and to establish and enforce child support orders having the same force and effect as those established through full judicial process, in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 303.101 of this chapter;

    (3) Procedures for obtaining overdue support from State income tax refunds on behalf of individuals receiving IV-D services, in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 303.102 of this chapter;

    (4) Procedures for the imposition of liens against the real and personal property of noncustodial parents who owe overdue support;

    (5)(i) Procedures for the establishment of paternity for any child at least to the child's 18th birthday, including any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was previously dismissed under a statute of limitations of less than 18 years; and

    (ii) Effective November 1, 1989, procedures under which the State is required (except in cases where the individual involved has been found under section 454(29) of the Act to have good cause for refusing to cooperate or if, in accordance with § 303.5(b) of this chapter the IV-D agency has determined that it would not be in the best interest of the child to establish paternity in a case involving incest or forcible rape, or in any case in which legal proceedings for adoption are pending) to require the child and all other parties in a contested paternity case to submit to genetic tests upon the request of any such party, in accordance with § 303.5 (d) and (e) of this chapter.

    (iii) Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that, before a mother and putative father can sign a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the mother and the putative father must be given notice, orally or through video or audio equipment, and in writing, of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights (including any rights, if a parent is a minor, due to minority status) and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity, and ensure that due process safeguards are afforded. Such procedures must include:

    (A) A hospital-based program in accordance with § 303.5(g) for the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity during the period immediately before or after the birth of a child to an unmarried mother, and a requirement that all public and private birthing hospitals participate in the hospital-based program defined in § 303.5(g)(2); and

    (B) A process for voluntary acknowledgment of paternity in hospitals, State birth record agencies, and in other entities designated by the State and participating in the State's voluntary paternity establishment program; and

    (C) A requirement that the procedures governing hospital-based programs and State birth record agencies must also apply to other entities designated by the State and participating in the State's voluntary paternity establishment program, including the use of the same notice provisions, the same materials, the same evaluation methods, and the same training for the personnel of these other entities providing voluntary paternity establishment services.

    (iv) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity;

    (v) Procedures which provide that any objection to genetic testing results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence; and if no objection is made, a report of the test results, which is reflected in a record, is admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy;

    (vi) Procedures which create a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results indicating a threshold probability of the alleged father being the father of the child;

    (vii) Procedures under which a voluntary acknowledgment must be recognized as a basis for seeking a support order without requiring any further proceedings to establish paternity; and

    (viii) Procedures requiring a default order to be entered in a paternity case upon a showing that process was served on the defendant in accordance with State law, that the defendant failed to respond to service in accordance with State procedures, and any additional showing required by State law.

    (6) Procedures which require that a noncustodial parent give security, post a bond, or give some other guarantee to secure payment of support, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 303.104 of this chapter;

    (7) Procedures for making information regarding the amount of overdue support owed by a noncustodial parent available to consumer reporting agencies;

    (9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, is (on and after the date it is due):

    (i) A judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced;

    (ii) Entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State; and

    (iii) Not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State, except as provided in § 303.106(b).

    (10) Procedures for the review and adjustment of child support orders in accordance with § 303.8(b) of this chapter.

    (11) Procedures under which the State must give full faith and credit to a determination of paternity made by any other State, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes.

    (b) A State need not apply a procedure required under paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (6) and (7) of this section in an individual case if the State determines that it is not appropriate using guidelines generally available to the public which take into account the payment record of the noncustodial parent, the availability of other remedies, and other relevant considerations. The guidelines may not determine a majority of cases in which no other remedy is being used to be inappropriate.

    (c) State laws enacted under this section must give States sufficient authority to comply with the requirements of §§ 303.100 through 303.102 and § 303.104 of this chapter.

    (d)(1)  A State may apply for an exemption from any of the requirements of section 466 of the Act by the submittal of a request for exemption to the appropriate Regional Office.

    (2)  The Secretary will grant a State, or political subdivision in the case of section 466(a)(2) of the Act, an exemption from any of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for a period not to exceed 5 years if the State demonstrates that compliance would not increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its Child Support Enforcement program. Demonstration of the program's efficiency and effectiveness must be shown by actual, or, if actual is not available, estimated data pertaining to caseloads, processing times, administrative costs, and average support collections or such other actual or estimated data as the Office may request. The State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the program's effectiveness would not improve by using these procedures. Disapproval of a request for exemption is not subject to appeal.

    (3)  The exemption is subject to continuing review by the Secretary and may be terminated upon a change in circumstances or reduced effectiveness in the State or political subdivision, if the State cannot demonstrate that the changed circumstances continue to warrant an exemption in accordance with this section.

    (4)  The State must request an extension of the exemption by submitting current data in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section 90 days prior to the end of the exemption period granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

    (5)  If the Secretary revokes an exemption or does not grant an extension of an exemption, the State must enact the appropriate laws and procedures to implement the mandatory practice by the beginning of the fourth month after the end of the first regular, special, budget or other session of the State's legislature which ends after the date the exemption is revoked or the extension is denied. If no State law is necessary, the State must establish and be using the procedure by the beginning of the fourth month after the date the exemption is revoked.

#### § § 302.75

    (a) Effective September 1, 1984, the State plan may provide for imposition of late payment fees on noncustodial parents who owe overdue support.

    (b) If a State opts to impose late payment fees—

    (1) The late payment fee must be uniformly applied in an amount not less than 3 percent nor more than 6 percent of overdue support.

    (2) The fee shall accrue as arrearages accumulate and shall not be reduced upon partial payment of arrears. The fee may be collected only after the full amount of overdue support is paid and any requirements under State law for notice to the noncustodial parent have been met.

    (3) The collection of the fee must not directly or indirectly reduce the amount of current or overdue support paid to the individual to whom it is owed.

    (4) The late payment fee must be imposed in cases where there has been an assignment under section 408(a)(3) of the Act or section 471(a)(17) of the Act or the IV-D agency is providing services under § 302.33 of this chapter.

    § 303.5   Establishment of paternity.

#### § § 303.5

    (a) For all cases referred to the IV-D agency or applying for services under § 302.33 of this chapter in which paternity has not been established, the IV-D agency must, as appropriate:

    (2) Attempt to establish paternity by legal process established under State law.

    (b) The IV-D agency need not attempt to establish paternity in any case involving incest or forcible rape, or in any case in which legal proceedings for adoption are pending, if, in the opinion of the IV-D agency, it would not be in the best interests of the child to establish paternity.

    (c) The IV-D agency must identify and use through competitive procurement laboratories which perform, at reasonable cost, legally and medically acceptable genetic tests which tend to identify the father or exclude the alleged father. The IV-D agency must make available a list of such laboratories to appropriate courts and law enforcement officials, and to the public upon request.

    (d)(1) Upon request of any party in a contested paternity case in accordance with section 466(a)(5)(B) of the Act, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the IV-D agency shall require all parties to submit to genetic tests unless, in the case of an individual receiving aid under the State's title IV-A, IV-E or XIX plan, or those recipients of the food stamp program, as defined under section 3(h) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 who are required to cooperate with the child support program, there has been a determination of good cause for refusal to cooperate under section 454(29) of the Act.

    (2) A contested paternity case is any action in which the issue of paternity may be raised under State law and one party denies paternity.

    (e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the IV-D agency may charge any individual who is not a recipient of aid under the State's title IV-A or XIX plan a reasonable fee for performing genetic tests.

    (2) Any fee charged must be reasonable so as not to discourage those in need of paternity establishment services from seeking them and may not exceed the actual costs of the genetic tests.

    (3) If paternity is established and genetic tests were ordered by the IV-D agency, the IV-D agency must pay the costs of such tests, subject to recoupment (if the agency elects) from the alleged father who denied paternity. If a party contests the results of an original test, the IV-D agency shall obtain additional tests but shall require the contestant to pay for the costs of any such additional testing in advance.

    (4) The IV-D agency must use any amount collected under paragraphs (e) (1) and (3) of this section that exceeds the costs of performing genetic tests to reimburse any fee paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this chapter.

    (f) The IV-D agency must seek entry of a default order by the court or administrative authority in a paternity case by showing that process has been served on the defendant in accordance with State law, that the defendant has failed to respond to service in accordance with State procedures, and any additional showing required by State law, in accordance with § 302.70(a)(5)(viii).

    (g)  (1) The State must establish, in cooperation with hospitals, State birth record agencies, and other entities designated by the State and participating in the State's voluntary paternity establishment program, a program for voluntary paternity establishment services.

    (E) Secondary education schools (particularly those that have parenthood education curricula);

    (F) Legal Aid agencies, and private attorneys; and

    (G) Any similar public or private health, welfare or social services organization.

    (4) The State must require that a voluntary acknowledgment be signed by both parents, and that the parents' signatures be authenticated by a notary or witness(es).

    (5) The State must provide to all hospitals, State birth record agencies, and other entities designated by the State and participating in the State's voluntary paternity establishment program:

If any entity other than the State registry of birth records is designated by the State, a copy must be filed with the State registry of birth records, in accordance with § 303.5(g)(2)(iv). Under State procedures, the designated entity must be responsible for promptly recording identifying information about the acknowledgments with a statewide database, and the IV-D agency must have timely access to whatever identifying information and documentation it needs to determine in accordance with § 303.5(h) if an acknowledgment has been recorded and to seek a support order on the basis of a recorded acknowledgment in accordance with § 303.4(f).

    (h) In IV-D cases needing paternity establishment, the IV-D agency must determine if identifying information about a voluntary acknowledgment has been recorded in the statewide database in accordance with § 303.5(g)(8).

    § 303.8   Review and adjustment of child support orders.

#### § § 303.8

    (a) Definition. For purposes of this section,  includes any custodial parent or noncustodial parent (or for purposes of requesting a review, any other person or entity who may have standing to request an adjustment to the child support order).

    (b)  Pursuant to section 466(a)(10) of the Act, when providing services under this chapter:

    (1) The State must have procedures under which, within 36 months after establishment of the order or the most recent review of the order (or such shorter cycle as the State may determine), if there is an assignment under part A, or upon the request of either parent, the State shall, with respect to a support order being enforced under title IV-D of the Act, taking into account the best interests of the child involved:

    (i) Review and, if appropriate, adjust the order in accordance with the State's guidelines established pursuant to section 467(a) of the Act if the amount of the child support award under the order differs from the amount that would be awarded in accordance with the guidelines;

    (ii) Apply a cost-of-living adjustment to the order in accordance with a formula developed by the State; or

    (iii) Use automated methods (including automated comparisons with wage or State income tax data) to identify orders eligible for review, conduct the review, identify orders eligible for adjustment, and apply the appropriate adjustment to the orders eligible for adjustment under any threshold that may be established by the State.

    (2) The State may elect in its State plan to initiate review of an order, after learning that a noncustodial parent will be incarcerated for more than 180 calendar days, without the need for a specific request and, upon notice to both parents, review and, if appropriate, adjust the order, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

    (3) If the State elects to conduct the review under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the State must have procedures which permit either party to contest the adjustment, within 30 days after the date of the notice of the adjustment, by making a request for review and, if appropriate, adjustment of the order in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 467(a) of the Act.

    (4) If the State conducts a guideline review under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section:

    (i)  means an objective evaluation, conducted through a proceeding before a court, quasi-judicial process, or administrative body or agency, of information necessary for application of the State's guidelines for support to determine:

    (A) The appropriate support award amount; and

    (B) The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the order through health insurance coverage or other means.

    (ii)  applies only to the child support provisions of the order, and means:

    (A) An upward or downward change in the amount of child support based upon an application of State guidelines for setting and adjusting child support awards; and/or

    (B) Provision for the child's health care needs, through health insurance coverage or other means.

    (5) The State must have procedures which provide that any adjustment under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be made without a requirement for proof or showing of a change in circumstances.

    (6) The State must have procedures under which, in the case of a request for a review, and if appropriate, an adjustment outside the 3-year cycle (or such shorter cycle as the State may determine) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State shall review and, if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances, adjust the order in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 467(a) of the Act.

    (7) The State must provide notice—

    (i) Not less than once every 3 years to both parents subject to an order informing the parents of their right to request the State to review and, if appropriate, adjust the order consistent with this section. The notice must specify the place and manner in which the request should be made. The initial notice may be included in the order.

    (ii) If the State has not elected paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within 15 business days of when the IV-D agency learns that a noncustodial parent will be incarcerated for more than 180 calendar days, to both parents informing them of the right to request the State to review and, if appropriate, adjust the order, consistent with this section. The notice must specify, at a minimum, the place and manner in which the request should be made. Neither the notice nor a review is required under this paragraph if the State has a comparable law or rule that modifies a child support obligation upon incarceration by operation of State law.

    (c) Standard for adequate grounds. The State may establish a reasonable quantitative standard based upon either a fixed dollar amount or percentage, or both, as a basis for determining whether an inconsistency between the existent child support award amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review is adequate grounds for petitioning for adjustment of the order. Such reasonable quantitative standard must not exclude incarceration as a basis for determining whether an inconsistency between the existing child support order amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review is adequate grounds for petitioning for adjustment of the order.

    (d)  The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the order, through health insurance or other means, must be an adequate basis under State law to initiate an adjustment of an order, regardless of whether an adjustment in the amount of child support is necessary.

    (e) Timeframes for review and adjustment. Within 180 calendar days of receiving a request for a review or locating the non-requesting parent, whichever occurs later, a State must: Conduct a review of the order and adjust the order or determine that the order should not be adjusted, in accordance with this section.

    (f) Interstate review and adjustment. (1) In interstate cases, the State with legal authority to adjust the order must conduct the review and adjust the order pursuant to this section.

    (2) The applicable laws and procedures for review and adjustment of child support orders, including the State guidelines for setting child support awards, established in accordance with § 302.56 of this chapter, are those of the State in which the review and adjustment, or determination that there be no adjustment, takes place.

    § 303.31   Securing and enforcing medical support obligations.

#### § § 303.31

    (a) For purposes of this section:

    (1) Cash medical support means an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of health insurance provided by a public entity or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or for other medical costs not covered by insurance.

    (2) Health care coverage includes fee for service, health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, and other types of private health insurance and public health care coverage under which medical services could be provided to the dependent child(ren).

    (3) Cash medical support or the cost of health insurance is considered reasonable in cost if the cost to the parent responsible for providing medical support does not exceed five percent of his or her gross income or, at State option, a reasonable alternative income-based numeric standard defined in State law, regulations, or court rule having the force of law or State child support guidelines adopted in accordance with § 302.56(c) of this chapter.

    (b) The State IV-D agency must:

    (1) Petition the court or administrative authority to—

    (i) Include health care coverage that is accessible to the child(ren), as defined by the State, and is available to the parent responsible for providing medical support and can be obtained for the child at reasonable cost, as defined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, in new or modified court or administrative orders for support; and

    (ii) Allocate the cost of coverage between the parents.

    (2) If health care coverage described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not available at the time the order is entered or modified, petition to include cash medical support in new or modified orders until such time as health care coverage, that is accessible and reasonable in cost as defined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, becomes available. In appropriate cases, as defined by the State, cash medical support may be sought in addition to health care coverage.

    (3) Establish criteria, which are reflected in a record, to identify orders that do not address the health care needs of children based on—

    (i) Evidence that health care coverage may be available to either parent at reasonable cost, as defined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

    (ii) Facts, as defined by State law, regulation, procedure, or other directive, and review and adjustment requirements under § 303.8(d) of this part, which are sufficient to warrant modification of the existing support order to address the health care needs of children in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (4) Petition the court or administrative authority to modify support orders, in accordance with State child support guidelines, for cases identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to include health care coverage and/or cash medical support in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (5) Periodically communicate with the Medicaid agency to determine whether there have been lapses in health insurance coverage for Medicaid applicants and recipients.

    (c) The IV-D agency shall inform an individual who is eligible for services under § 302.33 of this chapter that medical support services will be provided and shall provide the services specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (a)  States must have laws, in accordance with section 466(a)(19) of the Act, requiring procedures specified under paragraph (c) of this section for the use, where appropriate, of the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN), to enforce the provision of health care coverage for children of noncustodial parents and, at State option, custodial parents who are required to provide health care coverage through an employment-related group health plan pursuant to a child support order and for whom the employer is known to the State agency.

    (b)  States are not required to use the NMSN in cases with court or administrative orders that stipulate alternative health care coverage to employer-based coverage.

    (c)  The State must have in effect and use procedures under which:

    (1) The State agency must use the NMSN to transfer notice of the provision for health care coverage of the child(ren) to employers.

    (2) The State agency must transfer the NMSN to the employer within two business days after the date of entry of an employee who is an obligor in a IV-D case in the State Directory of New Hires.

    (3) Employers must transfer the NMSN to the appropriate group health plan providing any such health care coverage for which the child(ren) is eligible (excluding the severable Notice to Withhold for Health Care Coverage directing the employer to withhold any mandatory employee contributions to the plan) within twenty business days after the date of the NMSN.

    (4) Employers must withhold any obligation of the employee for employee contributions necessary for coverage of the child(ren) and send any amount withheld directly to the plan.

    (5) Employees may contest the withholding based on a mistake of fact. If the employee contests such withholding, the employer must initiate withholding until such time as the employer receives notice that the contest is resolved.

    (6) Employers must notify the State agency promptly whenever the noncustodial parent's and, at State option, custodial parent's employment is terminated in the same manner as required for income withholding cases in accordance with § 303.100(e)(1)(x) of this part.

    (7) The State agency must promptly notify the employer when there is no longer a current order for medical support in effect for which the IV-D agency is responsible.

    (8) The State agency, in consultation with the custodial parent, must promptly select from available plan options when the plan administrator reports that there is more than one option available under the plan.

    (d)  This section is effective October 1, 2001, or, if later, the effective date of State laws described in paragraph (a) of this section. Such State laws must be effective no later than the close of the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins after the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after October 1, 2001. For States with 2-year legislative sessions, each year of such session would be regarded as a separate regular session.

#### § § 303.35

    (a) Each State must have in place an administrative complaint procedure, defined by the State, in place to allow individuals the opportunity to request an administrative review, and take appropriate action when there is evidence that an error has occurred or an action should have been taken on their case. This includes both individuals in the State and individuals from other States.

    (b) A State need not establish a formal hearing process but must have clear procedures in place.

    The State must calculate and promptly pay incentives to political subdivisions as follows:

    (a) The State IV-D agency must develop a standard methodology for passing through an appropriate share of its incentive payment to those political subdivisions of the State that participate in the costs of the program, taking into account the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities carried out under the State plan by those political subdivisions. In order to reward efficiency and effectiveness, the methodology also may provide for payment of incentives to other political subdivisions of the State that administer the program.

    (b) To ensure that the standard methodology developed by the State reflects local participation, the State IV-D agency must submit a draft methodology to participating political subdivisions for review and comment or use the rulemaking process available under State law to receive local input.

    (iii) At State option, the amount has accrued since the State IV-D agency began to enforce the support order; and

    (iv) The State has checked its records to determine if a title IV-A or foster care maintenance assigned arrearage exists with respect to the non-IV-A individual or family.

    (i) A copy of the order and any modifications upon which the amount referred is based which specify the date of issuance and amount of support;

    (ii) A copy of the payment record, or, if there is no payment record, an affidavit signed by the custodial parent attesting to the amount of support owed; and

    (iii) In non-IV-A cases, the custodial parent's current address.

    (5) Before submittal, the State IV-D agency has verified the accuracy of the name and social security number of the noncustodial parent and the accuracy of the past-due support amount. If the State IV-D agency has verified this information previously, it need not reverify it.

    (6) A notification of liability for past-due support has been received by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury as prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (b)  (1) A State IV-D agency shall submit a notification (or notifications) of liability for past-due support to the Office according to the timeframes and in the manner specified by the Office in instructions.

    (2) If a request meets all requirements, the Deputy Director will transmit the request to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and will notify the State IV-D agency of the transmittal.

    (3) If a request does not meet all requirements, the Deputy Director will attempt to correct the request in consultation with the State IV-D agency.

    (4) If a request cannot be corrected through consultation, the Deputy Director will return it to the State IV-D agency with an explanation of why the request could not be transmitted to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.

    (d)  (1) The State referring past-due support for offset must, in interstate situations, notify any other State involved in enforcing the support order when it receives the offset amount from the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.

    (2) The State IV-D agency shall, within timeframes established by the Office in instructions, notify the Deputy Director of any deletion of, or any change in, the arrears balance, if the change is significant according to the guidelines developed by the State. The notification shall contain the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (e) —(1)  The State IV-D agency, or the Office, if the State requests and the Office agrees, shall send a written advance notice to inform a noncustodial parent that the amount of his or her past-due support will be referred to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for collection by Federal tax refund offset. The notice must inform noncustodial parents:

    (i) Of their right to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of past-due support;

    (ii) Of their right to an administrative review by the submitting State or at the noncustodial parent's request the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based;

    (iii) Of the procedures and timeframe for contacting the IV-D agency in the submitting State to request administrative review; and

    (iv) That, in the case of a joint return, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding the steps to take to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to that spouse. If the IV-D agency sends the notice, it must meet the conditions specified by the Office in instructions.

    (2)  The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent that the offset has been made. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will also notify any individual who filed a joint return with the noncustodial parent of the steps to take in order to secure a proper share of the refund.

    (f)  (1) Upon receipt of a complaint from a noncustodial parent in response to the advance notice required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or concerning a tax refund which has already been offset, the IV-D agency must send a notice to the noncustodial parent and, in non-IV-A cases the custodial parent, of the time and place of the administrative review of the complaint and conduct the review to determine the validity of the complaint.

    (2) If the complaint concerns a joint tax refund that has not yet been offset, the IV-D agency must inform the noncustodial parent that the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding the steps to take to secure his or her proper share of the refund. If the complaint concerns a joint tax refund which has already been offset, the IV-D agency must refer the noncustodial parent to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.

    (3) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or change in, the arrears balance, the IV-D agency must notify OCSE within timeframes established by the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (4) If, as a result of the administrative review, an amount which has already been offset is found to have exceeded the amount of past-due support owed, the IV-D agency must take steps to refund the excess amount to the noncustodial parent promptly.

    (g)  (1) If the noncustodial parent requests an administrative review in the submitting State, the IV-D agency must meet the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.

    (2) If the complaint cannot be resolved by the submitting State and the noncustodial parent requests an administrative review in the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based, the submitting State must notify the State with the order of the request for an administrative review and provide that State with all necessary information, including the information listed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, within 10 days of the noncustodial parent's request for an administrative review.

    (3) The State with the order must send a notice to the noncustodial parent and, in non-IV-A cases the custodial parent, of the time and place of the administrative review, conduct the review and make a decision within 45 days of receipt of the notice and information from the submitting State.

    (4) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or change in, the arrears balance, the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based must notify the submitting State within timeframes established by the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The submitting State must then notify the Office within timeframes established by the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (5) Upon resolution of a complaint after an offset has been made, the State with the order must notify the submitting State of its decision promptly.

    (6) When an administrative review is conducted in the State with the order, the submitting State is bound by the decision made by the State with the order.

    (7) Based on the decision of the State with the order, the IV-D agency in the submitting State must take steps to refund any excess amount to the noncustodial parent promptly.

    (8) In computing the arrearage collection performance level under § 305.2(a)(4) of this chapter, if the case is referred to the State with the order for an administrative review, the collections made as a result of Federal tax refund offset will be treated as having been collected in full by both the submitting State and the State with the order.

    (h)  (1) Collections received by the IV-D agency as a result of Federal tax refund offset to satisfy title IV-A or non-IV-A past-due support shall be distributed as required in accordance with section 457 and, effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, in accordance with the option selected under section 454(34) of the Act.

    (2) Collections received by the IV-D agency in foster care maintenance cases shall be distributed as past-due support under § 302.52(b) (3) and (4) of this chapter.

    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii), the IV-D agency must inform individuals receiving services under § 302.33 of this chapter in advance that amounts offset will be applied to satisfy any past-due support which has been assigned to the State and submitted for Federal tax refund offset.

    (ii) Effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, the IV-D agency need no longer meet the requirement for notice under paragraph (h)(3)(i) if the State has opted, under section 454(34) of the Act, to apply amounts submitted to Federal tax refund offset first to satisfy any current support due and past-due support owed to the family.

    (4) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to be distributed under section 457 of the Act, the IV-D agency must repay the excess to the noncustodial parent whose refund was offset or to the parties filing a joint return within a reasonable period in accordance with State law.

    (5) In cases where the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, through OCSE, notifies the State that an offset is being made to satisfy non-IV-A past-due support from a refund based on a joint return, the State may delay distribution until notified that the unobligated spouse's proper share of the refund has been paid or for a period not to exceed six months from notification of offset, whichever is earlier.

    (6) Collections from offset may be applied only to cases that were being enforced by the IV-D agency at the time the advance notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section was sent.

    (i)  (1) A refund offset fee, in such amount as the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have agreed to be sufficient to reimburse the U.S. Department of Treasury for the full cost of the offset procedure, shall be deducted from the offset amount and credited to the U.S. Department of Treasury appropriations which bore all or part of the costs involved in making the collection. The full amount of the offset must be credited against the obligor's payment record. The fee which the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may impose with respect to non-IV-A submittals shall not exceed $25 per submittal.

    (2) The State IV-D agency may charge an individual who is receiving services under § 302.33(a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this chapter a fee not to exceed $25 for submitting past-due support for Federal tax refund offset. The State must inform the individual in advance of the amount of any fee charged.

    (3) Any State which requests the Office to send the advance written notice under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be charged a fee, in an amount established by the Office in instructions, for printing and mailing of pre-offset notices. This fee shall be credited to the Health and Human Services appropriations which bore all or part of the costs involved in making the collection.

    (j) Each State involved in a referral of past-due support for offset must comply with instructions issued by the Office.

    § 303.100   Procedures for income withholding.

#### § § 303.100

    (a)  (1) The State must ensure that in the case of each noncustodial parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the State plan, so much of his or her income as defined in sections 466(b)(1) and (8) of the Act must be withheld, in accordance with this section, as is necessary to comply with the order.

    (2) In addition to the amount to be withheld to pay the current month's obligation, the amount to be withheld must include an amount to be applied toward liquidation of overdue support.

    (3) The total amount to be withheld under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and, if applicable, (f)(1)(iii) of this section may not exceed the maximum amount permitted under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)).

    (4) In the case of a support order being enforced under the State plan, the withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or any other action by the court or entity that issued it other than that required or permitted under this section.

    (5) If there is more than one notice for withholding against a single noncustodial parent, the State must allocate amounts available for withholding giving priority to current support up to the limits imposed under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)). The State must establish procedures for allocation of support among families, but in no case shall the allocation result in a withholding for one of the support obligations not being implemented.

    (6) The withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State.

    (7) The State must have procedures for promptly terminating withholding:

    (i) In all cases, when there is no longer a current order for support and all arrearages have been satisfied; or,

    (ii) At State option, when the noncustodial parent requests termination and withholding has not been terminated previously and subsequently initiated, and the noncustodial parent meets the conditions for an alternative arrangement set forth under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

    (8) The State must have procedures for promptly refunding to noncustodial parents amounts which have been improperly withheld.

    (9) Support orders issued or modified in IV-D cases must include a provision requiring the noncustodial parent to keep the IV-D agency informed of the name and address of his or her current employer, whether the noncustodial parent has access to health insurance coverage at reasonable cost and, if so, the health insurance policy information.

    (b)  (1) In the case of a support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after November 1, 1990, the income of a noncustodial parent shall be subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order, except that such income shall not be subject to withholding under this paragraph in any case where:

    (i) Either the noncustodial or custodial parent demonstrates, and the court or administrative authority finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding; or

    (ii) A written agreement is reached between the absent and custodial parent, and, at State option, the State in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the State, which provides for an alternative arrangement.

    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph, any finding that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding must be based on at least:

    (i) A written determination that, and explanation by the court or administrative authority of why, implementing immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child; and

    (ii) Proof of timely payment of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of support orders.

    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, “written agreement” means a written alternative arrangement signed by both the custodial and noncustodial parent, and, at State option, by the State in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the State, and reviewed and entered in the record by the court or administrative authority.

    (c)  In the case of income not subject to immediate withholding under paragraph (b) of this section, including cases subject to a finding of good cause or to a written agreement:

    (1) The income of the noncustodial parent shall become subject to the withholding on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of:

    (i) The date on which the noncustodial parent requests that withholding begin;

    (ii) The date on which the custodial parent requests that withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved; or

    (iii) Such earlier date as State law or procedure may provide.

    (2) The only basis for contesting a withholding under this paragraph is a mistake of fact, which for purposes of this paragraph means an error in the amount of current or overdue support or in the identity of the alleged noncustodial parent.

    (d)  The State must send a notice to the noncustodial parent regarding the initiated withholding. The notice must inform the noncustodial parent:

    (1) That the withholding has commenced;

    (2) Of the amount of overdue support that is owed, if any, and the amount of wages that will be withheld;

    (3) That the provision for withholding applies to any current or subsequent employer or period of employment;

    (4) Of the procedures available for contesting the withholding and that the only basis for contesting the withholding is a mistake of fact;

    (5) Of the information provided to the employer, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e)  (1) To initiate withholding, the State must send the noncustodial parent's employer a notice using the required OMB-approved  form that includes the following:

    (i) The amount to be withheld from the noncustodial parent's income, and a statement that the amount actually withheld for support and other purposes, including the fee specified under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, may not be in excess of the maximum amounts permitted under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b));

    (ii) That the employer must send the amount to the SDU within 7 business days of the date the noncustodial parent is paid, and must report to the SDU the date on which the amount was withheld from the noncustodial parent's income;

    (iii) That, in addition to the amount withheld for support, the employer may deduct a fee established by the State for administrative costs incurred for each withholding, if the State permits a fee to be deducted;

    (iv) That the withholding is binding upon the employer until further notice by the State;

    (v) That the employer is subject to a fine to be determined under State law for discharging a noncustodial parent from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against any noncustodial parent because of the withholding;

    (vi) That, if the employer fails to withhold income in accordance with the provisions of the notice, the employer is liable for the accumulated amount the employer should have withheld from the noncustodial parent's income;

    (vii) That the withholding under this section shall have priority over any other legal process under State law against the same income;

    (viii) That the employer may combine withheld amounts from noncustodial parents' income in a single payment to each appropriate agency requesting withholding and separately identify the portion of the single payment which is attributable to each individual noncustodial parent;

    (ix) That the employer must withhold from the noncustodial parent's income the amount specified in the notice and pay such amount to the State disbursement unit within 7 business days after the date the income would have been paid to the noncustodial parent.

    (x) That the employer must notify the State promptly when the noncustodial parent terminates employment and provide the noncustodial parent's last known address and the name and address of the noncustodial parent's new employer, if known.

    (2) In the case of an immediate withholding under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must issue the notice to the employer specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section within 2 business days of the date the State's computerized support enforcement system receives notice of income and income source from a court, another State, an employer, the Federal Parent Locator Service, or another source recognized by the State, or the date information regarding a newly hired employee is entered into the State Directory of New Hires, or if information is not received by the State's computerized support enforcement system or its State Directory of New Hires, within 15 calendar days of the date the support order is received if the employer's address is known on that date, or, if the address is unknown on that date, within 2 business days of the date the State's computerized support enforcement system receives notice of income and income source from a court, another State, an employer, the Federal Parent Locator Service, or another source recognized by the State, or the date information regarding a newly hired employee is entered into the State Directory of New Hires, or if information is not received by the State's computerized support enforcement system or its State Directory of New Hires, within 15 calendar days of locating the employer's address.

    (3) In the case of initiated withholding, the State must send the notice to the employer required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section within 2 business days of the date the State's computerized support enforcement system receives notice of income and income source from a court, another State, an employer, the Federal Parent Locator Service, or another source recognized by the State, or the date information regarding a newly hired employee is entered into the State Directory of New Hires, or if information is not received by the State's computerized support enforcement system or its State Directory of New Hires, within 15 calendar days of the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the employer's address is known on that date, or, within 2 business days of the date the State's computerized support enforcement system receives notice of income and income source from a court, another State, an employer, the Federal Parent Locator Service, or another source recognized by the State, or the date information regarding a newly hired employee is entered into the State Directory of New Hires, or if information is not received by the State's computerized support enforcement system or its State Directory of New Hires, within 15 calendar days of locating the employer's address.

    (4) If the noncustodial parent changes employment within the State when a withholding is in effect, the State must notify the noncustodial parent's new employer, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, that the withholding is binding on the new employer.

    (f)  (1) The State law must require employers to comply with a withholding notice issued by any State.

    (2) When an out-of-State IV-D agency requests direct withholding, the employer must be required to withhold funds as directed in the notice but to apply the income withholding laws of the noncustodial parent's principal place of employment to determine:

    (i) The employer's fee for processing the withholding notice;

    (ii) The maximum amount that may be withheld from the noncustodial parent's income;

    (iii) The time periods to implement the withholding notice and to remit the withheld income;

    (iv) The priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees; and

    (v) Any withholding term or conditions not specified in the withholding order.

    (3) In other than direct withholding actions:

    (i) A State may require registration for orders from other States for purposes of enforcement through withholding only if registration is for the sole purpose of obtaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the order; does not confer jurisdiction on the court or agency for any other purpose (such as modification of the underlying or original support order or resolution of custody or visitation disputes); and does not delay implementation of withholding beyond the timeframes established in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.

    (ii) Within 20 calendar days of a determination that withholding is required in a particular case, and, if appropriate, receipt of any information necessary to carry out withholding, the initiating State must notify the IV-D agency of the State in which the noncustodial parent is employed to implement interstate withholding. The notice must contain all information necessary to carry out the withholding, including the amount requested to be withheld, a copy of the support order and a statement of arrearages, if appropriate. If necessary, the State where the support order is entered must provide the information necessary to carry out the withholding within 30 calendar days of receipt of a request for information by the initiating State.

    (iii) The State in which the noncustodial parent is employed must implement withholding in accordance with this section upon receipt of the notice from the initiating State required in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.

    (iv) The State in which the noncustodial parent is employed must notify the State in which the custodial parent is receiving services when the noncustodial parent is no longer employed in the State and provide the name and address of the noncustodial parent and new employer, if known.

    (4) The withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State in which the noncustodial parent is employed.

    (5) Except with respect to when withholding must be implemented which is controlled by the State where the support order was entered, the law and procedures of the State in which the noncustodial parent is employed shall apply.

    (g)  Child support orders issued or modified in the State whether or not being enforced under the State IV-D plan must have a provision for withholding of income. This requirement does not alter the requirement governing all IV-D cases in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that enforcement under the State plan must proceed without the need for a withholding provision in the order.

    (h)  The notice to employers in all child support orders must be on an OMB-approved  form.

    (i)  Income withholding payments made under child support orders initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994 that are not being enforced under the State IV-D plan must be sent to the State Disbursement Unit for disbursement to the family in accordance with sections 454B and 466(a)(8) and (b)(5) of the Act and § 302.32(a) of this chapter.

    (b)  Effective October 1, 1985, the Office shall compute incentive payments for States for a fiscal year in recognition of title IV-A collections and of non-title IV-A collections.

    (1) A portion of a State's incentive payment shall be computed as a percentage of the State's title IV-A collections, and a portion of the incentive payment shall be computed as a percentage of its non-title IV-A collections. The percentages are determined separately for title IV-A and non-title IV-A portions of the incentive. The percentages are based on the ratio of the State's title IV-A collections to the State's total administrative costs and the State's non-title IV-A collections to the State's total administrative costs in accordance with the following schedule:

    (2) The ratios of the State's title IV-A and non-title IV-A collections to total IV-D administrative costs will be truncated at one decimal place.

    (3) The portion of the incentive payment paid to a State for a fiscal year in recognition of its non-title IV-A collections is limited to the percentage of the portion of the incentive payment paid for that fiscal year in recognition of its title IV-A collections, as follows:

    (i) 100 percent in fiscal years 1986 and 1987;

    (ii) 105 percent in fiscal year 1988;

    (iii) 110 percent in fiscal year 1989; and

    (iv) 115 percent in fiscal year 1990 and thereafter.

    (4) In calculating the amount of incentive payments, the following conditions apply:

    (i) Only those title IV-A and non-title IV-A collections distributed and expenditures claimed by the State in the fiscal year shall be used to determine the incentive payment payable for that fiscal year;

    (ii) Support collected by one State on behalf of individuals receiving IV-D services in another State shall be treated as having been collected in full by each State;

    (iii) Fees paid by individuals, recovered costs, and program income such as interest earned on collections shall be deducted from total IV-D administrative costs;

    (iv) At the option of the State, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity may be excluded from total IV-D administrative costs; and

    (v) Effective January 1, 1990, amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project under section 455(e) of the Act shall not be included in the State's total IV-D administrative costs.

    (vi) Costs of demonstration projects for evaluating model procedures for reviewing child support awards under section 103(e) of Public Law 100-485 shall not be included in the State's total IV-D administrative costs.

    (c)  (1) The Office will estimate the total incentive payment that each State will receive for the upcoming fiscal year.

    (2) Each State will include one-quarter of the estimated total payment in its quarterly collection report which will reduce the amount that would otherwise be paid to the Federal government to reimburse its share of assistance payments under §§ 302.51 and 302.52 of this chapter.

    (3) Following the end of a fiscal year, the Office will calculate the actual incentive payment the State should have received based on the reports submitted for that fiscal year. If adjustments to the estimate made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are necessary, the State's IV-A grant award will be reduced or increased because of over- or under-estimates for prior quarters and for other adjustments.

    § 304.40   Repayment of Federal funds by installments.

#### § § 304.40

    (a)  When a State has been reimbursed Federal funds for expenditures claimed under title IV-D, which is later determined to be unallowable for Federal financial participation, the State may make repayment of such Federal funds in installments provided:

    (1) The amount of the repayment exceeds 2  percent of the estimated annual State share of expenditures for the IV-D program as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and

    (2) The State has notified the OCSE Regional Office in a record of its intent to make installment repayments. Such notice must be given prior to the time repayment of the total was otherwise due.

    (b)  (1) The number of quarters over which the repayment of the total unallowable expenditures will be made will be determined by the percentage the total of such repayment is of the estimated State share of the annual expenditures for the IV-D program as follows:

    (2) The latest required financial reports submitted by the State shall be used to estimatethe State's share of annual expenditures for the IV-D program. That estimated share shall be the sum of the State's share of the estimates for four quarters, beginning with the quarter in which the first installment is to be paid.

    (3) In case of termination of the program, the actual State share—rather than the estimate—shall be used for determining whether the amount of the repayment exceeds 2  percent of the annual State share for the IV-D program. The annual State share in these cases will be determined using payments computable for Federal funding as reported for the program by the State on its Quarterly Report of Expenditures and Estimates submitted for the last four quarters preceding the date on which the program was terminated.

    (4) Repayment shall be accomplished through adjustment in the quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment schedule.

    (5) The amount of the repayment for purpose of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may not include any amount previously approved for installment repayment.

    (6) The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of the estimated State share of annual expenditures.

    (7) The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under this provision the State may choose to:

    (i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, in fact, been offset; or

    (ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt (remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option would result in a shorter payment period.

    § 305.1   Definitions.

#### § § 305.1

    The definitions found in § 301.1 of this chapter are also applicable to this part. In addition, for purposes of this part:

    (a) The term  means a parent (mother, father, or putative father) who is now or eventually may be obligated under law for the support of a child or children receiving services under the title IV-D program. A parent is a separate _IV-D case_ for each family with a dependent child or children that the parent may be obligated to support. If both parents are absent and liable or potentially liable for support of a child or children receiving services under the IV-D program, each parent is considered a separate IV-D case. In counting cases for the purposes of this part, States may exclude cases closed under § 303.11 and cases over which the State has no jurisdiction. Lack of jurisdiction cases are those in which a non-custodial parent resides in the civil jurisdictional boundaries of another country or federally recognized Indian Tribe and no income or assets of this individual are located or derived from outside that jurisdiction and the State has no other means through which to enforce the order.

    (b) The term  means collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals whose rights to support are required to be assigned to the State under title IV-A of the Act, under title IV-E of the Act, or under title XIX of the Act. In addition, a referral to the State's IV-D agency must have been made.

    (c) The term  means collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals whose rights to support were formerly required to be assigned to the State under title IV-A (TANF or Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC), title IV-E (Foster Care), or title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act.

    (d) The term  means all other collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals who are receiving child support enforcement services under title IV-D of the Act.

    (e) The term  means total IV-D administrative expenditures claimed by a State in a specified fiscal year adjusted in accordance with § 305.32 of this part.

    (f) The term  means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. The CPI for a fiscal year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of the fiscal year.

    (g) The term  means the incentive base amount for the State for the fiscal year divided by the sum of the incentive base amounts for all of the States for the fiscal year.

    (h) The term  means the sum of the State's performance level percentages (determined in accordance with § 305.33) multiplied by the State's corresponding maximum incentive base on each of the following measures:

    (1) The paternity establishment performance level;

    (2) The support order performance level;

    (3) The current collections performance level;

    (4) The arrears collections performance level; and

    (5) the cost-effectiveness performance level.

    (i) The term  means the most recent data available which are found by the Secretary to be reliable and is a state that exists when data are sufficiently complete and error free to be convincing for their purpose and context. State data must meet a 95 percent standard of reliability effective beginning in fiscal year 2001. This is with the recognition that data may contain errors as long as they are not of a magnitude that would cause a reasonable person, aware of the errors, to doubt a finding or conclusion based on the data.

    (j) The term  means all reporting elements from OCSE reporting forms, necessary to compute a State's performance levels, incentive base amount, and maximum incentive base amount, have been provided within timeframes established in instructions to these forms and § 305.32(f) of this part.

    § 305.2   Performance measures.

#### § § 305.2

    (a) The child support incentive system measures State performance levels in five program areas:

    Paternity establishment; support order establishment; current collections; arrearage collections; and cost-effectiveness. The penalty system measures State performance in three of these areas: Paternity establishment; establishment of support orders; and current collections.

    (1)  States have the choice of being evaluated on one of the following two measures for their paternity establishment percentage (commonly known as the PEP). The count of children shall not include any child who is a dependent by reason of the death of a parent (unless paternity is established for that child). It shall also not include any child whose parent is found to have good cause for refusing to cooperate with the State agency in establishing paternity, or for whom the State agency determines it is against the best interest of the child to pursue paternity issues.

    (i)  means the ratio that the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the fiscal year (or, at the option of the State, as of the end of the fiscal year) who have been born out-of-wedlock and for whom paternity has been established or acknowledged, bears to the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding fiscal year who were born out-of-wedlock. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):

    (ii)  means the ratio that the total number of minor children who have been born out-of-wedlock and for whom paternity has been established or acknowledged during the fiscal year, bears to the total number of children born out-of-wedlock during the preceding fiscal year. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):

    (2)  This measure requires a determination of whether or not there is a support order for each case. These support orders include all types of legally enforceable orders, such as court, default, and administrative. Since the measure is a case count at a point-in-time, modifications to an order do not affect the count. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):

    (3)  Current support is money applied to current support obligations and does not include payment plans for payment towards arrears. If included, voluntary collections must be included in both the numerator and the denominator. This measure is computed monthly and the total of all months is reported at the end of the year. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):

    (4)  This measure includes those cases where all of the past-due support was disbursed to the family, or retained by the State because all the support was assigned to the State. If some of the past-due support was assigned to the State and some was to be disbursed to the family, only those cases where some of the support actually went to the family can be included. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):

    (5)  Interstate incoming and outgoing distributed collections will be included for both the initiating and the responding State in this measure. The equation to compute this measure is as follows (expressed as a ratio):

    (b) For incentive purposes, the measures will be weighted in the following manner. Each State will earn five scores based on performance on each of the five measures. Each of the first three measures (paternity establishment, order establishment, and current collections) earn 100 percent of the collections base as defined in § 305.31(e) of this part. The last two measures (collections on arrears and cost-effectiveness) earn a maximum of 75 percent of the collections base as defined in § 305.31(e) of this part.

    § 305.31   Amount of incentive payment.

#### § § 305.31

    (a) The incentive payment for a State for a fiscal year is equal to the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year, multiplied by the State incentive payment share for the fiscal year.

    (b) The incentive payment pool is:

    (1) $422,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;

    (2) $429,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;

    (3) $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;

    (4) $461,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;

    (5) $454,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;

    (6) $446,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;

    (7) $458,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;

    (8) $471,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;

    (9) $483,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and

    (10) For any succeeding fiscal year, the amount of the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year that precedes such succeeding fiscal year multiplied by the percentage (if any) by which the CPI for such preceding fiscal year exceeds the CPI for the second preceding fiscal year. In other words, for each fiscal year following fiscal year 2008, the incentive payment pool will be multiplied by the percentage increase in the CPI between the two preceding years. For example, if the CPI increases by 1 percent between fiscal years 2007 and 2008, then the incentive pool for fiscal year 2009 would be a 1 percent increase over the $483,000,000 incentive payment pool for fiscal year 2008, or $487,830,000.

    (c) The State incentive payment share for a fiscal year is the incentive base amount for the State for the fiscal year divided by the sum of the incentive base amounts for all of the States for the fiscal year.

    (d) A State's maximum incentive base amount for a fiscal year is the State's collections base for the fiscal year for the paternity establishment, support order, and current collections performance measures and 75 percent of the State's collections base for the fiscal year for the arrearage collections and cost-effectiveness performance measures.

    (e) A State's maximum incentive base amount for a State for a fiscal year is zero, unless a Federal audit performed under § 305.60 of this part determines that the data submitted by the State for the fiscal year and used to determine the performance level involved are complete and reliable.

    (f) A State's collections base for a fiscal year is equal to: two times the sum of the total amount of support collected for Current Assistance cases plus two times the total amount of support collected in Former Assistance cases, plus the total amount of support collected in Never Assistance/other cases during the fiscal year, that is: 2(Current Assistance collections + Former Assistance collections) + all other collections.

    § 305.32   Requirements applicable to calculations.

#### § § 305.32

    In calculating the amount of incentive payments or penalties, the following conditions apply:

    (a) Each measure is based on data submitted for the Federal fiscal year. The Federal fiscal year runs from October 1st of one year through September 30th of the following year.

    (b) Only those Current Assistance, Former Assistance and Never Assistance/other collections disbursed and those expenditures claimed by the State in the fiscal year will be used to determine the incentive payment payable for that fiscal year;

    (c) Support collected by one State at the request of another State will be treated as having been collected in full by each State;

    (d) Amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project under section 455(e) of the Act will be excluded from the State's total IV-D dollars expended in computing incentive payments;

    (e) Fees paid by individuals, recovered costs, and program income such as interest earned on collections will be deducted from total IV-D dollars expended; and

    (f) States must submit data used to determine incentives and penalties following instructions and formats as required by HHS on Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved reporting instruments. Data necessary to calculate performance for incentives and penalties for a fiscal year must be submitted to the Office of Child Support Enforcement by December 31st, the end of the first quarter after the end of the fiscal year. Only data submitted as of December 31st will be used to determine the State's performance for the prior fiscal year and the amount of incentive payments due the States.

    § 305.33   Determination of applicable percentages based on performance levels.

#### § § 305.33

    (a) A State's paternity establishment performance level for a fiscal year is, at the option of the State, the IV-D paternity establishment percentage or the Statewide paternity establishment percentage determined under § 305.2 of this part. The applicable percentage for each level of a State's paternity establishment performance can be found in table 1 of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b) If the State's paternity establishment performance level for a fiscal year is less than 50 percent, but exceeds its paternity establishment performance level for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 10 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage for the paternity establishment performance level is 50 percent.

    (c) A State's support order establishment performance level for a fiscal year is the percentage of the total number of cases where there is a support order determined under §§ 305.2 and 305.32 of this part. The applicable percentage for each level of a State's support order establishment performance can be found on table 1 of this part, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

    (d) If the State's support order establishment performance level for a fiscal year is less than 50 percent, but exceeds the State's support order establishment performance level for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 5 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage is 50 percent.

    (e) A State's current collections performance level for a fiscal year is equal to the total amount of current support collected during the fiscal year divided by the total amount of current support owed during the fiscal year in all IV-D cases, determined under §§ 305.2 and 305.32 of this part. The applicable percentage with respect to a State's current collections performance level can be found on table 2, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

    (f) If the State's current collections performance level for a fiscal year is less than 40 percent but exceeds the current collections performance level of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 5 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage is 50 percent.

    (g) A State's arrearage collections performance level for a fiscal year is equal to the total number of IV-D cases in which payments of past-due child support were received and distributed during the fiscal year, divided by the total number of IV-D cases in which there was past-due child support owed, as determined under §§ 305.2 and 305.32 of this part. The applicable percentage with respect to a State's arrearage collections performance level can be found on table 2 except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.

    (h) If the State's arrearage collections performance level for a fiscal year is less than 40 percent but exceeds the arrearage collections performance level for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 5 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage is 50 percent.

    (i) A State's cost-effectiveness performance level for a fiscal year is equal to the total amount of IV-D support collected and disbursed or retained, as applicable during the fiscal year, divided by the total amount expended during the fiscal year, as determined under §§ 305.2 and 305.32 of this part. The applicable percentage with respect to a State's cost-effectiveness performance level can be found on table 3.

    § 305.34   Payment of incentives.

#### § § 305.34

    (a) Each State must report one-fourth of its estimated annual incentive payment on each of its four quarterly collections' reports for a fiscal year. When combined with the amounts claimed on each of the State's four quarterly expenditure reports, the portion of the annual estimated incentive payment as reported each quarter will be included in the calculation of the next quarterly grant awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act.

    (b) Following the end of each fiscal year, HHS will calculate the State's annual incentive payment, using the actual collection and expenditure data and the performance data submitted by December 31st by the State and other States for that fiscal year. A positive or negative grant will then be awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act to reconcile an actual annual incentive payment that has been calculated to be greater or lesser, respectively, than the annual incentive payment estimated prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.

    (c) Payment of incentives is contingent on a State's data being determined complete and reliable by Federal auditors.

    § 305.35   Reinvestment.

#### § § 305.35

    (a) A State must expend the full amount of incentive payments received under this part to supplement, and not supplant, other funds used by the State to carry out IV-D program activities or funds for other activities approved by the Secretary which may contribute to improving the effectiveness or efficiency of the State's IV-D program, including cost-effective contracts with local agencies, whether or not the expenditures for the activity are eligible for reimbursement under this part.

    (b) In those States in which incentive payments are passed through to political subdivisions or localities, such payments must be used in accordance with this section.

    (c) State IV-D expenditures may not be reduced as a result of the receipt and reinvestment of incentive payments.

    (d) A base amount will be determined by subtracting the amount of incentive funds received and reinvested in the State IV-D program for fiscal year 1998 from the total amount expended by the State in the IV-D program during the same period. Alternatively, States have an option of using the average amount of the previous three fiscal years (1996, 1997, and 1998) as a base amount. This base amount of State spending must be maintained in future years. Incentive payments under this part must be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, the base amount. Non-compliance will result in disallowances of incentive amounts equal to the amount of funds supplanted.

    (e) Using the Form OCSE-396, “Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Financial Report,” the State Current Spending Level will be calculated by determining the State Share of Total Expenditures Claimed for all four quarters of the fiscal year minus State Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for all four quarters of the fiscal year, plus the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) fees for all four quarters of the fiscal year.

    (1) The State Share of Expenditures Claimed is: Total Expenditures Claimed for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter Adjustments minus the Federal Share of Total Expenditures Claimed for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter Adjustments claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.

    (2) The State Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments is: IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter Adjustments minus the Federal Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter Adjustments claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.

    (3) The Fees for the Use of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) can be computed by adding the FPLS fees claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.

    (f) Requests for approval of expending incentives on activities not currently eligible for funding under the IV-D program, but which would benefit the IV-D program, must be submitted in accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner of the Office of Child Support Enforcement.

> [65 FR 82208, Dec. 27, 2000, as amended at 81 FR 93568, Dec. 20, 2016]

    § 305.40   Penalty performance measures and levels.

#### § § 305.40

    (a) There are three performance measures for which States must achieve certain levels of performance in order to avoid being penalized for poor performance. These measures are the paternity establishment, support order establishment, and current collections measures set forth in § 305.2 of this part. The levels the State must meet are:

    (1)  which is required under section 452(g) of the Act for penalty purposes. States have the option of using either the IV-D paternity establishment percentage or the statewide paternity establishment percentage defined in § 305.2 of this part. Table 4 shows the level of performance at which a State will be subject to a penalty under the paternity establishment measure.

    (2) The support order establishment performance measure is set forth in § 305.2 of this part. For purposes of the penalty with respect to this measure, there is a threshold of 40 percent, below which a State will be penalized unless an increase of 5 percent over the previous year is achieved—which will qualify it for an incentive. Performance in the 40 percent to 49 percent range with no significant increase will not be penalized but neither will it qualify for an incentive payment. Table 5 shows at which level of performance a State will incur a penalty under the child support order establishment measure.

    (3) The  performance measure is set forth in § 305.2 of this part. There is a threshold of 35 percent below which a State will be penalized unless an increase of 5 percent over the previous year is achieved (that qualifies it for an incentive). Performance in the 35 percent to 40 percent range with no significant increase will not be penalized but neither will it qualify for an incentive payment. Table 6 shows at which level of performance the State will incur a penalty under the _current collections_ measure.

    (b) The provisions listed under § 305.32 of this part also apply to the penalty performance measures.

    § 305.42   Penalty phase-in.

#### § § 305.42

    States are subject to the performance penalties described in § 305.40 based on data reported for FY 2001. Data reported for FY 2000 will be used as a base year to determine improvements in performance during FY 2001. There will be an automatic one-year corrective action period before any penalty is assessed. The penalties will be assessed and then suspended during the corrective action period.

    § 305.60   Types and scope of Federal audits.

#### § § 305.60

    (a) OCSE will conduct audits, at least once every three years (or more frequently if the State fails to meet performance standards and reliability of data requirements) to assess the completeness, authenticity, reliability, accuracy and security of data and the systems used to process the data in calculating performance indicators under this part;

    (b) Also, OCSE will conduct audits to determine the adequacy of financial management of the State IV-D program, including assessments of:

    (1) Whether funds to carry out the State program are being appropriately expended, and are properly and fully accounted for; and

    (2) Whether collections and disbursements of support payments are carried out correctly and are fully accounted for; and

    (c) OCSE will conduct audits for such other purposes as the Secretary may find necessary.

    (1) These audits include audits to determine if the State is substantially complying with one or more of the requirements of the IV-D program (with the exception of the requirements of section 454(24) of the Act relating to statewide-automated systems and section 454(27)(A) and (B)(i) relating to the State Disbursement Unit) as defined in § 305.63 of this part. Other audits will be conducted at the discretion of OCSE.

    (2) Audits to determine substantial compliance will be initiated based on substantiated evidence of a failure by the State to meet IV-D program requirements. Evidence, which could warrant an audit to determine substantial compliance, includes:

    (i) The results of two or more State self-reviews conducted under section 454(15)(A) of the Act which: Show evidence of sustained poor performance; or indicate that the State has not corrected deficiencies identified in previous self-assessments, or that those deficiencies are determined to seriously impact the performance of the State's program; or

    (ii) Evidence of a State program's systemic failure to provide adequate services under the program through a pattern of non-compliance over time.

    (d) OCSE will conduct audits of the State's IV-D program through inspection, inquiries, observation, and confirmation and in accordance with standards promulgated by the Comptroller General of the United States in “Government Auditing Standards.”

    § 305.61   Penalty for failure to meet IV-D requirements.

#### § § 305.61

    (a) A State will be subject to a financial penalty and the amounts otherwise payable to the State under title IV-A of the Act will be reduced in accordance with § 305.66:

    (1) If on the basis of:

    (i) Data submitted by the State or the results of an audit conducted under § 305.60 of this part, the State's program failed to achieve the paternity establishment percentages, as defined in section 452(g)(2) of the Act and § 305.40 of this part, or to meet the support order establishment and current collections performance measures as set forth in § 305.40 of this part; or

    (ii) The results of an audit under § 305.60 of this part, the State did not submit complete and reliable data, as defined in § 305.1 of the part; or

    (iii) The results of an audit under § 305.60 of this part, the State failed to substantially comply with one or more of the requirements of the IV-D program, as defined in § 305.63; and

    (2) With respect to the immediately succeeding fiscal year, the State failed to take sufficient corrective action to achieve the appropriate performance levels or compliance or the data submitted by the State are still incomplete and unreliable.

    (b) The reductions under paragraph (c) of this section will be made for quarters following the end of the corrective action year and will continue until the end of the first quarter throughout which the State, as appropriate:

    (1) Has achieved the paternity establishment percentages, the order establishment or the current collections performance measures set forth in § 305.40 of this part;

    (2) Is in substantial compliance with IV-D requirements as defined in § 305.63 of this part; or

    (3) Has submitted data that are determined to be complete and reliable.

    (c) The payments for a fiscal year under title IV-A of the Act will be reduced by the following percentages:

    (1) One to two percent for the first finding under paragraph (a) of this section;

    (2) Two to three percent for the second consecutive finding; and

    (3) Not less than three percent and not more than 5 percent for the third or a subsequent consecutive finding.

    (d) The reduction will be made in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 262.1(b)-(e) and 262.7.

    (e)  Due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on State IV-D operations, the criteria by which States are subject to financial penalties for the paternity establishment percentage under paragraph (a) of this section are modified for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022, in accordance with section 452(g)(A) of the Act, as follows:

    (1) The acceptable level of paternity establishment percentage performance under § 305.40(a)(1) is modified for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 from 90 percent to 50 percent, and

    (2) The adverse findings of data reliability audits of a State's paternity establishment data under § 305.60 will not result in a financial penalty for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

    (f) During, and subsequent to, natural disasters and other calamities (e.g., state chief executive officer-declared states of emergency, pandemics, events designated by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170), and declared public health emergencies under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d), the Secretary may temporarily modify the performance measure requirements for a state to meet the paternity establishment percentage standard of 90 percent under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.40(a)(1), the support order establishment standard of 40 percent under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(2), and the current collections standard of 35 percent under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(3), to lower levels to avoid imposing financial performance penalties on states, and may set aside adverse data reliability audit findings under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.61(a)(1)(ii) during the same time period. For Federal fiscal years subsequent to September 30, 2022, the performance requirements for paternity establishment under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.40(a)(1), for support order establishment under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(2), and for current collections under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(3)—may be modified by the Secretary to a lower level under the conditions described in this section.

    (1) If a state experiences a natural disaster or other calamity (e.g., state chief Executive officer-declared states of emergency, pandemics, events designated by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170), and declared public health emergencies under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d), the state's chief executive officer (or his or her designee) may submit to the Secretary a request to modify one or more of the performance requirements specified under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.40(a)(1), under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(2), or under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(3).

    (2) The state may also ask the Secretary to set aside adverse data reliability audit findings under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.61(a)(1)(ii) for the same time period as the time period for which a modification of performance requirements is sought.

    (3) The request for a modification to the performance requirements must be submitted in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(4), (5) and (6) of this section. Any request other than one submitted with the initial application must be submitted as soon as the adverse effect of the natural disaster or other calamity giving rise to the request is known to the state.

    (4) A request for a modification of one or more of the performance requirements must include the following:

    (i) A narrative statement describing the circumstances and justification for the request to modify the state's performance requirement;

    (ii) Information substantiating the impact of the natural disaster or other calamity on the state's ability to comply with the standards, including a description of the specific conditions caused by the natural disaster or other calamity that have, or may have, a significant impact on the state's ability to comply, and preliminary data provided by the state, as required under 45 CFR 305.32(f), showing reduced performance;

    (iii) Information on the expected duration of the conditions that make compliance impracticable; and

    (iv) Any other documentation or other information that the Secretary may require to make this determination.

    (5) The state must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the natural disaster or other calamity has directly resulted in a reduction in performance or is expected to result in a reduction in performance, based on data provided by the state. In its request for a temporary modification to one or more performance requirements, the state must be able to demonstrate that it:

    (i) Has not, or may not meet one or more existing performance requirements, such that a performance penalty would apply;

    (ii) Has submitted preliminary data supporting this statement; and

    (iii) Has provided all required information requested by the Secretary.

    (6) The Secretary shall provide written communication of the decision to modify or decline to modify the performance standards, and the period for which any modified standards shall apply, within 30-calendar days after receipt of appropriate written communication from the chief executive officer.

    (i) If approved, a temporary modification in a performance requirement will expire on the last day of the Federal fiscal year for which it was approved.

    (ii) Adverse findings of data reliability audits of the state's performance data under 45 CFR 305.60 as reported during the period in which the performance requirement modification is approved will not result in a financial penalty pursuant to the state's request as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

    (iii) Unless the state receives a written approval of its performance requirement modification request, the performance requirements under section 452(g) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)) and 45 CFR 305.40(a)(1), under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(2), and under 45 CFR 305.40(a)(3) remain in effect.

    (iv) If the request for a performance requirement modification is denied, the denial is not subject to administrative appeal.

#### § § 305.66

    (a) If a State is found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty as described in § 305.61, the OCSE will notify the State, in a record, of such finding.

    (b) The notice will:

    (1) Explain the deficiency or deficiencies which result in the State being subject to a penalty, indicate the amount of the potential penalty, and give reasons for the finding; and

    (2) Specify that the penalty will be assessed in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 262.1(b) through (e) and 262.7 if the State is found to have failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice during the automatic corrective action year (i.e., the succeeding fiscal year following the year with respect to which the deficiency occurred.)

    (c) The penalty under § 305.61 of this part will be assessed if the Secretary determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice by the end of the corrective action year.

    (d) Only one corrective action period is provided to a State with respect to a given deficiency where consecutive findings of noncompliance are made with respect to that deficiency. In the case of a State against which the penalty is assessed and which failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice by the end of the corrective action year, the penalty will be effective for any quarter after the end of the corrective action year and ends for the first full quarter throughout which the State IV-D program is determined to have corrected the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice.

    (e) A consecutive finding occurs only when the State does not meet the same criterion or criteria cited in the notice in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b)  A State may apply for a waiver of any functional requirement in § 307.10, or § 307.11 by presenting a plan for an alternative system configuration, or a waiver of any conditions for APD approval in § 307.15(b) by presenting an alternative approach. Waiver requests must be submitted and approved as part of the State's APD or APD update.

    (c)  The Secretary may grant a State a waiver if:

    (1) The State demonstrates that it has an alternative approach to the APD requirements or an alternative system configuration that enables the State, in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, to be in substantial compliance with the other requirements of this chapter; and either:

    (2) The waiver request meets the criteria set forth in section 1115(c) (1), (2) and (3) of the Act; or

    (3) The State provides assurance, which is reflected in a record, that steps will be taken to otherwise improve the State's Child Support Enforcement program.

    (d)  APDs submitted by States which include requests for waiver for an alternative system configuration must, in addition to meeting conditions of § 307.15(b):

    (1) Describe the State's base system;

    (2) Include a detailed description of the separate automated or manual processes the State plans to use and how they will interface with the base system;

    (3) Provide documentation that the alternative system configuration will enable the State to be in substantial compliance with title IV-D of the Act in accordance with section 403(h) of the Act and implementing regulations. In addition, if the State is subject to a Notice under § 305.66 of this part that it did not substantially comply with one or more of the requirements of title IV-D of the Act, at the time a waiver request is submitted, the State must:

    (i) Demonstrate that the deficiency is not related to or caused by the performance of the system; or

    (ii) Specify the corrective action taken to modify the system if the system contributed to the deficiency.

    (e)  APDs submitted by States which include requests for waiver of conditions for APD approval in § 307.15(b) must demonstrate why meeting the conditions is unnecessary or inappropriate.

    (f)  (1) The Office will review waiver requests to assure that all necessary information is provided, that all processes provide for effective and efficient program operation, and that the conditions for waiver in paragraph (d) of this section are met.

    (2) When a waiver is approved, it becomes part of the State's approved APD. A waiver is subject to the APD suspension provisions in § 307.40.

    (3) When a waiver is disapproved, the APD will be disapproved. The APD disapproval is a final administrative decision and is not subject to administrative appeal.

    (g)  (1) The provisions of §§ 307.30 and 307.35 apply to requests for FFP for costs of computerized support enforcement systems.

    (2) FFP for alternative system configurations is further limited as follows:

    (i) FFP is available at the enhanced matching rate for development of the base system and for hardware, operational system software, and electronic linkages with the separate components of an alternative system configuration.

    (ii) FFP is available at the applicable matching rate for minor alterations to the separate automated or manual processes that are part of an alternative system configuration and for operating costs including hardware, operational software and applications software of a computerized support enforcement system.

    (iii) FFP is not available for developing new systems or making major changes and enhancements to separate automated or manual processes so that alternative system configurations meet conditions for waiver.

      (d)  If there is no assignment of support rights to the Tribe as a condition of receipt of Tribal TANF and the Tribal IV-D agency has received a request for assistance in collecting support on behalf of the family from a State or another Tribal IV-D agency under § 309.120 of this part, the Tribal IV-D agency must send all support collected to either the State IV-D agency for distribution in accordance with section 457 of the Act and 45 CFR 302.51 and 302.52, or to the Tribal IV-D agency for distribution under this section, as appropriate, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (e)  Any collections received based on Federal income tax refund offset under section 464 of the Act and distributed by the Tribal IV-D agency must be applied to satisfy child support arrearages.

      (f)  Rather than send collections to a State or another Tribal IV-D agency for distribution as required under § 309.115 (b)(2), (c)(2) and (d), a Tribal IV-D agency may contact the requesting State IV-D agency to determine appropriate distribution under section 457 of the Act, or the other Tribal IV-D agency to determine appropriate distribution under this section, and distribute collections as directed by the other agency.
