      Subpart 452.2—Texts of Provisions and Clauses

        452.204-70   Modification for Contract Closeout.

#### § 452.204-70

        As prescribed in AGAR 404.804, 413.302-5, and 416.102, insert the following clause:

        “Upon contract closeout for contracts utilizing anything other than cost reimbursement:

        (a) If unliquidated funds in the amount of $1000 or less remain on the contract, the Contracting Officer (CO) shall issue a unilateral modification for deobligation. The contractor will receive a copy of the modification but will not be required to provide a signature. The CO shall immediately proceed with contract closeout upon completion of the period of performance, receipt and acceptance of supplies or services, and final payment.

        (b) Upon contract closeout for contracts utilizing SAP: if unliquidated funds of more than $1000 remain on the contract, the CO shall issue a bilateral modification for deobligation. The contractor will receive a copy of the modification and will be required to provide a signature. (The CO may also request a “Contractor Release of Claims” be completed by the contractor, although not required for contracts and orders using SAP.) If the bilateral modification and Release of Claims are not returned to the CO within 60 days, the CO shall release the modification as unilateral and proceed with contract closeout upon completion of the period of performance, receipt and acceptance of supplies or services, and final payment.

        (c) Upon contract closeout for contracts utilizing anything other than cost reimbursement, if unliquidated funds of more than $1000 remain on the contract, the CO shall issue a bilateral modification for deobligation. The contractor will receive a copy of the modification and a “Contractor Release of Claims” and will be required to provide a signature on both forms. If the bilateral modification and Release of Claims are not returned to the CO within 120 days, the CO shall release the modification as unilateral and proceed with contract closeout upon completion of the period of performance, receipt and acceptance of supplies or services, and final payment.

        452.204-71   Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Employees.

#### § 452.204-71

        As prescribed in AGAR 404.1303, insert the following clause:

        (a) The contractor shall comply with the personal identity verification (PIV) policies and procedures established by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Directives 4620-002 series.

        (b) Should the USDA Directives 4620-002 require the exclusion of a contractor's employee, the contracting officer will notify the contractor in writing. The contractor must appoint a representative to manage compliance with the PIV policies established by the USDA Directives 4620-002 and to maintain a list of employees eligible for a USDA LincPass required for performance of the work.

        (c) The responsibility of maintaining a sufficient workforce remains with the contractor. Contractor employees may be barred by the Government from performance of work should they be found ineligible or to have lost eligibility for a USDA LincPass. Failure to maintain a sufficient workforce of employees eligible for a USDA LincPass may be grounds for termination of the contract.

        (d) The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine unaccompanied physical access to a Federally controlled facility and/or routine unaccompanied access to a Federally controlled information system.

        (e) The PIV Sponsor for this contract is a designated program point of contact, which in most cases is the COR, unless otherwise specified in this contract. The PIV Sponsor will be available to receive contractor identity information from [hours and days to be added by CO] to [hours and days to be added by CO] at [office address for registration to be added by CO]. The Government will notify the contractor if there is a change in the PIV Sponsor, the office address, or the office hours for registration; however, it is the contractor's responsibility to meet all aspects of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e).

        452.232-70   Limitation of Government's Obligation.

#### § 452.232-70

        As prescribed in AGAR 432.703, insert the following clause:

        (a) Contract line item(s) listed below is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $ [Contracting Officer insert after negotiations] of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract.

        An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) below.

        (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) as not fully funded, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement of costs in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor more than the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government”. The total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).

        (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j), the Contractor will notify the contracting officer in writing at least [30, 60, or 90, as appropriate] days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount currently allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j), or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the contracting officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the contracting officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government”.

        (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) above, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) will apply similarly to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.

        (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a), the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”

        (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) above.

        (g) The termination provisions do not limit the rights of the Government under the clauses entitled “Default” and “Termination for Cause”. The provisions are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) above. These terms no longer apply once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (e) and (f) above.

        (h) Nothing herein affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government”.

        (i) Nothing herein shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

        (j) The parties agree that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:

        452.236-70   Emergency Response, Fire Suppression, and Liability.

#### § 452.236-70

        As prescribed in AGAR 436.570, the following clause shall be used in Forest Service Integrated Resource Service Contracts (IRSCs), and is optional for non-IRSCs:

        (a)  When directed by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall allow the Government to temporarily use employees and equipment from the work site for emergency work (anticipated to be restricted to firefighting). This is considered to be within the general scope of the contract. An equitable adjustment for the temporary use of employees and equipment will be made under the CHANGES clause, FAR 52.243-4.

        (b)  The Contractor, under the provisions of FAR 52.236-9, Protection of Existing Vegetation, Structures, Equipment, Utilities, and Improvements, shall immediately extinguish all fires on the work site other than those fires in use as a part of the work. The Contractor may be held liable for all damages and for all costs incurred by the Government for labor, subsistence, equipment, supplies, and transportation deemed necessary to control or suppress a fire set or caused by the Contractor or the Contractor's agents, subcontractors, or employees subject to the fire classifications listed in subsection (c).

        (c)  The Contractor's obligations for cost of fire suppression vary according to three classifications of fires as follows:

        (1)  An “operations fire” is a fire caused by the Contractor's operations other than a negligent fire. The Contractor agrees to reimburse the Forest Service for such cost for each operations fire, subject to a maximum dollar amount of [Contracting Officer insert amount]. The cost of the Contractor's actions, supplies, and equipment expended or used on suppressing any such fire, or otherwise provided at the request of Forest Service, shall be credited toward such maximum. If the Contractor's actual cost exceeds the contractor's maximum obligation stated above, the Forest Service shall reimburse the contractor for the excess.

        (2)  A “negligent fire” is a fire caused by the negligence or fault of the Contractor's operations including, but not limited to, one caused by smoking by persons engaged in the Contractor's operations during the course of their employment, or during rest or lunch periods; or if the Contractor's failure to comply with requirements under this contract results in a fire starting or permits a fire to spread. Damages and the cost of suppressing negligent fires shall be borne by the Contractor.

        (3)  The Forest Service shall pay the Contractor, at firefighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates, for equipment or personnel furnished by the Contractor at the request of the Forest Service, on any fire on the contract area other than an operations fire or a negligent fire.

        (d)  The Contractor shall immediately notify the Government of any fires sighted on or in the vicinity of the work site.

        (e)  Where the Contractor's employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or their employees or agents perform the Contractor's operations in connection with fire responsibilities, the Contractor's obligations shall be the same as if performance was by the Contractor.

        (f)  The Contractor shall not be relieved by the terms of this contract of any liability to the United States for fire suppression costs recovered in an action based on State law, except for such costs resulting from operations fires. Amounts due to the Contractor for firefighting expenditures on operations fires shall not be withheld pending settlement of any such claim or action based on State law.

      (b)  To the maximum extent possible, the use of electronic submission of solicitation-related documents shall be used with respect to the acquisition of agricultural commodities and related freight. However, to the extent that a solicitation allows for the submission in paper or hard copy format in addition to information in an electronic format and there is a discrepancy in such submissions, the information submitted in paper or hard copy format shall prevail unless the electronic submission states that a specific existing written term is superseded by the electronic submission.

      (c)  With respect to the acquisition of freight for the shipment of agricultural commodities and products of agricultural commodities, the provisions of the FAR, including part 47, shall be utilized as applicable and various types of services to be obtained may include multi-trip voyage charters.

      470.103   United States origin of agricultural products.

#### § 470.103

      (a)  As provided by 7 U.S.C. 1732(2) and 1736o-1(a) commodities and the products of agricultural commodities acquired for use in international feeding and development programs shall be products of United States origin. A product shall not be considered to be a product of the United States if it contains any ingredient that is not produced in the United States if that ingredient is:

      (1) Produced in the United States; and

      (2) Commercially available in the United States at fair and reasonable prices from domestic sources.

      (b)  Commodities and the products of agricultural commodities acquired by USDA for use in domestic food assistance programs shall be a product of the United States, except as may otherwise be required by law, and shall be considered to be such a product if it is grown, processed, and otherwise prepared for sale or distribution exclusively in the United States except with respect to ingredients as defined above. Ingredients from non-domestic sources will be allowed to be utilized as a United States product if such ingredients are not otherwise:

      (1) Produced in the United States; and

      (2) Commercially available in the United States at fair and reasonable prices from domestic sources.

      (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a commingled product shall be considered to be a product of the United States if the offeror can establish that the offeror has in inventory at the time the contract for the commodity or product is awarded to the offeror, or obtains during the contract performance period specified in the solicitation, or a combination thereof, a sufficient quantity of the commodity or product that was produced in the United States to fulfill the contract being awarded, and all unfulfilled contracts that the offeror entered into to provide such commingled product to the United States.

      (2) To the extent USDA has determined a commodity is one that is generally commingled but is also one which can be readily stored on an identity preserved basis with respect to its country of origin, USDA may require that the commodity procured shall be of 100 percent United States origin.

      (d)  With respect to the procurement of products derived from animals, the solicitation will set forth any specific requirement that is applicable to the country in which the animal was bred, raised, slaughtered or further processed.

      470.201   Acquisition of commodities and freight shipment for Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) programs.

#### § 470.201

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, in contracts for FAS for commodities and related freight shipment for delivery to foreign destinations, the contracting officer shall consider the lowest landed cost of delivering the commodity to the intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination will be calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and practicable to meet cargo preference requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued with respect to a commodity procurement, or a related freight procurement will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity or related freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or related freight, results in a lower landed cost.

      (2) USDA may contact any port prior to award to determine the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo. Factors considered in this determination may include, but not be limited to: The adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices. USDA may consider the use of another coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely affect the ability of USDA to have the commodity delivered in a safe and timely manner. Such situations include:

      (i) A port is congested;

      (ii) Port facilities are overloaded;

      (iii) A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay;

      (iv) Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or

      (v) Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of USDA to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.

      (3) Use of other than lowest landed cost. In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the contracting officer may award an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:

      (i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or

      (ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:

      (A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;

      (B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors may adversely affect the delivery of such commodities through damage or untimely delivery. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: Port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels not being able to dock and load cargo without delay due to conditions at the port; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;

      (C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the timely delivery of the commodity;

      (D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured; or

      (E) The contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest-landed cost, or that efficiency and cost-savings justify use of types of ocean service that would not involve an analysis of freight. However, in all such cases, commodities would be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements. Other types of services may include, but are not limited to, multi-trip voyage charters, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), delivery cost and freight (C & F), delivery cost insurance and freight (CIF), and indexed ocean freight costs.

      (4) If the contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer will provide to the Head of Contracting Activity or Designee a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis consistent with title 48 of the CFR. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The HCA, or the designee one level above the contracting officer, may either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination.

      (b)  If more than one offer for the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.

      (c)  (1) In determining the lowest-landed cost, USDA shall use the freight rates offered in response to solicitations issued by USDA or, if applicable, the grantee organization.

      (2) Freight rates offered must be submitted as specified in the solicitation issued by USDA or, if applicable, the grantee organization. Any such solicitation issued by a grantee organization must contain the following elements:

      (i) If directed by USDA, include a closing time for the receipt of written freight offers and state that late written freight offers will not be considered;

      (ii) Provide that freight offers are required to have a canceling date no later than the last contract lay day specified in the solicitation;

      (iii) Provide the same deadline for receipt of written freight offers from both U.S. flag vessel and non-U.S. flag vessels; and

      (iv) Be received and opened prior to any related offer for acquisition of commodities to be shipped.

      (3) USDA may require organizations that will receive commodities from USDA to submit information relating to the capacity of a U.S. port, or, if applicable, a terminal, prior to the acquisition of such commodities or freight.

      (d)  If USDA is not the party procuring freight with respect to a shipment of an agricultural commodity for delivery to a foreign destination, the organization that will receive commodities from USDA, or its shipping agent, shall be notified by USDA of the vessel freight rate used in determining the commodity contract award and the organization will be responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the vessel representing the freight rate.

      470.202   Acquisition of commodities for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programs.

#### § 470.202

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (d)(2) of this section, with respect to the acquisition of agricultural commodities for delivery to foreign destinations and related freight to transport such commodities under Title II of Public Law 83-480, contracts will be entered into in a manner that will result in the lowest landed cost of such commodity delivery to the intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination shall be calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and practicable to meet cargo preference requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued with respect to a commodity procurement, or a freight procurement will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity or freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or freight, results in a lower landed cost.

      (2) USDA may contact any port prior to award to determine the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo. Factors which will be considered in this determination will include, but not be limited to, the adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices. USDA may consider the use of another coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely affect the ability of USDA to have the commodity delivered in a safe and/or timely manner. Such situations include:

      (i) A port is congested;

      (ii) Port facilities are overloaded;

      (iii) A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay;

      (iv) Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or

      (v) Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.

      (3) In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, USDA may complete an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if:

      (i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or

      (ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:

      (A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;

      (B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors will adversely affect the delivery of such commodities without damage or in a timely manner. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: Port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;

      (C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the ability of USDA to achieve timely delivery of the commodity; or

      (D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured.

      (4) If the contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer shall provide to the HCA or Designee and to USAID, a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The HCA or Designee one level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of USAID, shall, on an expedited basis, either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination in writing and provide a copy to USAID.

      (b)  (1) In determining lowest-landed cost as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, USDA shall use vessel rates offered in response to solicitations issued by USAID or grantee organizations receiving commodities under 7 U.S.C. 1721

      (2) USAID may require, or direct a grantee organization to require, an ocean carrier to submit offers electronically through a Web-based system maintained by USDA. If electronic submissions are required, USDA may, at its discretion, accept corrections to such submissions that are submitted in a written form other than by use of such Web-based system.

      (c)  The contracting officer shall consider total transit time, as it relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy program requirements for Title II of Public Law 83-480.

      (d)  (1) If more than one offer for the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.

      (2) The contracting officer may determine that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest landed cost. However, in all such cases, commodities may be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements as determined by USAID.

      (3) The contracting officer shall notify USAID or, if applicable, the grantee organization, that its shipping agent will be notified of the vessel freight rate used in determining the commodity contract award. The grantee organization or USAID will be responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the vessel representing the freight rate so used.
