#### § § 301-2.1

      Yes, generally you must have written or electronic authorization before incurring any travel expense.

        § 301-10.4   How does my agency select the method of transportation to be used?

#### § § 301-10.4

        Your agency must select the method most advantageous to the Government, when cost and other factors are considered. Under 5 U.S.C. 5733, travel must be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of your duties. In addition, your agency must consider energy conservation, total cost to the Government (including costs of per diem, overtime, lost worktime, and actual transportation costs), total distance traveled, number of points visited, and number of travelers.

        § 301-10.5   What are the presumptions as to the most advantageous method of transportation by order of precedence?

#### § § 301-10.5

        (a)  Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation and must be used when reasonably available.

        (b)  When your agency determines that your travel must be performed by automobile, a Government-furnished automobile is presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation.

        (c)  If no Government-furnished automobile is available, but your agency has determined that travel must be performed by automobile, then a rental car should be authorized.

        (d)  POVs should be determined to be the most advantageous method of transportation only after your agency evaluates the use of a common carrier, a Government-furnished automobile, and a rental car.

#### § § 301-10.8

        Your reimbursement will be limited to the cost of travel by a direct route or on an uninterrupted basis. You will be responsible for any additional costs.

      Subpart B—Common Carrier Transportation

        Use of Contract City Pair Program Fares

          § 301-10.110   When must I use a contract City Pair Program fare?

#### § § 301-10.110

          If you are an employee of an agency as defined in § 301-1.1 of this chapter, you must use a contract City Pair Program fare for scheduled air passenger transportation service unless one of the limited exceptions in § 301-10.111 exists.

> [FTR Case 2020-300-1, 87 FR 55704, Sept. 12, 2022]

          § 301-10.111   Are there any exceptions to the use of a contract City Pair Program fare?

#### § § 301-10.111

          Yes, your agency may authorize use of a non-contract fare when:

          (a) There are no accommodations available on any scheduled contract City Pair Program flight arriving to your destination in time to accomplish the purpose of your travel or use of contract service would require you to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs which would increase the total cost of the trip;

          (b) The contractor's flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit policies of your Federal department or agency with regard to scheduling travel during normal working hours;

          (c) A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare to the general public that, if used, will result in a lower total trip cost to the Government (the combined costs of transportation, lodging, meals, and related expenses considered); or

          (d) Cost effective rail transportation is available and is consistent with mission requirements.

          (a) Before purchasing a non-contract fare you must meet one of the exception requirements listed in § 301-10.111 and show approval on your travel authorization to use a non-contract fare; and

          (b) If the non-contract fare is non-refundable, restricted, or has specific eligibility requirements, you must know or reasonably anticipate, based on your planned trip, that you will use the ticket; and

          (c) Your agency must determine that the proposed non-contract transportation is practical and cost effective for the Government.

          § 301-10.113   What is my liability for unauthorized use of a non-contract carrier when contract service is available and I do not meet one of the exceptions for required use?

#### § § 301-10.113

          You are responsible for any additional costs or penalties incurred by you resulting from unauthorized use of non-contract service.

          § 301-10.120   What must I do when different airlines furnish the same service at different fares?

#### § § 301-10.120

          When there is no contract City Pair Program fare and other carriers furnish the same service at different fares between the same points for the same type of accommodations, you must use the lowest cost service unless your agency determines that the use of higher cost service is more advantageous to the Government.

          § 301-10.121   When may I use coach class seating upgrade programs?

#### § § 301-10.121

          Use of upgraded coach class seating options is generally a traveler's personal choice and therefore is at the traveler's personal expense. However, your agency approving official may approve reimbursement of the additional seat choice fee according to part 301-13 of this chapter or internal agency policy (see § 301-70.102(k)).

> [FTR Case 2020-300-1, 87 FR 55704, Sept. 12, 2022]

          § 301-10.122   What must I do with compensation an airline gives me if it denies me a seat on a plane?

#### § § 301-10.122

          If you are performing official travel and a carrier denies you a confirmed reserved seat on a plane, you must give your agency any payment you receive for liquidated damages. You must ensure the carrier shows the “Treasurer of the United States” as payee on the compensation check and then forward the payment to the appropriate agency official.

          § 301-10.123   May I keep compensation an airline gives me for voluntarily vacating my seat on my scheduled airline flight when the airline asks for volunteers?

#### § § 301-10.123

          (a) Yes, you may keep airline compensation if:

          (1) Voluntarily vacating your seat will not interfere with performing your official duties; and

          (2) Additional travel expenses, incurred as a result of vacating your seat, are borne by you and are not reimbursed by the Government.

          (b) If volunteering delays your travel during duty hours, your agency will charge you with annual leave for the additional hours.

          § 301-10.124   When may I use a reduced group or charter fare?

#### § § 301-10.124

          You may use a reduced group or charter fare when your agency has determined, on an individual case basis before your travel begins, that use of such a fare is cost effective. Chartered aircraft are subject to the same rules as Government aircraft, and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government are subject to the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-126 and 41 CFR part 102-33 in making such cost effectiveness determinations.

          § 301-10.136   What exceptions to the Fly America Act requirements apply when I travel between the United States and another country?

#### § § 301-10.136

          The exceptions are:

          (a) If a U.S. flag air carrier offers nonstop or direct service (no aircraft change) from your origin to your destination, you must use the U.S. flag air carrier service unless such use would extend your travel time, including delay at origin, by 24 hours or more.

          (b) If a U.S. flag air carrier does not offer nonstop or direct service (no aircraft change) between your origin and your destination, you must use a U.S. flag air carrier on every portion of the route where it provides service unless, when compared to using a foreign air carrier, such use would:

          (1) Increase the number of aircraft changes you must make outside of the U.S. by 2 or more; or

          (2) Extend your travel time by at least 6 hours or more; or

          (1) Cannot provide the air transportation needed; or

          (2) Will not accomplish the agency's mission.

          (b) Necessity includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:

          (1) When the agency determines that use of a foreign air carrier is necessary for medical reasons, including use of foreign air carrier service to reduce the number of connections and possible delays in the transportation of persons in need of medical treatment; or

          (2) When use of a foreign air carrier is required to avoid an unreasonable risk to your safety and is approved by your agency (e.g., terrorist threats). Written approval of the use of foreign air carrier service based on an unreasonable risk to your safety must be approved by your agency on a case by case basis. An agency determination and approval of use of a foreign air carrier based on a threat against a U.S. flag air carrier must be supported by a travel advisory notice issued by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of State. An agency determination and approval of use of a foreign air carrier based on a threat against Government employees or other travelers must be supported by evidence of the threat(s) that form the basis of the determination and approval; or

          (3) When you cannot purchase a ticket in your authorized class of service on a U.S. flag air carrier, and a seat is available in your authorized class of service on a foreign air carrier.

        § 301-10.103   When may I use other than coach class accommodations?

#### § § 301-10.103

        You are required to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business when making official travel arrangements. Therefore, you are required to use the least expensive class of accommodations necessary to meet your needs and accomplish the agency's mission. You may use the lowest other than coach class accommodations only when your agency specifically authorizes or approves such use as specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

        (1) Required to accommodate a medical disability or other special need;

        (i) A medical disability must be certified annually in a written statement by a competent medical authority. However, if the disability is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required. Certification statements must include at a minimum:

        (A) A written statement by a competent medical authority stating that special accommodation is necessary;

        (B) An approximate duration of the special accommodation; and

        (C) A recommendation as to the suitable class of transportation accommodations based on the medical disability.

        (ii) A special need must be certified annually in writing according to your agency's procedures. However, if the special need is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required;

        (iii) If you are authorized under § 301-13.3(a) of this subchapter to have an attendant accompany you, your agency may also authorize the attendant to use premium economy class accommodations if you require the attendant's services en route;

        (2) Exceptional security circumstances, as determined by your agency, require premium economy class accommodations;

        (3) Coach class accommodations on an authorized foreign carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards;

        (4) Regularly scheduled service between origin and destination points, including connecting points, provide only other than coach class accommodations and you certify such on your voucher;

        (5) Your common carrier costs are paid in full through agency acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source in accordance with chapter 304 of this title;

        (6) Your origin and/or destination is/are OCONUS and your scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of eight hours;

        (7) The use results in an overall cost savings to the Government by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach class accommodations;

        (8) No space is available in coach class accommodations that allows you to arrive in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed; or

        (9) Required because of agency mission, consistent with your agency's internal procedures pursuant to § 301-70.102(i).

        (b) Your agency may authorize or approve business class accommodations under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (7) through (9) of this section, or when:

        (1) Your origin and/or destination are OCONUS;

        (2) Your scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is more than 14 hours;

        (3) You are required to report to duty the following day or sooner; and

        (4) Your agency has determined business class accommodations are more advantageous than authorizing a rest period en route or at your destination pursuant to § 301-11.20.

        (c) Your agency may authorize or approve first class accommodations under paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (9) of this section, or when no coach class, premium economy class, or business class accommodations are reasonably available. “Reasonably available” means available on a common carrier that is scheduled to leave within 24 hours of your proposed departure time, or scheduled to arrive within 24 hours of your proposed arrival time.

#### § § 301-10.261

          You may use Government aircraft—

          (a) For official travel only when—

          (1) No scheduled commercial airline service is reasonably available ( able to meet your departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period, unless you demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances require a shorter period) to fulfill your agency's travel requirement; or

          (2) The cost of using a Government aircraft is less than the cost of the city-pair fare for scheduled commercial airline service or the cost of the lowest available full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not available to you. The cost of non-productive or lost work time while in travel status and certain other costs should be considered when comparing the cost of using a Government aircraft in lieu of scheduled commercial airline service. Additional information on costs included in this cost comparison may be found in the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,” available by emailing .

          (b) For required-use travel only when you are required to use Government aircraft for bona fide communications (e.g., 24-hour secure communications) or security reasons (e.g., highly unusual circumstances that present a clear and present danger) or exceptional scheduling requirements (e.g., a national emergency or other compelling operational considerations). Required use travel may include travel for official, personal, or political purposes, but must be approved in accordance with §§ 301-10.262(a) and 301-70.803(a).

          (c) For space available travel only when—

          (1) The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official purpose, and your use of the aircraft does not require a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government; or

          (2) You are a Federal traveler or a dependent of a Federal traveler stationed by the Government in a remote location not accessible to commercial airline service and authorized to use Government aircraft; or

          (3) You are authorized to travel on a space available basis under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute.

          Your agency will authorize your travel on Government aircraft as follows:

          (a)  Your agency's senior legal official or their principal deputy must authorize your required-use travel on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance, in writing, and in compliance with the agency's written policies describing the special circumstances under which the agency will require a traveler to use Government aircraft, unless—

          (1) You are an agency head and the President has determined that all your travel (or your travel in specified categories) qualifies as required-use travel; or

          (2) You are not an agency head, and your agency head has determined in writing that all of your travel, or your travel in specified categories, qualifies as required-use travel. Such written explanation must state the specific basis for the determination.

          (b)  If you are a senior Federal official, your agency's senior legal official or their principal deputy must authorize all your travel on Government aircraft in advance and in writing, except for required use travel authorized under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted. Senior Federal officials who are crewmembers or qualified non-crewmembers on a flight in which they are also traveling ( being transported from point to point) are considered travelers and must be authorized to travel on Government aircraft according to this paragraph.

          (c)  If you are a non-Federal traveler, the senior legal official or their principal deputy in the agency sponsoring your travel must authorize you to fly on Government aircraft in advance and in writing. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your sponsoring agency's senior legal official is permitted.

          (d)  Your designated travel-approving official (or anyone to whom they delegate this authority), who must be at least one organizational level above you, must authorize your travel on Government aircraft, in advance and in writing. Prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's designated travel approving official is permitted in an emergency situation. If you hold a blanket travel authorization for official travel that authorizes travel on Government aircraft, it must define the circumstances that must be met for using Government aircraft and must comply with this regulation and any additional agency policies. Travel on Government aircraft that does not meet the circumstances specified in the blanket travel authorization must be authorized on a trip-by-trip basis in accordance with this regulation and other applicable agency policies. Check with your designated travel approving official for information on your agency's policy.

          (1) For any required use travel, you must reimburse the Government for the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken over the full coach fare for the flights that you would have taken had you not engaged in personal activities during the trip,  for a wholly personal trip, you must pay the full coach fare for the entire trip;

          (2) For travel authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute, or when you or your dependents are stationed by the Government in a remote location with no access to regularly scheduled commercial airline service and are authorized to use Government aircraft, you do not have to reimburse the Government.

          (c) For political travel on a Government aircraft ( for any trip or part of a trip during which you engage in political activities), the Government must be reimbursed the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken on the trip over the full coach fare for the flights that you would have taken had you not engaged in political activities, except if other law or regulation specifies a different amount (see, e.g., 11 CFR 106.3, “Allocation of Expenses between Campaign and Non-campaign Related Travel”), in which case the amount reimbursed is the amount required by such law or regulation.

          § 301-10.450   What are the policies when authorized to rent a vehicle for official travel?

#### § § 301-10.450

          (a) Your agency must determine that use of a rental vehicle is advantageous to the Government and must specifically authorize such use.

          (b) When authorized to use a rental vehicle, you should consider renting a vehicle from a vendor that participates in the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) U.S. Government Car Rental Agreement to avail yourself of the Agreement's benefits, including the insurance and damage liability provisions, unless you are OCONUS and no agreement is in place for your TDY location. The advantages of renting a car through the DTMO rental car program are:

          (1) Rental car agreements are pre-negotiated;

          (2) The agreement includes automatic unlimited mileage and collision damage insurance; and

          (3) The rates established by the car rental agreement cannot be exceeded by the vendor.

          (c) Travelers must use the least expensive compact car available, unless an exception for another class of vehicle is approved. Agencies should approve these exceptions on a limited basis and must indicate on the travel authorization the reason for the exception. Your agency may authorize the use of other than a compact car if any of the following apply:

          (1) When use of other than a compact car is necessary to accommodate a medical disability or other special need.

          (i) A disability must be certified annually in a written statement by a competent medical authority. However, if the disability is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required. Certification statements must include at a minimum:

          (A) A written statement by a competent medical authority stating that special accommodation is necessary;

          (B) An approximate duration of the special accommodation; and

          (ii) A special need must be certified annually in writing according to your agency's procedures. However, if the special need is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required;

          (iii) If you are authorized under § 301-13.3(a) to have an attendant accompany you, your agency may authorize the use of other than a compact car if deemed necessary by your agency.

          (2) When required because of agency mission, consistent with your agency's internal procedures pursuant to § 301-70.102(i).

          (3) When the cost of other than a compact car is less than or equal to the cost of the least expensive compact car.

          (4) When additional room is required to accommodate multiple employees authorized to travel together in the same rental vehicle.

          (5) When travelers must carry a large amount of Government material incident to their official business, and a compact rental vehicle does not contain sufficient space.

          (6) When necessary for safety reasons, such as during severe weather or having to travel on rough or difficult terrain.

          (d) Travelers are not to be reimbursed for purchasing pre-paid refueling options for rental cars. Therefore, travelers should refuel prior to returning the rental vehicle to the drop-off location. However, if it is not possible to refuel completely prior to returning the vehicle because of safety issues or the location of closest fueling station, travelers will be reimbursed for vendor refueling charges.

          (e) Travelers will not be reimbursed for fees associated with rental car loyalty points or the transfer of points charged by car companies.

          (f) A rental car is to be used only for official purposes, which include transportation:

          (1) Between places of official business;

          (2) Between such places and places of temporary lodging when public transportation is unavailable or its use is impractical; or

          (3) Between either subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph and restaurants, drug stores, barber shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and similar places necessary for the sustenance, comfort, or health of the employee to foster the continued efficient performance of Government business.

#### § § 301-11.16

        If you sought to obtain a refund or otherwise took steps to minimize the cost, your agency may reimburse expenses that are not refundable, including a forfeited rental deposit.

        § 301-11.17   If my agency authorizes per diem reimbursement, will it reduce my M&IE allowance for a meal(s) provided by a common carrier or for a complimentary meal(s) provided by a hotel/motel?

#### § § 301-11.17

        No. A meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal provided by a hotel/motel does not affect your per diem.

        § 301-11.18   What M&IE rate will I receive if a meal(s) is furnished by the Government or is included in the registration fee?

#### § § 301-11.18

        (a) Except as provided in § 301-11.17 or in paragraph (b) of this section, your M&IE allowance must be adjusted for meals furnished to you by the Government (including meals furnished under the authority of chapter 304 of this title) by deducting the appropriate amount shown at . For meals provided on the day of departure and the last day of travel, you must deduct the entire allocated meal cost from the decreased M&IE rate (see § 301-11.101). The total amount of deductions made will not cause you to receive less than the amount allowed for incidental expenses.

        (b) Your agency, at its discretion, may allow you to claim the full M&IE allowance if:

        (1) You are unable to consume the furnished meal(s) because of medical requirements or religious beliefs;

        (2) In accordance with administrative procedures prescribed by your agency, you requested specific approval to claim the full M&IE allowance prior to your travel;

        (3) In accordance with administrative procedures prescribed by your agency, you have made a reasonable effort to make alternative meal arrangements, but were unable to do so; and

        (4) You purchase substitute meals in order to satisfy your medical requirements or religious beliefs.

        (c) In your agency's discretion, and in accordance with administrative procedures prescribed by your agency, you may also claim the full M&IE allowance if you were unable to take part in a Government-furnished meal due to the conduct of official business.

#### § § 301-11.20

        (a) Your agency may authorize a rest period not in excess of 24 hours at either an intermediate point or at your destination when:

        (c) Your agency may authorize a rest period that exceeds 24 hours when no scheduled transportation service departs within 24 hours of your arrival at an intermediate point. To qualify for a rest period exceeding 24 hours, you must be scheduled to board the first available scheduled departure. Your agency will determine a reasonable additional length of time for any rest period exceeding 24 hours.

#### § § 301-11.21

        (a) In general, you will be reimbursed as long as your travel status requires your stay to include a non-workday, (e.g., if you are on travel through Friday and again starting Monday you will be reimbursed for Saturday and Sunday), however, your agency should determine the most cost effective situation ( remaining in a travel status and paying per diem or actual expenses or permitting your return to your official station).

        (b) Your agency will determine whether you will be reimbursed for non-workdays when you take leave immediately (e.g., Friday or Monday) before or after the non-workday(s).

        § 301-11.23   Are there any other circumstances when my agency may reimburse me to return home or to my official station for non-workdays during a TDY assignment?

#### § § 301-11.23

        Your agency may authorize per diem or actual expense and round-trip transportation expenses for periodic return travel on non-workdays to your home or official station under the following circumstances:

        (a) The agency requires you to return to your official station to perform official business; or

        (b) The agency will realize a substantial cost savings by returning you home; or

        (c) Periodic return travel home is justified incident to an extended TDY assignment.

#### § § 301-11.24

        If you voluntarily return home or to your official station on non-workdays during a TDY assignment, the maximum reimbursement for round trip transportation and per diem or actual expense is limited to what would have been allowed had you remained at the TDY location.

        § 301-11.25   Must I provide receipts to substantiate my claimed travel expenses?

#### § § 301-11.25

        Yes. You must provide a lodging receipt and a receipt for every authorized expense over $75, or provide a reason acceptable to your agency explaining why you are unable to furnish the necessary receipt(s) (see § 301-52.4 of this chapter).

#### § § 301-11.27

        No. Lodging taxes paid by you are reimbursable as a miscellaneous travel expense limited to the taxes on reimbursable lodging costs. For example, if your agency authorizes you a maximum lodging rate of $50 per night, and you elect to stay at a hotel that costs $100 per night, you can only claim the amount of taxes on $50, which is the maximum authorized lodging amount. This section is effective January 1, 1999, for CONUS locations and effective January 1, 2000, for non-foreign areas. For foreign areas, lodging taxes have not been removed from foreign per diem rates established by the Department of State. Separate claims for lodging taxes incurred in foreign areas are not allowed.

#### § § 301-11.31

        Your agency may reimburse the expenses incurred for laundry, cleaning, and pressing of clothing as a miscellaneous travel expense for TDY within CONUS. However, you must incur a minimum of four consecutive nights lodging on official travel to qualify for this reimbursement. Laundry and dry cleaning expenses have not been removed from foreign per diem rates established by the Department of State, or from non-foreign area per diem rates established by the Department of Defense. Separate claims for laundry and dry cleaning expenses incurred in foreign areas and non-foreign areas are not allowed.

        Yes, your agency may reimburse you for an advance room deposit, when such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation, prior to the beginning of your scheduled official travel. However, if you are reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fail to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to your agency, resulting in forfeit of the deposit, you are indebted to the Government for that amount and must repay it in a manner prescribed by your agency.

        General

          § 301-11.601   What is a taxable extended TDY assignment?

#### § § 301-11.601

          A taxable extended TDY assignment is a TDY assignment that continues for so long that, under the IRC the employee is no longer considered temporarily away from home during any period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year. You are no longer temporarily away from home as of the date that you and/or your agency recognize that your assignment will exceed one year. That is, as soon as you recognize that your assignment will exceed one year, you must notify your agency of that fact, and they must change your status immediately. Similarly, as soon as your agency recognizes that your assignment will exceed one year, your agency must notify you of that fact and change your status. The effective date of this status change is the date on which it was recognized that you are no longer temporarily away from home as defined in the IRC.

          (a) If you believe that your temporary duty assignment may exceed one year, you should carefully study IRS Publication 463, “Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses,” to determine whether you are or will be considered “temporarily away from home” under this provision. If you are not or will not be considered temporarily away from home under this provision, then you are on taxable extended TDY.

          (b) The IRC makes an exception for certain Federal personnel involved in investigation or prosecution of a Federal crime during any period for which such employee is certified by the Attorney General (or the designee thereof) as traveling on behalf of the United States in temporary duty status to investigate or prosecute, or provide support services for the investigation or prosecution of, a Federal crime.

#### § § 301-11.602

          Your agency should consider the factors discussed in § 302-3.502 of this subtitle in determining whether to authorize extended TDY.

          § 301-11.603   What are the tax consequences of extended TDY?

#### § § 301-11.603

          (a) If you are on a taxable extended TDY assignment, then all allowances and reimbursements for travel expenses, plus all travel expenses that the Government pays directly on your behalf in connection with your TDY assignment, are taxable income to you. This includes all allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors from the day that you or your agency recognized that your extended TDY assignment is expected to exceed one year, as explained in § 301-11.601.

          (b) Your agency will reimburse you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your taxable extended TDY assignment. This reimbursement consists of two parts:

          (1) The Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA). See Part 302-17, Subpart B of this Subtitle for information on the WTA; and

          (2) The “Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance” (ETTRA) (in previous editions of the FTR this was known as the “Income Tax Reimbursement Allowance”).

          (c) The WTA and ETTRA for taxable extended TDY assignments cover only the TDY benefits described in FTR Chapter 301, Subchapter B. On an extended TDY assignment, you are not eligible for the other benefits that you would have received if your agency had permanently relocated you.

          § 301-11.604   What are the procedures for calculation and reimbursement of my WTA and ETTRA for taxable extended TDY?+

#### § § 301-11.604

          (a) If your agency knows from the beginning of your TDY assignment that your assignment qualifies as taxable extended TDY, then your agency will withhold an amount as a WTA and pay that as withholding tax to the IRS until your extended TDY assignment ends. The WTA itself is taxable income to you, so your agency increases, or “grosses-up,” the amount of the WTA, using a formula to reimburse you for the additional taxes on the WTA.

          (b) If your agency realizes during a TDY assignment that you will incur taxes (because, for example, the TDY assignment has lasted, or is going to last, longer than originally intended), then your agency will compute the WTA for all taxable benefits received since the date it was recognized that you are no longer “temporarily away from home” (see § 302-11.601 for more information on the meaning of “temporarily away from home”). Your agency will pay that amount to the IRS, and then will begin paying WTA to the IRS until your extended TDY assignment ends.

          (c) For your ETTRA, your agency will use the same one-year or two-year process that it has chosen to use for the relocation income tax allowance (RITA).

          (d) See part 302-17 of this subtitle for additional information on the WTA and RITA processes.

#### § § 301-11.605

          You should file your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” for your taxable extended TDY assignment at the beginning of your extended TDY assignment, or as soon as you or your agency realizes that your TDY assignment will incur taxes. You should provide the same information as the sample “Statements of Income and Tax Filing Status” shown in part 302-17, subpart F (one-year process) or subpart G (two-year process) of this subtitle.

      Subpart B—Policies and Procedures Relating to Transportation

        § 301-70.100   How must we administer the authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

#### § § 301-70.100

        You must:

        (a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government;

        (b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.

        § 301-70.101   What factors must we consider in determining which method of transportation results in the greatest advantage to the Government?

#### § § 301-70.101

        In selecting a particular method of transportation you must consider:

        (a) The total cost to the Government, including per diem, overtime, lost worktime, actual transportation cost, total distance of travel, number of points visited, the number of travelers and energy conservation. As stated in 5 U.S.C. 5733, “travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.”

        (b) Travel by common carrier (air, rail, bus) is considered the most advantageous method to perform official travel. Other methods of transportation may be authorized as advantageous only when the use of common carrier transportation would interfere with the performance of official business or impose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when the total cost by common carrier exceeds the cost by another method of transportation. A determination that another method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government than common carrier will not be made on the basis of personal preference or inconvenience to the traveler.

        (c) When travel must be performed by automobile, agencies should next consider using a Government-furnished automobile.

        (d) If a Government-furnished automobile is not available, agencies should then consider using the least expensive compact rental vehicle.

        (e) Agencies should lastly consider authorizing a POV only if the employee agrees to use a POV, because agencies cannot mandate employees to use their POV for official reasons.

        § 301-70.102   What governing policies must we establish for authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

#### § § 301-70.102

        You must establish policies and procedures governing:

        (a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government;

        (b) Who will approve any of the following:

        (1) Use of other than coach class accommodations under § 301-10.103 of this chapter;

        (2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;

        (3) Use of an extra-fare train service under § 301-10.160;

        (4) Use of ship service;

        (5) Use of a foreign ship;

        (6) Use of a foreign air carrier;

        (c) When you will:

        (1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;

        (2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and

        (3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;

        (d) When you consider the use of a POV advantageous to the Government, such as travel to and from common carrier terminals or to the TDY location. When determining whether the use of a POV to a TDY location is the most advantageous method of transportation, you must consider the total cost of using a POV as compared to the total cost of using a rental vehicle, including rental costs, fuel, taxes, parking (at a common carrier terminal—not to exceed the cost of taxi or transportation network company fare, etc.), and any other relevant costs;

        (e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;

        (f) Procedures for allowing the use of a special conveyance (e.g., taxis, TNCs, innovative mobility technology companies, or commercially rented vehicles), taking into account the requirements of § 301-10.450;

        (g) What procedures an employee must follow when the employee travels by an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route;

        (h) Whether to reimburse the full amount of transportation costs and in conjunction with TDY or only the amount by which transportation costs exceed the employee's normal costs for transportation between:

        (1) Office or duty point and another place of business;

        (2) Places of business; or

        (3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point;

        (i) Develop and issue internal guidance on what specific mission criteria justify use of other than coach class under § 301-10.103(a)(9) and the use of other than the least expensive compact car available under § 301-10.450(c). The justification criteria shall be noted on the traveler's authorization.

        (j) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding what constitutes a rest period upon arrival at a temporary duty location; and

        (k) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding when coach class seating upgrade fees will be authorized as advantageous to the Government and reimbursed (see § 301-10.121).

        § 301-70.103   In what circumstance may we authorize use of ship service?

#### § § 301-70.103

        Travel by ship is not generally regarded as advantageous. You must determine that the advantages accruing from the use of ocean transportation offset the higher costs associated with ship travel,  per diem, transportation, and lost worktime.

        § 301-70.104   What factors should we consider in determining whether to require an employee to commit to the use of a Government-furnished automobile?

#### § § 301-70.104

        You should consider:

        (a) The advantages of using a Government-furnished automobile . Such advantages may include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Full utilization or availability of fleet vehicles;

        (2) Lower cost;

        (3) Official presence.

        (b) The type of travel the employee performs. You should require such a commitment when an employee or group of employees requires the use of an automobile for official travel on a frequent or repetitive basis.

        § 301-70.105   May we prohibit an employee from using a POV on official travel?

#### § § 301-70.105

        No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:

        (a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized method of transportation, which is the sum of travel and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred had the employee traveled by the method of transportation deemed to be most advantageous to the Government. The calculation will necessarily involve assumptions. Examples of related expenses that could be considered constructive costs include, but are not limited to, taxi and TNC fares, baggage fees, rental car costs, tolls, ferry fees, and parking charges; and

        (b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of travel by POV.

        § 301-70.201   May we issue a blanket actual expense authorization for our employees during a Presidentially-Declared Disaster?

#### § § 301-70.201

        Yes. A blanket authorization regarding actual expense reimbursement may be issued to your employees assigned to perform TDY travel in an area subject to a Presidentially-Declared Disaster. These authorizations must apply to a specific Declaration, and must end on the expiration date of the Declaration, or one year from the date the Declaration is issued, whichever is sooner. A blanket authorization issued under this section shall not apply to any travel performed pursuant to chapter 302 of this title.

        You should limit payment of miscellaneous expenses to only those expenses that are necessary and in the interest of the Government.

        § 301-70.301   What governing policies must we establish for payment of miscellaneous expenses?

#### § § 301-70.301

        You must establish policies and procedures governing:

        (b) Who will determine if the employee's situation warrants payment for emergency travel expenses;

        (c) When and by whom travel to an alternate location other than official station or point of interruption will be authorized; and

        (d) Who will determine when and if the definition of family may be extended and to whom.

        § 301-70.501   Does per diem continue when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury?

#### § § 301-70.501

        Yes, when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave (annual or sick), per diem will be allowed, not to exceed the maximum rate for the location where the interruption occurs, for a reasonable period, normally not to exceed 14 calendar days (including fractional days) for any one period of absence. You may approve a longer period if justified.

        § 301-70.503   What additional emergency expenses should we allow?

#### § § 301-70.503

        When an employee discontinues a TDY assignment before its completion due to an incapacitating illness or injury, you may pay—

#### § § 301-70.504

        Not if the interrupted trip was authorized under a trip by trip authorization. If, when the employee's health has been restored, the agency decides that it is in the Government's interest to return the employee to the TDY location, such return is considered to be a new travel assignment at Government expense. An interrupted trip authorized under an open or limited open authorization may be continued without further authorization.

        Yes. When an employee interrupts a TDY assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave of absence for travel to an alternate location to obtain medical services and returns to the TDY assignment, you may reimburse certain excess travel costs provided in this section. Specifically, you may reimburse the excess (if any) of actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to the alternate location and return to the TDY assignment, over the constructive costs of round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate location. The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating the employee's illness or injury will not, however, be considered an alternate location.

        (a) Actual cost of travel will be the transportation expenses incurred and en route per diem for the travel as actually performed from the point of interruption to the alternate location and from the alternate location to the TDY assignment. No per diem is allowed for time spent at the alternate location if confined to a medical facility.

        (b) Constructive cost is the sum of travel and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred for round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate location plus per diem calculated for the appropriate en route travel time. The calculation will necessarily involve assumptions. Examples of related expenses that could be considered constructive costs include, but are not limited to, taxi and TNC fares, baggage fees, rental car costs, tolls, ferry fees, and parking charges.

#### § § 301-70.601

        You should consider:

        (a)  You should pay transportation and subsistence expenses only if a situation poses a legitimate serious threat to life.

        (b)  You should consider whether relocating the employee permanently would be advantageous given the specific nature of the threat, the continued disruption of the family, and the alternative costs of a change of official station.

      Subpart I—Policies and Procedures for Agencies That Authorize Travel on Government Aircraft

**Source:** Source: FTR Amdt. 2004-02, 69 FR 34305, June 21, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

        § 301-70.800   Whom may we authorize to travel on Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.800

        You may authorize Federal travelers, non-Federal travelers, and any other passengers, as defined in part 300-3 of this subtitle, to travel on Government aircraft, subject to the rules in this subpart. Because the taxpayers generally should pay no more than necessary for transportation of travelers, except for required use travel, you may authorize travel on Government aircraft only when a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective mode of travel and the traveler is traveling for Governmental purposes.

        § 301-70.801   When may we authorize travel on Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.801

        You may authorize travel on Government aircraft only as follows:

        (a) For official travel when—

        (1) No scheduled commercial airline service is reasonably available to fulfill your agency's travel requirement ( able to meet the traveler's departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period, unless you demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances require a shorter period); or

        (2) The cost of using a Government aircraft is not more than the cost of the city-pair fare for scheduled commercial airline service or the cost of the lowest available full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not available to the traveler.

        (b) For required-use travel,  when the traveler is authorized to use Government aircraft because of bona fide communications needs (e.g., 24-hour secure communications are required) or security reasons (e.g., highly unusual circumstances that present a clear and present danger to the traveler) or exceptional scheduling requirements (e.g., a national emergency or other compelling operational considerations). Required-use travel may include travel for official, personal, or political purposes, but must be approved in accordance with §§ 301-10.262(a) and 301-70.803(a).

        (c) For space available travel when—

        (1) The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official purpose and carrying an official traveler(s) on the aircraft does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government; or

        (2) The Federal traveler or the dependent of a Federal traveler is stationed by the Government in a remote location not accessible to commercial airline service; or

        (3) The traveler is authorized to travel space available under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute.

> [FTR Amdt. 2004-02, 69 FR 34305, June 21, 2004, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2010-04, 75 FR 59095, Sept. 27, 2010]

        § 301-70.802   Must we ensure that travel on Government aircraft is the most cost-effective alternative?

#### § § 301-70.802

        (a) Yes, you must ensure that travel on a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective alternative that will meet the travel requirement. Your designated travel approving official must—

        (1) Compare the cost of all travel alternatives, as applicable, that is—

        (i) Travel on a scheduled commercial airline;

        (ii) Travel on a Federal aircraft;

        (iii) Travel on a Government aircraft hired as a commercial aviation service (CAS); and

        (iv) Travel by other available modes of transportation; and

        (2) Approve only the most cost-effective alternative that meets your agency's needs.

        (3) Consider the cost of non-productive or lost work time while in travel status and certain other costs when comparing the costs of using Government aircraft in lieu of scheduled commercial airline service and other available modes of transportation. Additional information on costs included in the cost comparison may be found in the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,” published by the General Services Administration, Office of Government-wide Policy. To obtain a copy of the guide, please contact

        (b) The aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the Government aircraft must provide your designated travel-approving official with cost estimates for a Government aircraft trip ( a Federal aircraft trip cost or a CAS aircraft trip cost).

        (c) When an agency operates a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings.

        § 301-70.803   How must we authorize travel on a Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.803

        You must authorize travel on a Government aircraft as follows:

        (a)  Your agency must first establish written standards for determining the special circumstances under which it will require travelers to use Government aircraft. Then, following those standards, your agency's senior legal official or their principal deputy must authorize required-use travel on a trip-by-trip basis in advance and in writing, unless—

        (1) The traveler is an agency head, and the President has determined that all of their travel, or travel in specified categories, requires the use of Government aircraft; or

        (2) Your agency head has determined in writing that all travel, or travel in specified categories, by another traveler requires the use of Government aircraft.

        (b)  Your agency's senior legal official or their principal deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by senior Federal officials on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing, except for required use travel authorized under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted. Senior Federal officials who are crewmembers or qualified non-crewmembers on a flight in which they are also traveling ( being transported from point-to-point) are considered travelers and must be authorized to travel on Government aircraft according to this paragraph.

        (c)  If you are the sponsoring agency for a non-Federal traveler, your senior legal official or their deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by that non-Federal traveler on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted.

        (d)  (1) Your agency's designated travel approving official (or anyone to whom they delegate this authority and who is at least one organizational level above the traveler) must authorize, in advance and in writing, all other travel on Government aircraft ( by passengers, crewmembers, or qualified non-crewmembers) that is not covered in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

        (2) When authorizing space available travel (except as authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute), you must ensure that the aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the aircraft has certified in writing before the flight that the aircraft is scheduled to be used for a bona fide governmental function. Bona fide governmental functions may include support for official travel. The aircraft management office must also certify that carrying a traveler(s) in space available does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government. The aircraft management office must retain this certification for two years. In an emergency situation, prior verbal confirmation of this information with an after-the-fact written certification is permitted.

        § 301-70.804   What amount must the Government be reimbursed for travel on a Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.804

        (a) No reimbursement is required for official travel on a Government aircraft.

        (b) For personal travel on Government aircraft, reimbursement depends upon which of the following special cases applies:

        (1) You must require a traveler on required-use travel to reimburse the Government for the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken on a trip over the full coach fare for the flights that the traveler would have taken had they not engaged in personal activities during the trip; and

        (2) No reimbursement is required for travel authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute, or when the traveler and the traveler's dependents are stationed by the Government in a remote location with no access to regularly scheduled commercial airline service.

        (c) For political travel on a Government aircraft ( for any trip or part of a trip during which the traveler engages in political activities), you must require that the Government be reimbursed the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken on the trip over the full coach fare for the flights that the traveler would have taken had they not engaged in political activities, except if other law or regulation specifies a different amount (see, e.g., 11 CFR 106.3, “Allocation of Expenses between Campaign and Non-campaign Related Travel”), in which case the amount reimbursed is the amount required by such law or regulation.

        § 301-70.805   Must we include special information on a travel authorization for a senior Federal official or a non-Federal traveler who travels on Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.805

        Yes, you must include the following information on a travel authorization for a senior Federal official or a non-Federal traveler:

        (a) Traveler's name with indication that the traveler is either a senior Federal official or a non-Federal traveler, whichever is appropriate.

        (b) The traveler's organization and title or other appropriate descriptive information, e.g., dependent, press, etc.

        (c) Name of the authorizing agency.

        (d) The official purpose of the trip.

        (e) The destination(s).

        (f) For personal or political travel, the amount that the traveler must reimburse the Government ( the full coach fare or appropriate share of that fare).

        (g) For official travel, the comparable city-pair fare (if available to the traveler) or full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not available.

        § 301-70.806   What documentation must we retain for travel on Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.806

        You must retain all travel authorizations and cost-comparisons for travel on Government aircraft for two years.

        § 301-70.807   Must we make information available to the public about travel by senior Federal officials and non-Federal travelers on Government aircraft?

#### § § 301-70.807

        Yes, an agency that authorizes travel on Government aircraft must make records about travelers on those aircraft available to the public in response to written requests under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), except for portions exempt from disclosure under that Act (such as classified information).

        § 301-70.808   Do the rules in this part apply to travel on Government aircraft by the President and Vice President or by individuals traveling in support of the President and Vice President?

#### § § 301-70.808

        Given the unique functions and needs of the presidency and the vice presidency, section 4 of Circular A-126, “Improving the Management and Use of Government Aircraft,” Revised May 1992, makes clear that Circular A-126 does not apply to aircraft while in use by or in support of the President or Vice President. Since the principal purpose of the rules in this part is to implement Circular A-126, the rules in this part also do not apply to such travel. If any questions arise regarding travel related to the President or Vice President, contact the Office of the Counsel to the President or the Office of the Counsel to the Vice President, respectively.

#### § § 301-70.903

        To help ensure that Government aircraft are the most cost-effective alternative for travel, your aircraft management office must calculate the cost of a trip on your aircraft, whether Federal aircraft or CAS aircraft, and submit that information to the traveler's designated travel-approving official upon request. The designated travel-approving official must use that information to compare the cost of using Government aircraft with the cost of scheduled commercial airline service and the cost of using other available modes of transportation. When you operate a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings.

        § 301-71.210   How do we calculate late payment fees?

#### § § 301-71.210

        Late payment fees are calculated either by:

        (a) Using the prevailing Prompt Payment Act Interest Rate beginning on the 31st day after submission of a proper travel claim and ending on the date on which payment is made; or

        (b) A flat fee, of not less than the prompt payment amount, based on an agencywide average of travel claim payments; and

        (c) In addition to the fee required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must also pay an amount equivalent to any late payment charge that the card contractor would have been able to charge had the employee not paid the bill. Payment of this additional fee will be based upon the effective date that a late payment charge would be allowed under the agreement between the employee and the card contractor.

> [FTR Amdt. 92, 65 FR 21366, Apr. 21, 2000]

#### § § 301-71.301

        Yes, you may reimburse an employee an advance room deposit, when such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation, prior to the beginning of an employee's scheduled official travel. However, if the employee is reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fails to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to the agency, resulting in the forfeit of the deposit, the employee is indebted to the Government and must repay that amount in a timely manner as prescribed by you.

        § 301-72.1   Why is common carrier presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation?

#### § § 301-72.1

        Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation because it generally results in the most efficient, least costly, most expeditious means of transportation and the most efficient use of energy resources.

        § 301-72.2   May we utilize methods of transportation other than common carrier (e.g., POVs, chartered vehicles, etc.)?

#### § § 301-72.2

        Yes, but only when use of common carrier transportation:

        (a) Would interfere with the performance of official business;

        (b) Would impose an undue hardship upon the traveler; or

        (c) When the total cost by common carrier would exceed the cost of the other method of transportation.

        § 301-72.3   What method of payment must we authorize for common carrier transportation?

#### § § 301-72.3

        You must authorize one or more of the following as appropriate:

        (c) Cash payments (personal funds or travel advances in the form of travelers checks or authorized ATM cash withdrawals) when the cost of transportation is less than $100, under § 301-51.100 of this chapter (cash may or may not be accepted by the carrier for the purchase of city pair fares); or

        (d) GTR(s) when no other option is available or feasible.

        Your system must:

        (a) Authorize the use of cash in accordance with § 301-51.100 or as otherwise required;

        (b) Correlate travel data accumulated by your authorization and claims accounting systems with common carrier transportation documents and data for audit purposes;

        (c) Identify unused tickets for refund;

        (d) Collect unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets, from travelers upon completion of travel;

        (e) Track denied boarding compensation from employees;

        (f) Identify and collect refunds due from carriers for overpayments, or unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets; and

        (g) Reconcile all centrally billed travel expenses (e.g., airline, lodging, car rentals, etc.) with travel authorizations and claims to assure that only authorized charges are paid.

        § 301-72.101   What information should we provide an employee before authorizing the use of common carrier transportation?

#### § § 301-72.101

        You should provide the employee:

        (a) Notice that the employee is accountable for all tickets, GTRs and other transportation documents;

        (b) Your procedures for the control and accounting of common carrier transportation documents, including the procedures for submitting unused, partially used, downgraded/exchanged tickets, refund receipts or ticket refund applications, and denied boarding compensation; and

        (c) A credit/refund address so the carrier can credit/refund the agency for unused tickets (when the tickets have been issued using an agency centrally billed account or by GTR).

#### § § 301-72.201

        To justify the use of cash in excess of $100, both the agency and traveler must certify on the travel claim the necessity for such use. See 41 CFR 101-41.203-2.

        § 301-72.202   Who may approve cash payments in excess of the $100 limit?

#### § § 301-72.202

        You must ensure the delegation of authority for the authorization or approval of cash payments over the $100 limit is in accordance with 41 CFR 101-41.203-2.

        § 301-72.203   When may we limit traveler reimbursement for a cash payment?

#### § § 301-72.203

        If you determine that the cash payment was made under a non-emergency circumstance, reimbursement to the traveler must not exceed the cost which would have been properly chargeable to the Government had the traveler used a government provided payment resource, (e.g., individual Government contractor-issued travel charge card, centrally billed account, or GTR). However, an agency can determine to make full payment when circumstances warrant (e.g., invitational travel, infrequent travelers and interviewees).

        (a) Written instructions explaining traveler liability for the value of tickets issued until all ticket coupons are used or properly accounted for on the travel voucher;

        (b) Instructions for submitting payments received from carriers for failure to provide confirmed reserved space;

        (1) Such use would result in an unreasonable burden on mission accomplishment ( emergency travel is involved and TMS or ETS is not accessible; the traveler is performing invitational travel; or the traveler has special needs or requires disability accommodations in accordance with part 301-13 of this chapter).

        (2) Such use would compromise a national security interest.

        (1) The agency has presented a business case analysis to the General Services Administration that proves that it has an alternative TMS to the ETS that is in the best interest of the Government and the taxpayer ( the agency has evaluated the economic and service values offered by the ETS contractor(s) compared to those offered by the agency's current or proposed TMS and has determined that the agency's current or proposed TMS is a better value);

        (2) The agency has security, secrecy, or protection of information issues that cannot be mitigated through security provided by the ETS contractor(s);

        (3) The agency lacks the technology necessary to access ETS; or

        (4) The agency has critical and unique technology or business requirements that cannot be accommodated by the ETS contractor(s) at all or at an acceptable and reasonable price ( majority of travel is group-travel).

        (b) As a condition of receiving an exception, the agency must agree to conduct annual business case reviews of its TMS and must provide to the ETS Program Management Office (PMO) data elements required by the ETS PMO in a format prescribed by the ETS PMO.

      Subpart A—Agency Responsibilities

        § 301-74.1   What policies must we follow in planning a conference?

#### § § 301-74.1

        When planning a conference, you must:

        (a) Minimize all conference costs, including administrative costs, conference attendees' travel costs, and conference attendees' time costs;

        (b) Maximize the use of Government-owned or Government provided conference facilities as much as possible;

        (c) Identify opportunities to reduce costs in selecting a particular conference location and facility (e.g., through the availability of lower rates during the off-season at a site with seasonal rates); and

        (d) Ensure that the conference planner or designee does not retain for personal use any promotional benefits or materials received from a travel service provider as a result of booking the conference ( §§ 301-53.2 and 301-53.3 of this chapter); and

        (e) Develop and establish internal policies to ensure these standards are met.

> [FTR Amdt. 89, 65 FR 1327, Jan. 10, 2000, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2003-04, 68 FR 27937, May 22, 2003]

        § 301-74.2   What costs should be considered when planning a conference?

#### § § 301-74.2

        When planning a conference, you should consider all direct and indirect conference costs paid by the Government, whether paid directly by agencies or reimbursed by agencies to travelers or others associated with the conference. Some examples of such costs are:

        (a) Authorized travel and per diem expenses;

        (b) Hire of rooms for official business;

        (c) Audiovisual and other equipment usage;

        (d) Computer and telephone access fees;

        (e) Light refreshments;

        (f) Printing;

        (g) Registration fees;

        (h) Ground transportation; and

        (i) Employees' time at the conference and on en route travel.

        § 301-74.3   What must we do to determine which conference expenditures result in the greatest advantage to the Government?

#### § § 301-74.3

        To determine conference expenditures, you must:

        (a) Assure there is appropriate management oversight of the conference planning process;

        (b) Always do cost comparisons of the size, scope, and location of the proposed conference;

        (c) Determine if a Government facility is available at a cheaper rate than a commercial facility;

        (d) Consider alternatives to a conference, e.g., teleconferencing; and

        (e) Maintain written documentation of the alternatives considered and the selection rationale used.

        § 301-74.4   What should cost comparisons include?

#### § § 301-74.4

        Cost comparisons should include, but not be limited to, a determination of adequacy of lodging rooms at the established per diem rates, overall convenience of the conference location, fees, availability of meeting space, equipment, and supplies, and commuting or travel distance of attendees.

        § 301-74.5   How should we select a location and a facility?

#### § § 301-74.5

        Site selection is a final decision as to where to hold your conference. The term “site” refers to both the geographical location and the specific facility(ies) selected. In determining the best site in the interest of the Government, you should exercise strict fiscal responsibility to minimize costs. The actions in § 301-74.3 must be followed. Cost comparisons must cover factors such as those listed in § 301-74.4. As part of the cost comparison, you must use the established per diem rate for the locations for which you are comparing costs.

        § 301-74.6   What can we do if we cannot find an appropriate conference facility at the chosen locality per diem rate?

#### § § 301-74.6

        While it is always desirable to obtain lodging facilities within the established lodging portion of the per diem rate for the chosen locality, it may not always be possible. In those instances when lodging is not available at the applicable per diem rate, travelers should construct a cost comparison of all associated costs, including round-trip ground transportation, between finding lodging at the applicable per diem rate away from the conference locality and using the actual expense method at the conference locality as prescribed in subpart D of part 301-11 of this chapter.

        § 301-74.24   What is the traveler required to do if they are unable to attend an event for which they were reimbursed for an advanced discounted payment of a conference or training registration fee?

#### § § 301-74.24

        In all cases where a traveler is unable to attend an event for which a discounted registration fee was paid and reimbursed in advance of the event, the traveler must seek a refund of the registration fee and repay the agency with any refund received. If no refund is made, the agency must absorb the advanced payment if the traveler's failure to attend the event was caused either by an agency decision or for reasons beyond the employee's control that are acceptable to the agency, e.g., unforeseen illness or emergency. If no refund is made, and the traveler's failure to attend the scheduled event is due to reasons deemed unexcusable by the agency, the traveler must repay the agency for the amount advanced.
