      (c)  (1) A governing body may establish advisory committees as it deems necessary for effective governance and improvement of the program.

      (2) If a governing body establishes an advisory committee to oversee key responsibilities related to program governance, it must:

      (i) Establish the structure, communication, and oversight in such a way that the governing body continues to maintain its legal and fiscal responsibility for the Head Start agency; and,

      (ii) Notify the responsible HHS official of its intent to establish such an advisory committee.

      § 1301.3   Policy council and policy committee.

#### § § 1301.3

      (a)  Each agency must establish and maintain a policy council responsible for the direction of the Head Start program at the agency level, and a policy committee at the delegate level. If an agency delegates operational responsibility for the entire Head Start program to one delegate agency, the policy council and policy committee may be the same body.

      (b)  (1) A program must establish a policy council in accordance with section 642(c)(2)(B) of the Act, or a policy committee at the delegate level in accordance with section 642(c)(3) of the Act, as early in the program year as possible. Parents of children currently enrolled in each program option must be proportionately represented on the policy council and on the policy committee at the delegate level.

      (2) The program must ensure members of the policy council, and of the policy committee at the delegate level, do not have a conflict of interest pursuant to sections 642(c)(2)(C) and 642(c)(3)(B) of the Act. Staff may not serve on the policy council or policy committee at the delegate level except parents who occasionally substitute as staff. In the case of tribal grant recipients, this exclusion applies only to tribal staff who work in areas directly related to or which directly impact administrative, fiscal, or programmatic issues.

      (c)  (1) A policy council is responsible for activities specified at section 642(c)(2)(D) of the Act. A policy committee must approve and submit to the delegate agency its decisions in each of the following areas referenced at section 642(c)(2)(D)(i) through (vii) of the Act.

      (2) A policy council, and a policy committee at the delegate level, must use ongoing monitoring results, data on school readiness goals, other information described in § 1302.102, and information described in section 642(d)(2) of the Act to conduct its responsibilities.

      (d)  (1) A member will serve for one year.

      (2) If the member intends to serve for another year, s/he must stand for re-election.

      (3) The policy council, and policy committee at the delegate level, must include in its bylaws how many one-year terms, not to exceed five terms, a person may serve.

      (4) A program must seat a successor policy council, or policy committee at the delegate level, before an existing policy council, or policy committee at the delegate level, may be dissolved.

      (e)  A program must enable low-income members to participate fully in their policy council or policy committee responsibilities by providing, if necessary, reimbursements for reasonable expenses incurred by the low-income members.

      § 1301.4   Parent committees.

#### § § 1301.4

      (a)  A program must establish a parent committee comprised exclusively of parents of currently enrolled children as early in the program year as possible. This committee must be established at the center level for center-based programs and at the local program level for other program options. When a program operates more than one option, parents may choose to have a separate committee for each option or combine membership. A program must ensure that parents of currently enrolled children understand the process for elections to the policy council or policy committee and other leadership opportunities.

      (b)  Within the parent committee structure, a program may determine the best methods to engage families using strategies that are most effective in their community, as long as the program ensures the parent committee carries out the following minimum responsibilities:

      (1) Advise staff in developing and implementing local program policies, activities, and services to ensure they meet the needs of children and families;

      (2) Have a process for communication with the policy council and policy committee; and

      (3) Within the guidelines established by the governing body, policy council, or policy committee, participate in the recruitment and screening of Head Start employees.

      § 1301.5   Training.

#### § § 1301.5

      An agency must provide appropriate training and technical assistance or orientation to the governing body, any advisory committee members, and the policy council, including training on program performance standards and training indicated in § 1302.12(m) to ensure the members understand the information they receive and can effectively oversee and participate in the programs in the Head Start agency.

      § 1301.6   Impasse procedures.

#### § § 1301.6

      (a) To facilitate meaningful consultation and collaboration about decisions of the governing body and the policy council, each agency's governing body and policy council jointly must establish written procedures for resolving internal disputes between the governing board and policy council in a timely manner that include impasse procedures. These procedures must:

      (1) Demonstrate that the governing body considers proposed decisions from the policy council and that the policy council considers proposed decisions from the governing body;

      (2) If there is a disagreement, require the governing body and the policy council to notify the other in writing why it does not accept a decision; and,

      (3) Describe a decision-making process and a timeline to resolve disputes and reach decisions that are not arbitrary, capricious, or illegal.

      (b) If the agency's decision-making process does not result in a resolution and an impasse continues, the governing body and policy council must select a mutually agreeable third party mediator and participate in a formal process of mediation that leads to a resolution of the dispute.

      (c) For all programs except American Indian and Alaska Native programs, if no resolution is reached with a mediator, the governing body and policy council must select a mutually agreeable arbitrator whose decision is final.

### Part 1302

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 9801

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 61412, Sept. 6, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Eligibility, Recruitment, Selection, Enrollment, and Attendance

        § 1302.10   Purpose.

#### § § 1302.10

        This subpart describes requirements of grant recipients for determining community strengths, needs and resources as well as recruitment areas. It contains requirements and procedures for the eligibility determination, recruitment, selection, enrollment and attendance of children and explains the policy concerning the charging of fees.

> [81 FR 61412, Sept. 6, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 67806, Aug. 21, 2024]

        § 1302.11   Determining community strengths, needs, and resources.

#### § § 1302.11

        (a)  (1) A program must propose a service area in the grant application and define the area by county or sub-county area, such as a municipality, town or census tract or jurisdiction of a federally recognized Indian reservation.

        (i) A tribal program may propose a service area that includes areas where members of Indian tribes or those eligible for such membership reside, including but not limited to Indian reservation land, areas designated as near-reservation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provided that the service area is approved by the tribe's governing council, Alaska Native Villages, Alaska Native Regional Corporations with land-based authorities, Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas, and Tribal Designated Statistical Areas where federally recognized Indian tribes do not have a federally established reservation.

        (ii) If the tribe's service area includes any area specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and that area is also served by another program, the tribe may serve children from families who are members of or eligible to be members of such tribe and who reside in such areas as well as children from families who are not members of the tribe, but who reside within the tribe's established service area.

        (2) If a program decides to change the service area after ACF has approved its grant application, the program must submit to ACF a new service area proposal for approval.

        (b)  (1) A program must conduct a comprehensive community assessment at least once over the five-year grant period and annually review and update if any significant changes are needed as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section to:

        (i) Identify populations most in need of services including prevalent social or economic factors, challenges, and barriers experienced by families and children;

        (ii) Inform the program's design and to ensure equitable, inclusive, and accessible service delivery that reflect needs and diversity of the community;

        (iii) Inform the enrollment, recruitment, and selection process to prioritize the enrollment of those populations with relevant circumstances identified under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;

        (iv) Identify strengths and resources in the community that can be leveraged for service delivery, coordination, and partnership efforts for education, health, nutrition, and referrals to social services to eligible children and families; and,

        (v) Identify the communication methods and modalities available to the program that best engage with prospective and enrolled families in accessible ways.

        (2) In conducting the community assessment, a program must collect and utilize data that describes community strengths, needs, and resources and include, at a minimum:

        (i) Relevant demographic data about eligible children and expectant mothers, including:

        (A) Race and ethnicity;

        (B) Children living in poverty;

        (C) Children experiencing homelessness in collaboration with, to the extent possible, McKinney-Vento Local Education Agency Liaisons (42 U.S.C. 11432 (6)(A));

        (D) Children in foster care;

        (E) Children with disabilities, including types of disabilities and relevant services and resources provided to these children by community agencies; and

        (F) Geographic location and languages they speak;

        (ii) The education, health, nutrition and social service needs of eligible children and their families, including prevalent social or economic factors, challenges, and barriers to program participation such as transportation needs;

        (iii) Typical work, school, and training schedules of parents with eligible children;

        (iv) Other child development, child care centers, and family child care programs that serve eligible children, including home visiting, publicly funded State and local preschools, and the approximate number of eligible children served and their ages;

        (v) Resources that are available in the community to address the needs of eligible children and their families, especially transportation resources, and culturally appropriate and responsive supports;

        (vi) Strengths of the community; and,

        (vii) Gaps in community resources in areas relevant to addressing the needs of eligible children and their families such as gaps in health and human services, housing assistance, food assistance, employment assistance, early childhood development, and social services.

        (3) Programs should have a strategic approach:

        (i) To determine what data to acquire to reach goals in paragraph (b)(1) of this section prior to conducting the community assessment; and

        (ii) For how to use the data acquired to reach goals in paragraph (b)(1) of this section after conducting the community assessment.

        (4) When determining what data to acquire under paragraph (b)(2) of this section programs should consider what information is most relevant to inform services for families most in need. Data gathering should be informed by the program's understanding of the community and be intentionally designed to help the program identify community strengths, needs and resources, and plan the program accordingly. Programs are not required to collect all information themselves; rather programs should utilize community partners and utilize existing available data sources relevant to the local community.

        (5) A program must annually review and, where needed, update the community assessment to identify any significant shifts in community demographics, needs, and resources that may impact program design and service delivery. As described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, programs should consider results from their self-assessment as required in subpart J of this part (§§ 1302.101 through 1302.103) and their annual funding application to inform this process. The annual update review must consider at a minimum: changes related to children and families experiencing homelessness; how the program addresses equity, accessibility, and inclusiveness in its provision of services; and changes to the availability of publicly funded pre-kindergarten and whether it meets needs of families. Programs must consider how the annual review and update can inform and support management approaches for continuous quality improvement, program goals, and ongoing oversight.

        (6) A program must consider whether the characteristics of the community allow it to include children from diverse economic backgrounds that would be supported by other funding sources, including private pay, in addition to the program's eligible funded enrollment. A program must not enroll children from diverse economic backgrounds if it would result in a program serving less than its eligible funded enrollment.

        § 1302.12   Determining, verifying, and documenting eligibility.

#### § § 1302.12

        (a)  (1) Program staff must:

        (i) Conduct an in-person interview with each family, unless paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies;

        (ii) Verify information as required in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section; and,

        (iii) Create an eligibility determination record for enrolled participants according to paragraph (k) of this section.

        (2) Program staff may interview the family over the telephone if an in-person interview is not possible or convenient for the family.

        (3) If a program has an alternate method to reasonably determine eligibility based on its community assessment, geographic and administrative data, or from other reliable data sources, it may petition the responsible HHS official to waive requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

        (b)  (1) For Early Head Start, except when the child is transitioning to Head Start Preschool, a child must be an infant or a toddler younger than three years old.

        (2) For Head Start Preschool, a child must:

        (i) Be at least three years old or, turn three years old by the date used to determine eligibility for public school in the community in which the Head Start Preschool program is located; and,

        (ii) Be no older than the age required to attend school.

        (3) For Migrant or Seasonal Head Start, a child must be younger than compulsory school age by the date used to determine public school eligibility for the community in which the program is located.

        (c)  (1) A pregnant woman or a child is eligible if:

        (i) The family's income is equal to or below the poverty line; or,

        (ii) The family is eligible for or, in the absence of child care, would be potentially eligible for public assistance; including TANF child-only payments; or,

        (iii) The child is homeless, as defined in part 1305; or,

        (iv) The child is in foster care.

        (2) If the family does not meet a criterion under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a program may enroll a child who would benefit from services, provided that these participants only make up to 10 percent of a program's enrollment in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d)  (1) A program may enroll an additional 35 percent of participants whose families do not meet a criterion described in paragraph (c) of this section and whose incomes are below 130 percent of the poverty line, if the program:

        (i) Establishes and implements outreach, and enrollment policies and procedures to ensure it is meeting the needs of eligible pregnant women, children, and children with disabilities, before serving pregnant women or children who do not meet the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section; and,

        (ii) Establishes criteria that ensure pregnant women and children eligible under the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section are served first.

        (2) If a program chooses to enroll participants who do not meet a criterion in paragraph (c) of this section, and whose family incomes are between 100 and 130 percent of the poverty line, it must be able to report to the Head Start regional program office:

        (i) How it is meeting the needs of low-income families or families potentially eligible for public assistance, homeless children, and children in foster care, and include local demographic data on these populations;

        (ii) Outreach and enrollment policies and procedures that ensure it is meeting the needs of eligible children or pregnant women, before serving over-income children or pregnant women;

        (iii) Efforts, including outreach, to be fully enrolled with eligible pregnant women or children;

        (iv) Policies, procedures, and selection criteria it uses to serve eligible children;

        (v) Its current enrollment and its enrollment for the previous year;

        (vi) The number of pregnant women and children served, disaggregated by the eligibility criteria in paragraphs (c) and (d)(1) of this section; and,

        (vii) The eligibility criteria category of each child on the program's waiting list.

        (e)  (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, a Tribal program may determine any pregnant women or children in the approved service area to be eligible for services regardless of income, if they meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) An Indian Tribe or Tribes that operates both an Early Head Start program and a Head Start Preschool program may, at its discretion, at any time during the grant period involved, reallocate funds between the Early Head Start program and the Head Start Preschool program in order to address fluctuations in client populations, including pregnant women and children from birth to compulsory school age. The reallocation of such funds between programs by an Indian Tribe or Tribes during a year may not serve as a basis for any reduction of the base grant for either program in succeeding years.

        (f)  Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, pregnant women and children are eligible for Migrant or Seasonal Head Start if they have at least one family member whose income comes primarily from agricultural employment as defined in section 3 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1802), and if they meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (g)  (1) A program may establish its own criteria for eligibility provided that it meets the criteria outlined in section 645(a)(2) of the Act.

        (2) No child residing in such community whose family is eligible under criteria described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, may be denied an opportunity to participate in the program under the eligibility criteria established under this paragraph (g).

        (h)  Program staff must verify a child's age according to program policies and procedures. A program's policies and procedures cannot require families to provide documents that confirm a child's age, if doing so creates a barrier for the family to enroll the child.

        (i)  (1) To verify eligibility based on income, program staff must use tax forms, pay stubs, or other proof of income to determine the family income for the relevant time period.

        (i) The program must calculate total gross income using applicable sources of income.

        (ii) A program may make an adjustment to a family's gross income calculation for the purposes of determining eligibility to account for excessive housing costs. A program may use available bills, bank statements, and other relevant documentation provided by the family to calculate total annual housing costs with appropriate multipliers to:

        (A) Determine if a family spends more than 30 percent of their total gross income on housing costs, as defined in part 1305 of this chapter; and

        (B) If applicable, reduce the total gross income by the amount spent on housing costs that exceed more than 30 percent.

        (iii) If the family cannot provide tax forms, pay stubs, or other proof of income for the relevant time period, program staff may accept written statements from employers, including individuals who are self-employed, for the relevant time period and use information provided to calculate total annual income with appropriate multipliers.

        (iv) If the family reports no income for the relevant time period, a program may accept the family's signed declaration to that effect, if program staff describes efforts made to verify the family's income, and explains how the family's total income was calculated or seeks information from third parties about the family's eligibility, if the family gives written consent. If a family gives consent to contact third parties, program staff must adhere to program safety and privacy policies and procedures and ensure the eligibility determination record adheres to paragraph (k)(2) of this section.

        (v) If the family can demonstrate a significant change in income for the relevant time period, program staff may consider current income circumstances.

        (2) To verify whether a family is eligible for, or in the absence of child care, would be potentially eligible for public assistance, the program must have documentation from either the state, local, or tribal public assistance agency that shows the family either receives public assistance or that shows the family is potentially eligible to receive public assistance.

        (3) To verify whether a family is homeless, a program may accept a written statement from a homeless services provider, school personnel, or other service agency attesting that the child is homeless or any other documentation that indicates homelessness, including documentation from a public or private agency, a declaration, information gathered on enrollment or application forms, or notes from an interview with staff to establish the child is homeless; or any other document that establishes homelessness.

        (i) If a family can provide one of the documents described in this paragraph (i)(3), program staff must describe efforts made to verify the accuracy of the information provided and state whether the family is eligible because they are homeless.

        (ii) If a family cannot provide one of the documents described in this paragraph (i)(3) to prove the child is homeless, a program may accept the family's signed declaration to that effect, if, in a written statement, program staff describe the child's living situation that meets the definition of homeless in part 1305 of this chapter.

        (iii) Program staff may seek information from third parties who have firsthand knowledge about a family's living situation, if the family gives written consent. If the family gives consent to contact third parties, program staff must adhere to program privacy policies and procedures and ensure the eligibility determination record adheres to paragraph (k) of this section.

        (4) To verify whether a child is in foster care, program staff must accept either a court order or other legal or government-issued document, a written statement from a government child welfare official that demonstrates the child is in foster care, or proof of a foster care payment.

        (j)  (1) If a child is determined eligible under this section and is participating in a Head Start program, he or she will remain eligible through the end of the succeeding program year except that the Head Start program may choose not to enroll a child when there are compelling reasons for the child not to remain in Head Start, such as when there is a change in the child's family income and there is a child with a greater need for Head Start services.

        (2) Children who are enrolled in a program receiving funds under the authority of section 645A of the Act remain eligible while they participate in the program.

        (3) If a child moves from an Early Head Start program to a Head Start Preschool program, program staff must verify the family's eligibility again.

        (4) If a program operates both an Early Head Start and a Head Start Preschool program, and the parents wish to enroll their child who has been enrolled in the program's Early Head Start, the program must ensure, whenever possible, the child receives Head Start Preschool services until enrolled in school, provided the child is eligible.

        (5) If a program operates a Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program, children younger than age three participating in the program remain eligible until they turn three years old consistent with paragraph (j)(2) of this section.

        (k)  (1) A program must keep eligibility determination records for each participant and ongoing records of the eligibility training for staff required by paragraph (m) of this section. A program may keep these records electronically.

        (2) Each eligibility determination record must include:

        (i) Copies of any documents or statements, including declarations, that are deemed necessary to verify eligibility under paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section;

        (ii) A statement that program staff has made reasonable efforts to verify information by:

        (A) Conducting either an in-person, or a telephone interview with the family as described under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(2) of this section; and,

        (B) Describing efforts made to verify eligibility, as required under paragraphs (h) through (i) of this section; and, collecting documents required for third party verification that includes the family's written consent to contact each third party, the third parties' names, titles, and affiliations, and information from third parties regarding the family's eligibility.

        (iii) A statement that identifies whether:

        (A) The family's income is below income guidelines for its size, and lists the family's size;

        (B) The family is eligible for or, in the absence of child care, potentially eligible for public assistance;

        (C) The child is a homeless child or the child is in foster care;

        (D) The family was determined to be eligible under the criterion in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or,

        (E) The family was determined to be eligible under the criterion in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (3) A program must keep eligibility determination records for those currently enrolled, as long as they are enrolled, and, for one year after they have either stopped receiving services; or are no longer enrolled.

        (l)  A program must establish written policies and procedures that describe all actions taken against staff who intentionally violate Federal and program eligibility determination regulations and who enroll pregnant women and children that are not eligible to receive Head Start services.

        (m)  (1) A program must train all governing body, policy council, management, and staff who determine eligibility on applicable federal regulations and program policies and procedures. Training must, at a minimum:

        (i) Include methods on how to collect complete and accurate eligibility information from families and third party sources;

        (ii) Incorporate strategies for treating families with dignity and respect and for dealing with possible issues of domestic violence, stigma, and privacy; and,

        (iii) Explain program policies and procedures that describe actions taken against staff, families, or participants who attempt to provide or intentionally provide false information.

        (2) A program must train management and staff members who make eligibility determinations within 90 days of hiring new staff.

        (3) A program must train all governing body and policy council members within 180 days of the beginning of the term of a new governing body or policy council.

        (4) A program must develop policies on how often training will be provided after the initial training.

        § 1302.13   Recruitment of children.

#### § § 1302.13

        In order to reach those most in need of services, a program must develop and implement a recruitment process designed to actively inform all families with eligible children within the recruitment area of the availability of program services. A program must include modern technologies to encourage and assist families in applying for admission to the program, and to reduce the family's administrative and paperwork burden in the application and enrollment process. A program must include specific efforts to actively locate and recruit children with disabilities and other children in need, including children experiencing homelessness and children in foster care.

> [89 FR 67807, Aug. 21, 2024]

        § 1302.14   Selection process.

#### § § 1302.14

        (a)  (1) A program must annually establish selection criteria that weigh the prioritization of selection of participants, based on community needs identified in the community needs assessment as described in § 1302.11(b), and including family income, whether the child is homeless, whether the child is in foster care, the child's age, whether the child is eligible for special education and related services, or early intervention services, as appropriate, as determined under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1400 ) and, other relevant family or child risk factors.

        (2) An Indian Tribe that operates a Head Start program must annually establish selection criteria that weigh the prioritization of selection of participants, based on community needs identified in the community needs assessment as described in § 1302.11(b), and may, at its discretion, give priority to children in families for which a child, a family member, or a member of the same household, is a member of an Indian Tribe, and would benefit from the Head Start program.

        (3) If a program serves migrant or seasonal families, it must annually establish selection criteria that weigh the prioritization of selection of participants, based on community needs identified in the community needs assessment as described in § 1302.11(b), and give priority to children whose families can demonstrate they have relocated frequently within the past two-years to pursue agricultural work.

        (4) If a program operates in a service area where Head Start Preschool eligible children can enroll in high-quality publicly funded pre-kindergarten for a full school day, the program must prioritize younger children as part of the selection criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If this priority would disrupt partnerships with local education agencies, then it is not required. An American Indian and Alaska Native or Migrant or Seasonal Head Start program must consider whether such prioritization is appropriate in their community.

        (5) A program must not deny enrollment based on a disability or chronic health condition or its severity.

        (6) A program may consider the enrollment of children of staff members as part of the selection criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (b)  (1) A program must ensure at least 10 percent of its total actual enrollment is filled by children eligible for services under IDEA, unless the responsible HHS official grants a waiver.

        (2) If the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section has been met, children eligible for services under IDEA should be prioritized for the available slots in accordance with the program's selection criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  A program must develop at the beginning of each enrollment year and maintain during the year a waiting list that ranks children according to the program's selection criteria.

        (d)  A program is required to use data from the community assessment to identify the population of eligible children and families and potential barriers to enrollment and attendance, including using data to understand access to transportation for the highest need families. A program must use this data to inform ongoing program improvement efforts as described in § 1302.102(c) to promote enrolling the children most in need of program services.

        § 1302.15   Enrollment.

#### § § 1302.15

        (a)  A program must maintain its funded enrollment level and fill any vacancy as soon as possible. A program must fill any vacancy within 30 days.

        (b)  (1) A program must make efforts to maintain enrollment of eligible children for the following year.

        (2) Under exceptional circumstances, a program may maintain a child's enrollment in Head Start Preschool for a third year, provided that family income is verified again. A program may maintain a child's enrollment in Early Head Start as described in § 1302.12(j)(2).

        (3) If a program serves homeless children or children in foster care, it must make efforts to maintain the child's enrollment regardless of whether the family or child moves to a different service area, or transition the child to a program in a different service area, as required in § 1302.72(a), according to the family's needs.

        (c)  If a program determines from the community assessment there are families experiencing homelessness in the area, or children in foster care that could benefit from services, the program may reserve one or more enrollment slots for pregnant women and children experiencing homelessness and children in foster care, when a vacancy occurs. No more than three percent of a program's funded enrollment slots may be reserved. If the reserved enrollment slot is not filled within 30 days, the enrollment slot becomes vacant and then must be filled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d)  Children from diverse economic backgrounds who are funded with other sources, including private pay, are not considered part of a program's eligible funded enrollment.

        (e)  A program must comply with state immunization enrollment and attendance requirements, with the exception of homeless children as described in § 1302.16(c)(1).

        (f)  Parent participation in any program activity is voluntary, including consent for data sharing, and is not required as a condition of the child's enrollment.

        (g)  A program must regularly examine their enrollment processes and implement any identified improvements to streamline the enrollment experience for families.

        § 1302.16   Attendance.

#### § § 1302.16

        (a)  A program must track attendance for each child.

        (1) A program must implement a process to ensure children are safe when they do not arrive at school. If a child is unexpectedly absent and a parent has not contacted the program within one hour of program start time, the program must attempt to contact the parent to ensure the child's well-being.

        (2) A program must implement strategies to promote attendance. At a minimum, a program must:

        (i) Provide information about the benefits of regular attendance;

        (ii) Support families to promote the child's regular attendance;

        (iii) Conduct a home visit or make other direct contact with a child's parents if a child has multiple unexplained absences (such as two consecutive unexplained absences);

        (iv) Within the first 60 days of program operation, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, use individual child attendance data to identify children with patterns of absence that put them at risk of missing ten percent of program days per year and develop appropriate strategies to improve individual attendance among identified children, such as direct contact with parents or intensive case management, as necessary; and

        (v) Examine barriers to regular attendance, such as access to safe and reliable transportation, and where possible, provide or facilitate transportation for the child if needed.

        (3) If a child ceases to attend, the program must make appropriate efforts to reengage the family to resume attendance, including as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the child's attendance does not resume, then the program must consider that slot vacant. This action is not considered expulsion as described in § 1302.17.

        (b)  If a program's monthly average daily attendance rate falls below 85 percent, the program must analyze the causes of absenteeism to identify any systematic issues that contribute to the program's absentee rate. The program must use this data to make necessary changes in a timely manner as part of ongoing oversight and correction as described in § 1302.102(b) and inform its continuous improvement efforts as described in § 1302.102(c).

        (c)  (1) If a program determines a child is eligible under § 1302.12(c)(1)(iii), it must allow the child to attend for up to 90 days or as long as allowed under state licensing requirements, without immunization and other records, to give the family reasonable time to present these documents. A program must work with families to get children immunized as soon as possible in order to comply with state licensing requirements.

        (2) If a child experiencing homelessness is unable to attend classes regularly because the family does not have transportation to and from the program facility, the program must utilize community resources, where possible, to provide transportation for the child.

        § 1302.17   Suspension and expulsion.

#### § § 1302.17

        (a)  (1) A program must prohibit or severely limit the use of suspension due to a child's behavior. Such suspensions may only be temporary in nature.

        (2) A temporary suspension must be used only as a last resort in extraordinary circumstances where there is a serious safety threat that has not been reduced or eliminated by the provision of interventions and supports recommended by the mental health consultant and the program needs time to put additional appropriate services in place.

        (3) Before a program determines whether a temporary suspension is necessary, a program must engage with a mental health consultant, collaborate with the parents, and utilize appropriate community resources—such as behavior coaches, psychologists, other appropriate specialists, or other resources—as needed, to determine no other reasonable option is appropriate.

        (4) If a temporary suspension is deemed necessary, a program must help the child return to full participation in all program activities as quickly as possible while ensuring child safety. A program must explore all possible steps and document all steps taken to address the behavior(s) and supports needed to facilitate the child's safe reentry and continued participation in the program. Such steps must include, at a minimum:

        (i) Continuing to engage with the parents, mental health consultant, and other appropriate staff, and continuing to utilize appropriate community resources;

        (ii) Providing additional program supports and services, including home visits; and,

        (iii) Determining whether a referral to a local agency responsible for implementing IDEA is appropriate, or if the child has an individualized family service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP), consulting with the responsible agency to ensure the child receives the needed support services.

        (b)  (1) A program cannot expel or unenroll a child from Head Start because of a child's behavior.

        (2) When a child exhibits persistent and serious behavioral concerns, a program must explore all possible steps and document all steps taken to address such problems, and facilitate the child's safe participation in the program. Such steps must include, at a minimum, engaging a mental health consultant, considering the appropriateness of providing appropriate services and supports under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to ensure that the child who satisfies the definition of disability in 29 U.S.C. 705(9)(b) of the Rehabilitation Act is not excluded from the program on the basis of disability, and consulting with the parents and the child's teacher, and:

        (i) If the child has an individualized family service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP), the program must consult with the agency responsible for the IFSP or IEP to ensure the child receives the needed support services; or,

        (ii) If the child does not have an IFSP or IEP, the program must collaborate, with parental consent, with the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA to determine the child's eligibility for services.

        (3) If, after a program has explored all possible steps and documented all steps taken as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a program, in consultation with the parents, the child's teacher, the agency responsible for implementing IDEA (if applicable), and the mental health consultant, determines that the child's continued enrollment presents a continued serious safety threat to the child or other enrolled children and determines the program is not the most appropriate placement for the child, the program must work with such entities to directly facilitate the transition of the child to a more appropriate placement.

        § 1302.18   Fees.

#### § § 1302.18

        (a) A program must not charge eligible families a fee to participate in Head Start, including special events such as field trips, and cannot in any way condition an eligible child's enrollment or participation in the program upon the payment of a fee.

        (b) (1) A program must only accept a fee from families of enrolled children for services that are in addition to services funded by Head Start, such as child care before or after funded Head Start hours. A program may not condition a Head Start child's enrollment on the ability to pay a fee for additional hours.

        (2) In order to support programs serving children from diverse economic backgrounds or using multiple funding sources, a program may charge fees to private pay families and other non-Head Start enrolled families to the extent allowed by any other applicable federal, state or local funding sources.

      Subpart B—Program Structure

        § 1302.20   Determining program structure.

#### § § 1302.20

        (a)  (1) A program must choose to operate one or more of the following program options: center- based, home-based, family child care, or an approved locally designed variation as described in § 1302.24. The program option(s) chosen must meet the needs of children and families based on the community assessment described in § 1302.11(b). A Head Start Preschool program may not provide only the option described in § 1302.22(a) and (c)(2).

        (2) To choose a program option and develop a program calendar, a program must consider in conjunction with the annual review of the community assessment described in § 1302.11(b)(2), whether it would better meet child and family needs through conversion of existing slots to full school day or full working day slots, extending the program year, conversion of existing Head Start Preschool slots to Early Head Start slots as described in paragraph (c) of this section, and ways to promote continuity of care and services. A program must work to identify alternate sources to support full working day services. If no additional funding is available, program resources may be used.

        (b)  All program options must deliver the full range of services, as described in subparts C, D, E, F, and G of this part, except that §§ 1302.30 through 1302.32 and § 1302.34 do not apply to home-based options.

        (c)  (1) Consistent with section 645(a)(5) of the Head Start Act, grant recipients may request to convert Head Start Preschool slots to Early Head Start slots through the refunding application process or as a separate grant amendment.

        (2) Any grant recipient proposing a conversion of Head Start Preschool services to Early Head Start services must obtain policy council and governing body approval and submit the request to their regional office.

        (3) With the exception of American Indian and Alaska Native grant recipients as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the request to the regional office must include:

        (i) A grant application budget and a budget narrative that clearly identifies the funding amount for the Head Start Preschool and Early Head Start programs before and after the proposed conversion;

        (ii) The results of the community assessment demonstrating how the proposed use of funds would best meet the needs of the community, including a description of how the needs of eligible Head Start children will be met in the community when the conversion takes places;

        (iii) A revised program schedule that describes the program option(s) and the number of funded enrollment slots for Head Start Preschool and Early Head Start programs before and after the proposed conversion;

        (iv) A description of how the needs of pregnant women, infants, and toddlers will be addressed;

        (v) A discussion of the agency's capacity to carry out an effective Early Head Start program in accordance with the requirements of section 645A(b) of the Head Start Act and all applicable regulations;

        (vi) Assurances that the agency will participate in training and technical assistance activities required of all Early Head Start grant recipients;

        (vii) A discussion of the qualifications and competencies of the child development staff proposed for the Early Head Start program, as well as a description of the facilities and program infrastructure that will be used to support the new or expanded Early Head Start program;

        (viii) A discussion of any one-time funding necessary to implement the proposed conversion and how the agency intends to secure such funding; and,

        (ix) The proposed timetable for implementing this conversion, including updating school readiness goals as described in subpart J of this part.

        (4) Consistent with section 645(d)(3) of the Act, any American Indian and Alaska Native grant recipient that operates both an Early Head Start program and a Head Start Preschool program may reallocate funds between the programs at its discretion and at any time during the grant period involved, in order to address fluctuations in client populations. An American Indian and Alaska Native program that exercises this discretion must notify the regional office.

        (d)  A program may consider hours of service that meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards, regardless of the source of funding, as hours of planned class operations for the purposes of meeting the Head Start Preschool and Early Head Start service duration requirements in this subpart.

> [81 FR 61412, Sept. 6, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 67808, Aug. 21, 2024]

        § 1302.21   Center-based option.

#### § § 1302.21

        (a)  The center-based option delivers the full range of services, consistent with § 1302.20(b). Education and child development services are delivered primarily in classroom settings.

        (b) (1) Staff-child ratios and group size maximums must be determined by the age of the majority of children and the needs of children present. A program must determine the age of the majority of children in a class at the start of the year and may adjust this determination during the program year, if necessary. Where state or local licensing requirements are more stringent than the teacher-child ratios and group size specifications in this section, a program must meet the stricter requirements. A program must maintain appropriate ratios during all hours of program operation, except:

        (i) For brief absences of a teaching staff member for no more than five minutes; and,

        (ii) During nap time, one teaching staff member may be replaced by one staff member or trained volunteer who does not meet the teaching qualifications required for the age.

        (2) An Early Head Start or Migrant or Seasonal Head Start class that serves children under 36 months old must have two teachers with no more than eight children, or three teachers with no more than nine children. Each teacher must be assigned consistent, primary responsibility for no more than four children to promote continuity of care for individual children. A program must minimize teacher changes throughout a child's enrollment, whenever possible, and consider mixed age group classes to support continuity of care.

        (3) A class that serves a majority of children who are three years old must have no more than 17 children with a teacher and teaching assistant or two teachers. A double session class that serves a majority of children who are three years old must have no more than 15 children with a teacher and teaching assistant or two teachers.

        (4) A class that serves a majority of children who are four and five years old must have no more than 20 children with a teacher and a teaching assistant or two teachers. A double session class that serves a majority of children who are four and five years old must have no more than 17 children with a teacher and a teaching assistant or two teachers.

        (c) —(1)  (i) A program must provide 1,380 annual hours of planned class operations for all enrolled children.

        (ii) A program that is designed to meet the needs of young parents enrolled in school settings may meet the service duration requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if it operates a center-based program schedule during the school year aligned with its local education agency requirements and provides regular home-based services during the summer break.

        (2) —(i)  A program must provide 1,020 annual hours of planned class operation over the course of at least eight months per year for at least 45 percent of its _Head Start Preschool_ center-based funded enrollment.

        (ii)  A program must provide, at a minimum, at least 160 days per year of planned class operations if it operates for five days per week, or at least 128 days per year if it operates four days per week. Classes must operate for a minimum of 3.5 hours per day.

        (iii)  Double session variation must provide classes for four days per week for a minimum of 128 days per year and 3.5 hours per day. Each double session class staff member must be provided adequate break time during the course of the day. In addition, teachers, assistants, and volunteers must have appropriate time to prepare for each session together, to set up the classroom environment, and to give individual attention to children entering and leaving the center.

        (iv)  A Head Start Preschool program providing fewer than 1,020 annual hours of planned class operations or fewer than eight months of service is considered to meet the requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if its program schedule aligns with the annual hours required by its local education agency for grade one and such alignment is necessary to support partnerships for service delivery.

        (3)  A Migrant or Seasonal program is not subject to the requirements described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, but must make every effort to provide as many days and hours of service as possible to each child and family.

        (4)  A program must:

        (i) Plan its year using a reasonable estimate of the number of days during a year that classes may be closed due to problems such as inclement weather; and,

        (ii) Make every effort to schedule makeup days using existing resources if hours of planned class operations fall below the number required per year.

        (d)  (1) The facilities used by a program must meet state, tribal, or local licensing requirements, even if exempted by the licensing entity. When state, tribal, or local requirements vary from Head Start requirements, the most stringent provision takes precedence.

        (2) A center-based program must have at least 35 square feet of usable indoor space per child available for the care and use of children (exclusive of bathrooms, halls, kitchen, staff rooms, and storage places) and at least 75 square feet of usable outdoor play space per child.

        (3) A program that operates two or more groups within an area must ensure clearly defined, safe divisions to separate groups. A program must ensure such spaces are learning environments that facilitate the implementation of the requirements in subpart C of this part. The divisions must limit noise transfer from one group to another to prevent disruption of an effective learning environment.

        § 1302.22   Home-based option.

#### § § 1302.22

        (a)  The home-based option delivers the full range of services, consistent with § 1302.20(b), through visits with the child's parents, primarily in the child's home and through group socialization opportunities in a Head Start classroom, community facility, home, or on field trips. For Early Head Start programs, the home-based option may be used to deliver services to some or all of a program's enrolled children. For Head Start Preschool programs, the home-based option may only be used to deliver services to a portion of a program's enrolled children.

        (b)  A program that implements a home-based option must maintain an average caseload of 10 to 12 families per home visitor with a maximum of 12 families for any individual home visitor.

        (c) —(1)  By August 1, 2017, an Early Head Start home-based program must:

        (i) Provide one home visit per week per family that lasts at least an hour and a half and provide a minimum of 46 visits per year; and,

        (ii) Provide, at a minimum, 22 group socialization activities distributed over the course of the program year.

        (2)  A Head Start Preschool home-based program must:

        (i) Provide one home visit per week per family that lasts at least an hour and a half and provide a minimum of 32 visits per year; and,

        (ii) Provide, at a minimum, 16 group socialization activities distributed over the course of the program year.

        (3)  A program that implements a home-based option must:

        (i) Make up planned home visits or scheduled group socialization activities that were canceled by the program, and to the extent possible attempt to make up planned home visits canceled by the family, when this is necessary to meet the minimums described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; and,

        (ii) Not replace home visits or scheduled group socialization activities for medical or social service appointments for the purposes of meeting the minimum requirements described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (d)  The areas for learning, playing, sleeping, toileting, preparing food, and eating in facilities used for group socializations in the home-based option must meet the safety standards described in § 1302.47(1)(ii) through (viii).

        § 1302.23   Family child care option.

#### § § 1302.23

        (a)  The family child care program option delivers the full range of services, consistent with § 1302.20(b). Education and child development services are primarily delivered by a family child care provider in their home or other family-like setting. A program may choose to offer the family child care option if:

        (1) The program has a legally binding agreement with one or more family child care provider(s) that clearly defines the roles, rights, and responsibilities of each party, or the program is the employer of the family child care provider, and ensures children and families enrolled in this option receive the full range of services described in subparts C, D, E, F, and G of this part; and,

        (2) The program ensures family child care homes are available that can accommodate children and families with disabilities.

        (b) —(1)  A program that operates the family child care option where Head Start children are enrolled must ensure group size does not exceed the limits specified in this section. If the family child care provider's own children under the age of six are present, they must be included in the group size.

        (2)  When there is one family child care provider, with a mixed-age group of children that includes children over 36 months of age, the maximum group size is six children and no more than two of the six may be under 24 months of age. When there are two providers, the maximum group size is twelve children with no more than four of the twelve children under 24 months of age.

        (3)  When there is one family child care provider with a group of children that are all under 36 months of age, the maximum group size is four children, and no more than two of the four children may be under 18 months of age.

        (4)  A program must maintain appropriate ratios during all hours of program operation. A program must ensure providers have systems to ensure the safety of any child not within view for any period. A program must make substitute staff available with the necessary training and experience to ensure quality services to children are not interrupted.

        (c)  Whether family child care option services are provided directly or via contractual arrangement, a program must ensure family child care providers operate sufficient hours to meet the child care needs of families and not less than 1,380 hours per year.

        (d)  A family child-care provider must be licensed by the state, tribal, or local entity to provide services in their home or family-like setting. When state, tribal, or local requirements vary from Head Start requirements, the most stringent provision applies.

        (e)  A program that offers the family child care option must provide a child development specialist to support family child care providers and ensure the provision of quality services at each family child care home. Child development specialists must:

        (1) Conduct regular visits to each home, some of which are unannounced, not less than once every two weeks;

        (2) Periodically verify compliance with either contract requirements or agency policy;

        (3) Facilitate ongoing communication between program staff, family child care providers, and enrolled families; and,

        (4) Provide recommendations for technical assistance and support the family child care provider in developing relationships with other child care professionals.

        § 1302.24   Locally-designed program option variations.

#### § § 1302.24

        (a)  Programs may request to operate a locally-designed program option, including a combination of program options, to better meet the unique needs of their communities or to demonstrate or test alternative approaches for providing program services. In order to operate a locally-designed program option, programs must seek a waiver as described in this section and must deliver the full range of services, consistent with § 1302.20(b), and demonstrate how any change to their program design is consistent with achieving program goals in subpart J of this part.

        (b)  A program's request to operate a locally-designed variation may be approved by the responsible HHS official through the end of a program's current grant or, if the request is submitted through a grant application for an upcoming project period, for the project period of the new award. Such approval may be revoked based on progress toward program goals as described in § 1302.102 and monitoring as described in § 1304.2.

        (c)  (1) The responsible HHS official may waive one or more of the requirements contained in §§ 1302.21(b), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(2)(i); 1302.22(a) through (c); and 1302.23(b) and (c) but may not waive ratios or group size for children under 24 months. Center-based locally designed options must meet the minimums described in section 640(k)(1) of the Act for center-based programs.

        (2) If the responsible HHS official determines a waiver of group size for center-based services would better meet the needs of children and families in a community, the group size may not exceed the limits below:

        (i) A group that serves children 24 to 36 months of age must have no more than ten children; and,

        § 1302.30   Purpose.

#### § § 1302.30

        All programs must provide high-quality early education and child development services, including for children with disabilities, that promote children's cognitive, social, and emotional growth for later success in school. A center-based or family child care program must embed responsive and effective teacher-child interactions. A home-based program must promote secure parent-child relationships and help parents provide high-quality early learning experiences. All programs must implement a research-based curriculum, and screening and assessment procedures that support individualization and growth in the areas of development described in the  and support family engagement in children's learning and development. A program must deliver developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate learning experiences in language, literacy, mathematics, social and emotional functioning, approaches to learning, science, physical skills, and creative arts. To deliver such high-quality early education and child development services, a center-based or family child care program must implement, at a minimum, the elements contained in §§ 1302.31 through 1302.34, and a home-based program must implement, at a minimum, the elements in §§ 1302.33 and 1302.35.

A program must also support implementation of such environment with integration of regular and ongoing supervision and a system of individualized and ongoing professional development, as appropriate. This includes, at a minimum, the practices described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Teaching practices must:

        (i) Emphasize nurturing and responsive practices, interactions, and environments that foster trust and emotional security; are communication and language rich; promote critical thinking and problem-solving; social, emotional, behavioral, and language development; provide supportive feedback for learning; motivate continued effort; and support all children's engagement in learning experiences and activities;

        (ii) Focus on promoting growth in the developmental progressions described in the  by aligning with and using the Framework and the curricula as described in § 1302.32 to direct planning of organized activities, schedules, lesson plans, and the implementation of high-quality early learning experiences that are responsive to and build upon each child's individual pattern of development and learning;

        (iii) Integrate child assessment data in individual and group planning; and,

        (iv) Include developmentally appropriate learning experiences in language, literacy, social and emotional development, math, science, social studies, creative arts, and physical development that are focused toward achieving progress outlined in the

        (2) For dual language learners, a program must recognize bilingualism and biliteracy as strengths and implement research-based teaching practices that support their development. These practices must:

        (i) For an infant or toddler dual language learner, include teaching practices that focus on the development of the home language, when there is a teacher with appropriate language competency, and experiences that expose the child to English;

        (ii) For a preschool age dual language learner, include teaching practices that focus on both English language acquisition and the continued development of the home language; or,

        (iii) If staff do not speak the home language of all children in the learning environment, include steps to support the development of the home language for dual language learners such as having culturally and linguistically appropriate materials available and other evidence-based strategies. Programs must work to identify volunteers who speak children's home language/s who could be trained to work in the classroom to support children's continued development of the home language.

        (c)  A program must ensure teachers implement well-organized learning environments with developmentally appropriate schedules, lesson plans, and indoor and outdoor learning experiences that provide adequate opportunities for choice, play, exploration, and experimentation among a variety of learning, sensory, and motor experiences and:

        (1) For infants and toddlers, promote relational learning and include individualized and small group activities that integrate appropriate daily routines into a flexible schedule of learning experiences; and,

        (2) For preschool age children, include teacher-directed and child-initiated activities, active and quiet learning activities, and opportunities for individual, small group, and large group learning activities.

        (d)  To support implementation of the curriculum and the requirements described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section a program must provide age-appropriate equipment, materials, supplies and physical space for indoor and outdoor learning environments, including functional space. The equipment, materials and supplies must include any necessary accommodations and the space must be accessible to children with disabilities.

        (2) A program must support staff to effectively implement curricula and at a minimum monitor curriculum implementation and fidelity, and provide support, feedback, and supervision for continuous improvement of its implementation through the system of training and professional development.

        (b)  A program that chooses to make significant adaptations to a curriculum or a curriculum enhancement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to better meet the needs of one or more specific populations must use an external early childhood education curriculum or content area expert to develop such significant adaptations. A program must assess whether the adaptation adequately facilitates progress toward meeting school readiness goals, consistent with the process described in § 1302.102(b) and (c). Programs are encouraged to partner with outside evaluators in assessing such adaptations.

        § 1302.33   Child screenings and assessments.

#### § § 1302.33

        (a)  (1) In collaboration with each child's parent and with parental consent, a program must complete or obtain a current developmental screening to identify concerns regarding a child's developmental, behavioral, motor, language, social, cognitive, and emotional skills within 45 calendar days of when the child first attends the program or, for the home-based program option, receives a home visit. A program that operates for 90 days or less must complete or obtain a current developmental screening within 30 calendar days of when the child first attends the program.

        (2) A program must use one or more research-based developmental standardized screening tools to complete the screening. A program must use as part of the screening additional information from family members, teachers, and relevant staff familiar with the child's typical behavior.

        (3) If warranted through screening and additional relevant information and with direct guidance from a mental health or child development professional a program must, with the parent's consent, promptly and appropriately address any needs identified through:

        (i) Referral to the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA for a formal evaluation to assess the child's eligibility for services under IDEA as soon as possible, and not to exceed timelines required under IDEA; and,

        (ii) Partnership with the child's parents and the relevant local agency to support families through the formal evaluation process.

        (4) If a child is determined to be eligible for services under IDEA, the program must partner with parents and the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA, as appropriate, and deliver the services in subpart F of this part.

        (5) If, after the formal evaluation described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA determines the child is not eligible for early intervention or special education and related services under IDEA, the program must:

        (i) Seek guidance from a mental health or child development professional to determine if the formal evaluation shows the child has a significant delay in one or more areas of development that is likely to interfere with the child's development and school readiness; and,

        (ii) If the child has a significant delay, partner with parents to help the family access services and supports to help address the child's identified needs.

        (A) Such additional services and supports may be available through a child's health insurance or it may be appropriate for the program to provide needed services and supports under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act if the child satisfies the definition of disability in 29 U.S.C. 705(9)(b) of the Rehabilitation Act, to ensure that the child who satisfies the definition of disability in 29 U.S.C. 705(9)(b) of the Rehabilitation Act is not excluded from the program on the basis of disability.

        (B) A program may use program funds for such services and supports when no other sources of funding are available.

        (b)  (1) A program must conduct standardized and structured assessments, which may be observation-based or direct, for each child that provide ongoing information to evaluate the child's developmental level and progress in outcomes aligned to the goals described in the  Such assessments must result in usable information for teachers, home visitors, and parents and be conducted with sufficient frequency to allow for individualization within the program year.

        (2) A program must regularly use information from paragraph (b)(1) of this section along with informal teacher observations and additional information from family and staff, as relevant, to determine a child's strengths and needs, inform and adjust strategies to better support individualized learning and improve teaching practices in center-based and family child care settings, and improve home visit strategies in home-based models.

        (3) If warranted from the information gathered from paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section and with direct guidance from a mental health or child development professional and a parent's consent, a program must refer the child to the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA for a formal evaluation to assess a child's eligibility for services under IDEA.

        (c)  (1) Screenings and assessments must be valid and reliable for the population and purpose for which they will be used, including by being conducted by qualified and trained personnel, and being age, developmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and appropriate for children with disabilities, as needed.

        (2) If a program serves a child who speaks a language other than English, a program must use qualified bilingual staff, contractor, or consultant to:

        (i) Assess language skills in English and in the child's home language, to assess both the child's progress in the home language and in English language acquisition;

        (ii) Conduct screenings and assessments for domains other than language skills in the language or languages that best capture the child's development and skills in the specific domain; and,

        (iii) Ensure those conducting the screening or assessment know and understand the child's language and culture and have sufficient skill level in the child's home language to accurately administer the screening or assessment and to record and understand the child's responses, interactions, and communications.

        (3) If a program serves a child who speaks a language other than English and qualified bilingual staff, contractors, or consultants are not able to conduct screenings and assessments, a program must use an interpreter in conjunction with a qualified staff person to conduct screenings and assessments as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

        (4) If a program serves a child who speaks a language other than English and can demonstrate that there is not a qualified bilingual staff person or interpreter, then screenings and assessments may be conducted in English. In such a case, a program must also gather and use other information, including structured observations over time and information gathered in a child's home language from the family, for use in evaluating the child's development and progress.

        (d)  The use of screening and assessment items and data on any screening or assessment authorized under this subchapter by any agent of the federal government is prohibited for the purposes of ranking, comparing, or otherwise evaluating individual children for purposes other than research, training, or technical assistance, and is prohibited for the purposes of providing rewards or sanctions for individual children or staff. A program must not use screening or assessments to exclude children from enrollment or participation.

    PART 1303—FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

### Part 1303

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 9801

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 61412, Sept. 6, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Financial Requirements

        § 1303.2   Purpose.

#### § § 1303.2

        This subpart establishes regulations applicable to program administration and grants management for all grants under the Act.

        § 1303.3   Other requirements.

#### § § 1303.3

        The following chart includes HHS regulations that apply to all grants made under the Act:

        § 1303.4   Federal financial assistance, non-federal match, and waiver requirements.

#### § § 1303.4

        In accordance with section 640(b) of the Act, federal financial assistance to a grant recipient will not exceed 80 percent of the approved total program costs. A grant recipient must contribute 20 percent as non-federal match each budget period. The responsible HHS official may approve a waiver of all or a portion of the non-federal match requirement on the basis of the grant recipient's written application submitted for the budget period and any supporting evidence the responsible HHS official requires. In deciding whether to grant a waiver, the responsible HHS official will consider the circumstances specified at section 640(b) of the Act and whether the grant recipient has made a reasonable effort to comply with the non-federal match requirement.

        § 1303.5   Limitations on development and administrative costs.

#### § § 1303.5

        (a)  (1) Costs to develop and administer a program cannot be excessive or exceed 15 percent of the total approved program costs. Allowable costs to develop and administer a Head Start program cannot exceed 15 percent of the total approved program costs, which includes both federal costs and non-federal match, unless the responsible HHS official grants a waiver under paragraph (b) of this section that approves a higher percentage in order to carry out the purposes of the Act.

        (2) To assess total program costs and determine whether a grant recipient meets this requirement, the grant recipient must:

        (i) Determine the costs to develop and administer its program, including the local costs of necessary resources;

        (ii) Categorize total costs as development and administrative or program costs;

        (iii) Identify and allocate the portion of dual benefits costs that are for development and administration;

        (iv) Identify and allocate the portion of indirect costs that are for development and administration versus program costs; and,

        (v) Delineate all development and administrative costs in the grant application and calculate the percentage of total approved costs allocated to development and administration.

        (b)  (1) The responsible HHS official may grant a waiver for each budget period if a delay or disruption to program services is caused by circumstances beyond the agency's control, or if an agency is unable to administer the program within the 15 percent limitation and if the agency can demonstrate efforts to reduce its development and administrative costs.

        (2) If at any time within the grant funding cycle, a grant recipient estimates development and administration costs will exceed 15 percent of total approved costs, it must submit a waiver request to the responsible HHS official that explains why costs exceed the limit, that indicates the time period the waiver will cover, and that describes what the grant recipient will do to reduce its development and administrative costs to comply with the 15 percent limit after the waiver period.

      Subpart B—Administrative Requirements

        § 1303.10   Purpose.

#### § § 1303.10

        A grant recipient must observe standards of organization, management, and administration that will ensure, so far as reasonably possible, that all program activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Act and the objective of providing assistance effectively, efficiently, and free of any taint of partisan political bias or personal or family favoritism.

        § 1303.11   Limitations and prohibitions.

#### § § 1303.11

        An agency must adhere to sections 644(e), 644(g)(3), 653, 654, 655, 656, and 657A of the Act. These sections pertain to union organizing, the Davis-Bacon Act, limitations on compensation, nondiscrimination, unlawful activities, political activities, and obtaining parental consent.

        § 1303.12   Insurance and bonding.

#### § § 1303.12

        An agency must have an ongoing process to identify risks and have cost-effective insurance for those identified risks; a grant recipient must require the same for its delegates. The agency must specifically consider the risk of accidental injury to children while participating in the program. The grant recipient must submit proof of appropriate coverage in its initial application for funding. The process of identifying risks must also consider the risk of losses resulting from fraudulent acts by individuals authorized to disburse Head Start funds. Consistent with 45 CFR part 75, if the agency lacks sufficient coverage to protect the federal government's interest, the agency must maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage.

      Subpart C—Protections for the Privacy of Child Records

        § 1303.20   Establishing procedures.

#### § § 1303.20

        A program must establish procedures to protect the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information (PII) in child records.

        § 1303.21   Program procedures—applicable confidentiality provisions.

#### § § 1303.21

        (a) If a program is an educational agency or institution that receives funds under a program administered by the Department of Education and therefore is subject to the confidentiality provisions under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), then it must comply with those confidentiality provisions of FERPA instead of the provisions in this subpart.

        (b) If a program serves a child who is referred to, or found eligible for services under, IDEA, then a program must comply with the applicable confidentiality provisions in Part B or Part C of IDEA to protect the PII in records of those children, and, therefore, the provisions in this subpart do not apply to those children.

        § 1303.22   Disclosures with, and without, parental consent.

#### § § 1303.22

        (a)  (1) Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the procedures to protect PII must require the program to obtain a parent's written consent before the program may disclose such PII from child records.

        (2) The procedures to protect PII must require the program to ensure the parent's written consent specifies what child records may be disclosed, explains why the records will be disclosed, and identifies the party or class of parties to whom the records may be disclosed. The written consent must be signed and dated.

        (3) “Signed and dated written consent” under this part may include a record and signature in electronic form that:

        (i) Identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic consent; and,

        (ii) Indicates such person's approval of the information.

        (4) The program must explain to the parent that the granting of consent is voluntary on the part of the parent and may be revoked at any time. If a parent revokes consent, that revocation is not retroactive and therefore it does not apply to an action that occurred before the consent was revoked.

        (b)  The procedures to protect PII must allow the program to disclose such PII from child records without parental consent if the program notifies the parent about the disclosure, provides the parent, upon the parent's request, a copy of the PII from child records to be disclosed in advance, and gives the parent an opportunity to challenge and refuse disclosure of the information in the records, before the program forwards the records to officials at a program, school, or school district in which the child seeks or intends to enroll or where the child is already enrolled so long as the disclosure is related to the child's enrollment or transfer.

        (c)  The procedures to protect PII must allow the program to disclose such PII from child records without parental consent to:

        (1) Officials within the program or acting for the program, such as contractors and subrecipients, if the official provides services for which the program would otherwise use employees, the program determines it is necessary for Head Start services, and the program maintains oversight with respect to the use, further disclosure, and maintenance of child records, such as through a written agreement;

        (2) Officials within the program, acting for the program, or from a federal or state entity, in connection with an audit or evaluation of education or child development programs, or for enforcement of or compliance with federal legal requirements of the program; provided the program maintains oversight with respect to the use, further disclosure, and maintenance of child records, such as through a written agreement, including the destruction of the PII when no longer needed for the purpose of the disclosure, except when the disclosure is specifically authorized by federal law or by the responsible HHS official;

        (3) Officials within the program, acting for the program, or from a federal or state entity, to conduct a study to improve child and family outcomes, including improving the quality of programs, for, or on behalf of, the program, provided the program maintains oversight with respect to the use, further disclosure, and maintenance of child records, such as through a written agreement, including the destruction of the PII when no longer needed for the purpose of the disclosure;

        (4) Appropriate parties in order to address a disaster, health or safety emergency during the period of the emergency, or a serious health and safety risk such as a serious food allergy, if the program determines that disclosing the PII from child records is necessary to protect the health or safety of children or other persons;

        (5) Comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, provided the program makes a reasonable effort to notify the parent about all such subpoenas and court orders in advance of the compliance therewith, unless:

        (i) A court has ordered that neither the subpoena, its contents, nor the information provided in response be disclosed;

        (ii) The disclosure is in compliance with an ex parte court order obtained by the United States Attorney General (or designee not lower than an Assistant Attorney General) concerning investigations or prosecutions of an offense listed in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B) or an act of domestic or international terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331.

        (iii) A parent is a party to a court proceeding directly involving child abuse and neglect (as defined in section 3 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101)) or dependency matters, and the order is issued in the context of that proceeding, additional notice to the parent by the program is not required; or,

        (iv) A program initiates legal action against a parent or a parent initiates legal action against a program, then a program may disclose to the court, also without a court order or subpoena, the child records relevant for the program to act as plaintiff or defendant.

        (6) The Secretary of Agriculture or an authorized representative from the Food and Nutrition Service to conduct program monitoring, evaluations, and performance measurements for the Child and Adult Care Food Program under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, if the results will be reported in an aggregate form that does not identify any individual: Provided, that any data collected must be protected in a manner that will not permit the personal identification of students and their parents by other than the authorized representatives of the Secretary of Agriculture and any PII must be destroyed when the data are no longer needed for program monitoring, evaluations, and performance measurements;

        (7) A caseworker or other representative from a state, local, or tribal child welfare agency, who has the right to access a case plan for a child who is in foster care placement, when such agency is legally responsible for the child's care and protection, under state or tribal law, if the agency agrees in writing to protect PII, to use information from the child's case plan for specific purposes intended of addressing the child's needs, and to destroy information that is no longer needed for those purposes; and,

        (8) Appropriate parties in order to address suspected or known child maltreatment and is consistent with applicable federal, state, local, and tribal laws on reporting child abuse and neglect.

        (d)  When a program establishes a written agreement with a third party, the procedures to protect such PII must require the program to annually review and, if necessary, update the agreement. If the third party violates the agreement, then the program may:

        (1) Provide the third party an opportunity to self-correct; or,

        (2) Prohibit the third party from access to records for a set period of time as established by the programs governing body and policy council.

        (e)  The procedures to protect PII must require the program to annually notify parents of their rights in writing described in this subpart and applicable definitions in part 1305 of this chapter, and include in that notice a description of the types of PII that may be disclosed, to whom the PII may be disclosed, and what may constitute a necessary reason for the disclosure without parental consent as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (f)  A program must only disclose the information that is deemed necessary for the purpose of the disclosure.

        (a)  (1) A parent has the right to inspect child records.

        (2) If the parent requests to inspect child records, the program must make the child records available within a reasonable time, but no more than 45 days after receipt of request.

        (3) If a program maintains child records that contain information on more than one child, the program must ensure the parent only inspects information that pertains to the parent's child.

        (4) The program shall not destroy a child record with an outstanding request to inspect and review the record under this section.

        (b)  (1) A parent has the right to ask the program to amend information in the child record that the parent believes is inaccurate, misleading, or violates the child's privacy.

        (2) The program must consider the parent's request and, if the request is denied, render a written decision to the parent within a reasonable time that informs the parent of the right to a hearing.

        (c)  (1) If the parent requests a hearing to challenge information in the child record, the program must schedule a hearing within a reasonable time, notify the parent, in advance, about the hearing, and ensure the person who conducts the hearing does not have a direct interest in its outcome.

        (2) The program must ensure the hearing affords the parent a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues.

        (3) If the program determines from evidence presented at the hearing that the information in the child records is inaccurate, misleading, or violates the child's privacy, the program must either amend or remove the information and notify the parent in writing.

        (4) If the program determines from evidence presented at the hearing that information in the child records is accurate, does not mislead, or otherwise does not violate the child's privacy, the program must inform the parent of the right to place a statement in the child records that either comments on the contested information or that states why the parent disagrees with the program's decision, or both.

        (d)  The program must provide a parent, free of charge, an initial copy of child records disclosed to third parties with parental consent and, upon parent request, an initial copy of child records disclosed to third parties, unless the disclosure was for a court that ordered neither the subpoena, its contents, nor the information furnished in response be disclosed.

        (b) The grant recipient's  decision to terminate must not be arbitrary or capricious.

        (c) The grant recipient must establish a process for defunding a delegate agency, including an appeal of a defunding decision and must ensure the process is fair and timely.

        (d) The grant recipient must notify the responsible HHS official about the appeal and its decision.

      Subpart E—Facilities

        § 1303.40   Purpose.

#### § § 1303.40

        This subpart prescribes what a grant recipient must establish to show it is eligible to purchase, construct and renovate facilities as outlined in section 644(c), (f) and (g) of the Act. It explains how a grant recipient may apply for funds, details what measures a grant recipient must take to protect federal interest in facilities purchased, constructed or renovated with grant funds, and concludes with other administrative provisions. This subpart applies to major renovations. It only applies to minor renovations and repairs, when they are included with a purchase application and are part of purchase costs.

        § 1303.41   Approval of previously purchased facilities.

#### § § 1303.41

        If a grant recipient purchased a facility after December 31, 1986, and seeks to use grant funds to continue to pay purchase costs for the facility or to refinance current indebtedness and use grant funds to service the resulting debt, the grant recipient may apply for funds to meet those costs. The grant recipient must submit an application that conforms to requirements in this part and in the Act to the responsible HHS official. If the responsible HHS official approves the grant recipient's  application, Head Start funds may be used to pay ongoing purchase costs, which include principal and interest on approved loans.

        § 1303.42   Eligibility to purchase, construct, and renovate facilities.

#### § § 1303.42

        Before a grant recipient can apply for funds to purchase, construct, or renovate a facility under § 1303.44, it must establish that:

        (a) The facility will be available to Indian Tribes, or rural or other low-income communities;

        (b) The proposed purchase, construction, or major renovation is within the grant recipient's designated service area;

        (c) The proposed purchase, construction, or major renovation is necessary because the lack of suitable facilities in the grant recipient's service area will inhibit the operation of the program; and

        (d) The proposed construction of a facility is more cost-effective than the purchase of available facilities or renovation.

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 61412, Sept. 6, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Monitoring, Suspension, Termination, Denial of Refunding, Reduction in Funding, and Their Appeals

        § 1304.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1304.1

        (a) Section 641A(c) of the Act requires the Secretary to monitor whether a grant recipient meets program governance, program operations, and financial and administrative standards described in this regulation and to identify areas for improvements and areas of strength as part of the grant recipient's ongoing self-assessment process. This subpart focuses on the monitoring process. It discusses areas of noncompliance, deficiencies, and corrective action through quality improvement plans.

        (b) Section 646(a) of the Act requires the Secretary to prescribe procedures for notice and appeal for certain adverse actions. This subpart establishes rules and procedures to suspend financial assistance to a grant recipient, deny a grant recipient's application for refunding, terminate, or reduce a grant recipient's assistance under the Act when the grant recipient improperly uses federal funds or fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, instructions, assurances, terms and conditions or, if the grant recipient loses its legal status or financial viability. This subpart does not apply to reductions to a grant recipient's financial assistance based on chronic under-enrollment procedures at section 641A(h) of the Act or to matters described in subpart B. This subpart does not apply to any administrative action based upon any violation, or alleged violation, of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Except as otherwise provided for in this subpart, the appeals and processes in this subpart will be governed by the Departmental Appeals Board regulations at 45 CFR part 16.

        § 1304.2   Monitoring.

#### § § 1304.2

        (a) If a responsible HHS official determines through monitoring, pursuant to section 641(A)(c)(1) and (2) of the Act, that a grant recipient fails to comply with any of the standards described in parts 1301, 1302, and 1303 of this chapter, the official will notify the grant recipient promptly in writing, identify the area of noncompliance, and specify when the grant recipient must correct the area of noncompliance.

        (b)  If the Secretary determines that a grant recipient meets one of the criteria for a deficiency, as defined in section 637(2)(C) of the Act, the Secretary shall inform the grant recipient of the deficiency. The grant recipient must correct the deficiency pursuant to section 641A(e)(1)(B) of the Act, as the responsible HHS official determines.

        (c)  If the responsible HHS official does not require the grant recipient to correct a deficiency immediately as prescribed under section 641A(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, the grant recipient must submit to the official, for approval, a quality improvement plan that adheres to section 641A(e)(2)(A) of the Act.

        § 1304.3   Suspension with notice.

#### § § 1304.3

        (a)  If a grant recipient breaches or threatens to breach any requirement stated in §§ 1304.3 through 1304.5, the responsible HHS official may suspend the grant recipient's financial assistance, in whole or in part, after it has given the grant recipient notice and an opportunity to show cause why assistance should not be suspended.

        (b)  (1) The responsible HHS official must notify the grant recipient in writing that ACF intends to suspend financial assistance, in whole or in part. The notice must:

        (i) Specify grounds for the suspension;

        (ii) Include the date suspension will become effective;

        (iii) Inform the grant recipient that it has the opportunity to submit to the responsible HHS official, at least seven days before suspension becomes effective, any written material it would like the official to consider, and to inform the grant recipient that it may request, in writing, no later than seven days after the suspension notice was mailed, to have an informal meeting with the responsible HHS official;

        (iv) Invite the grant recipient to voluntarily correct the deficiency; and,

        (v) Include a copy of this subpart.

        (2) The responsible HHS official must promptly transmit the suspension notice to the grant recipient. The notice becomes effective when the grant recipient receives the notice, when the grant recipient refuses delivery, or when the suspension notice is returned to sender unclaimed.

        (3) The responsible HHS official must send a copy of the suspension notice to any delegate agency whose actions or whose failures to act substantially caused or contributed to the proposed suspension. The responsible HHS official will inform the delegate agency that it is entitled to submit written material to oppose the suspension and to participate in the informal meeting, if one is held. In addition, the responsible HHS official may give notice to the grant recipient's other delegate agencies.

        (4) After the grant recipient receives the suspension notice, it has three days to send a copy of the notice to delegate agencies that would be financially affected by a suspension.

        (c)  The grant recipient may submit to the responsible HHS official any written material to show why financial assistance should not be suspended. The grant recipient may also request, in writing, to have an informal meeting with the responsible HHS official. If the grant recipient requests an informal meeting, the responsible HHS official must schedule the meeting within seven days after the grant recipient receives the suspension notice.

        (d)  If the responsible HHS official extends the time or the date by which a grant recipient has to make requests or to submit material, it must notify the grant recipient in writing.

        (e)  (1) The responsible HHS official will consider any written material presented before or during the informal meeting, as well as any proof the grant recipient has adequately corrected what led to suspension, and will render a decision within five days after the informal meeting. If no informal meeting is held, the responsible HHS official will render a decision within five days after it receives written material from all concerned parties.

        (2) If the responsible HHS official finds the grant recipient failed to show cause why ACF should not suspend financial assistance, the official may suspend financial assistance, in whole or in part, and under terms and conditions as he or she deems appropriate.

        (3) A suspension must not exceed 30 days, unless the conditions under section 646(a)(5)(B) are applicable or the grant recipient requests the suspension continue for an additional period of time and the responsible HHS official agrees.

        (4) The responsible HHS official may appoint an agency to serve as an interim grant recipient to operate the program until the grant recipient's suspension is lifted, or as otherwise provided under section 646(a)(5)(B) of the Act.

        (f)  New obligations the grant recipient incurs while under suspension are not allowed unless the responsible HHS official expressly authorizes them in the suspension notice or in an amendment to the suspension notice. Necessary and otherwise allowable costs which the grant recipient could not reasonably avoid during the suspension period will be allowed if they result from obligations the grant recipient properly incurred before suspension and not in anticipation of suspension or termination. The responsible HHS official may allow third-party in-kind contributions applicable to the suspension period to satisfy cost sharing or matching requirements.

        (g)  The responsible HHS official may modify or rescind suspension at any time, if the grant recipient can satisfactorily show that it has adequately corrected what led to suspension and that it will not repeat such actions or inactions. Nothing in this section precludes the HHS official from imposing suspension again for additional 30 day periods if the cause of the suspension has not been corrected.

        § 1304.4   Emergency suspension without advance notice.

#### § § 1304.4

        (a)  The responsible HHS official may suspend financial assistance, in whole or in part, without prior notice and an opportunity to show cause if there is an emergency situation, such as a serious risk for substantial injury to property or loss of project funds, a federal, state, or local criminal statute violation, or harm to staff or participants' health and safety.

        (b)  (1) The emergency suspension notification must:

        (i) Specify the grounds for the suspension;

        (ii) Include terms and conditions of any full or partial suspension;

        (iii) Inform that grant recipient it cannot make or incur any new expenditures or obligations under suspended portion of the program; and,

        (iv) Advise that within five days after the emergency suspension becomes effective, the grant recipient may request, in writing, an informal meeting with the responsible HHS official to show why the basis for the suspension was not valid and should be rescinded and that the grant recipient has corrected any deficiencies.

        (2) The responsible HHS official must promptly transmit the emergency suspension notification to the grant recipient that shows the date of receipt. The emergency suspension becomes effective upon delivery of the notification or upon the date the grant recipient refuses delivery, or upon return of the notification unclaimed.

        (3) Within two workdays after the grant recipient receives the emergency suspension notification, the grant recipient must send a copy of the notice to delegate agencies affected by the suspension.

        (4) The responsible HHS official must inform affected delegate agencies that they have the right to participate in the informal meeting.

        (c)  If the grant recipient requests an informal meeting, the responsible HHS official must schedule a meeting within five workdays after it receives the grant recipient's request. The suspension will continue until the grant recipient has been afforded such opportunity and until the responsible HHS official renders a decision. Notwithstanding provisions in this section, the responsible HHS official may proceed to deny refunding or to initiate termination proceedings at any time even though the grant recipient's financial assistance has been suspended in whole or in part.

        (d)  (1) The responsible HHS official will consider any written material presented before or during the informal meeting, as well as any proof the grant recipient has adequately corrected what led to suspension, and render a decision within five work days after the informal meeting.

        (2) If the responsible HHS official finds the grant recipient failed to show cause why suspension should be rescinded, the responsible HHS official may continue the suspension, in whole or in part, and under the terms and conditions specified in the emergency suspension notification.

        (3) A suspension must not exceed 30 days, unless the conditions under section 646(a)(5)(B) are applicable or the grant recipient requests the suspension to continue for an additional period of time and the responsible HHS official agrees.

        (4) The responsible HHS official may appoint an agency to serve as an interim grant recipient to operate the program until either the grant recipient's emergency suspension is lifted or a new grant recipient is selected.

        (e)  Any new obligations the grant recipient incurs during the suspension period will not be allowed unless the responsible HHS official expressly authorizes them in the suspension notice or in an amendment to the suspension notice. Necessary and otherwise allowable costs which the grant recipient could not reasonably avoid during the suspension period will be allowed if those costs result from obligations properly incurred before suspension and not in anticipation of suspension, denial of refunding or termination. The responsible HHS official may allow third-party in-kind contributions applicable to the suspension period to satisfy cost sharing or matching requirements.

        (f)  The responsible HHS official may modify or rescind suspension at any time, if the grant recipient can satisfactorily show that is has adequately corrected what led to the suspension and that it will not repeat such actions or inactions. Nothing in this section precludes the HHS official from imposing suspension again for additional 30 day periods if the cause of the suspension has not been corrected.

        § 1304.5   Termination and denial of refunding.

#### § § 1304.5

        (a)  (1) A responsible HHS official may terminate financial assistance in whole or in part to a grant recipient or deny a grant recipient's application for refunding.

        (i) Include the legal basis for termination or adverse action as described in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (ii) Include factual findings on which the action is based or reference specific findings in another document that form the basis for termination or denial of refunding;

        (iii) Cite to any statutory provisions, regulations, or policy issuances on which ACF relies for its determination;

        (iv) Inform the grant recipient that it may appeal the denial or termination within 30 days to the Departmental Appeals Board, that the appeal will be governed by 45 CFR part 16, except as otherwise provided in the Head Start appeals regulations, that a copy of the appeal must sent to the responsible HHS official, and that it has the right to request and receive a hearing, as mandated under section 646 of the Act;

        (2) The responsible HHS official must provide the grant recipient as much notice as possible, but must notify the grant recipient no later than 30 days after ACF receives the annual application for refunding, that it has the opportunity for a full and fair hearing on whether refunding should be denied.

        (c)  (1) The grant recipient must adhere to procedures and requirements for appeals in 45 CFR part 16, file the appeal with the Departmental Appeals Board, and serve a copy of the appeal on the responsible HHS official who issued the termination or denial of refunding notice. The grant recipients must also serve a copy of its appeal on any affected delegate.

        (2) Unless funding has been suspended, funding will continue while a grant recipient appeals a termination decision, unless the responsible HHS official renders an adverse decision, or unless the current budget period is expired.

The Designation Renewal System is established in this part to determine whether Head Start agencies deliver high-quality services to meet the educational, health, nutritional, and social needs of the children and families they serve; meet the program and financial requirements and standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Head Start Act; and qualify to be designated for funding for five years without competing for such funding as required under section 641(c) or 645A(b)(12) and (d) of the Head Start Act. A competition to select a new Head Start agency to replace a Head Start agency that has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily is not part of the Designation Renewal System established in this part, and is subject instead to the requirements of § 1304.20.

        § 1304.11   Basis for determining whether a Head Start agency will be subject to an open competition.

#### § § 1304.11

        A Head Start agency will be required to compete for its next five years of funding whenever the responsible HHS official determines that one or more of the following seven conditions existed during the relevant time period under § 1304.15:

        (a) An agency has two or more deficiencies across reviews conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act during the relevant time period under § 1304.15.

        (b) An agency has not, based on a review conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act during the relevant time period under § 1304.15:

        (1) Established program goals for improving the school readiness of children participating in its program in accordance with the requirements of section 641A(g)(2) of the Act and demonstrated that such goals:

        (i) Appropriately reflect the ages of children, birth to five, participating in the program;

        (ii) Align with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework: Ages Birth to Five, state early learning guidelines, and the requirements and expectations of the schools, to the extent that they apply to the ages of children, birth to five, participating in the program and at a minimum address the domains of language and literacy development, cognition and general knowledge, approaches toward learning, physical well-being and motor development, and social and emotional development;

        (iii) Were established in consultation with the parents of children participating in the program.

        (2) Taken steps to achieve the school readiness goals described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrated by:

        (i) Aggregating and analyzing aggregate child-level assessment data at least three times per year (except for programs operating less than 90 days, which will be required to do so at least twice within their operating program period) and using that data in combination with other program data to determine grant recipients' progress toward meeting its goals, to inform parents and the community of results, and to direct continuous improvement related to curriculum, instruction, professional development, program design and other program decisions; and

        (ii) Analyzing individual ongoing, child-level assessment data for all children birth to age five participating in the program and using that data in combination with input from parents and families to determine each child's status and progress with regard to, at a minimum, language and literacy development, cognition and general knowledge, approaches toward learning, physical well-being and motor development, and social and emotional development, and to individualize the experiences, instructional strategies, and services to best support each child.

        (c) An agency has been determined during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under § 1304.15:

        (1) To have an average score across all classrooms observed that is below the following competitive thresholds on any of the three CLASS: Pre-K domains from the most recent CLASS: Pre-K observation:

        (i) For the Emotional Support domain, the competitive threshold is 5;

        (ii) For the Classroom Organization domain, the competitive threshold is 5;

        (iii) For the Instructional Support domain, the competitive threshold is 2.3 through July 31, 2027, and 2.5 on and after August 1, 2027.

        (2) If an agency is determined to have an average score across all classrooms observed below the quality threshold on any of the three CLASS: Pre-K domains, the Office of Head Start will support the program to strengthen its coordinated approach to training and professional development as required in § 1302.92(b) and (c), to help promote improvement in teaching practices and teacher-child interactions. The quality threshold for each domain is as follows:

        (i) For the Emotional Support domain, the quality threshold is 6;

        (ii) For the Classroom Organization domain, the quality threshold is 6;

        (iii) For the Instructional Support domain, the quality threshold is 3.

        (d) An agency has had a revocation of its license to operate a Head Start center or program by a State or local licensing agency during the relevant time period under § 1304.15, and the revocation has not been overturned or withdrawn before a competition for funding for the next five-year period is announced. A pending challenge to the license revocation or restoration of the license after correction of the violation will not affect application of this requirement after the competition for funding for the next five-year period has been announced.

        (e) An agency has been suspended from the Head Start program by ACF during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under § 1304.15 and the suspension has not been overturned or withdrawn. If the agency did not have an opportunity to show cause as to why the suspension should not have been imposed or why the suspension should have been lifted if it had already been imposed under this part, the agency will not be required to compete based on this condition. If an agency has received an opportunity to show cause and the suspension remains in place, the condition will be implemented.

        (f) An agency has been debarred from receiving federal or state funds from any federal or state department or agency or has been disqualified from the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) any time during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under § 1304.15 but has not yet been terminated or denied refunding by ACF. (A debarred agency will only be eligible to compete for Head Start funding if it receives a waiver described in 2 CFR 180.135.)

        (g) An agency meets one of two fiscal criteria, if the agency:

        (1) Is at risk of failing to continue functioning as a going concern within the current project period. The final determination is made by the responsible HHS official based on a review of the findings and opinions of an audit conducted in accordance with section 647 of the Act; an audit, review or investigation by a state agency; a review by the National External Audit Review (NEAR) Center; or an audit, investigation or inspection by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General; or

        (2) Has a total of two or more audit findings of material weakness or questioned costs associated with its Head Start funds in audit reports submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (in accordance with section 647 of the Act) for a financial period within the current project period.

        § 1304.13   Requirements to be considered for designation for a five-year period when the existing grant recipient in a community is not determined to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program and is not automatically renewed.

#### § § 1304.13

        In order to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant, an agency must submit an application to the responsible HHS official that demonstrates that it is the most qualified entity to deliver a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program. The application must address the criteria for selection listed at section 641(d)(2) of the Head Start Act. Any agency that has had its Head Start grant terminated for cause in the preceding five years is excluded from competing in such competition for the next five years. A Head Start agency that has had a denial of refunding, as defined in 45 CFR part 1305, in the preceding five years is also excluded from competing.

        § 1304.14   Tribal government consultation under the Designation Renewal System for when an Indian Head Start grant is being considered for competition.

#### § § 1304.14

        (a) In the case of an Indian Head Start agency determined not to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program, the responsible HHS official will engage in government-to-government consultation with the appropriate Tribal government or governments for the purpose of establishing a plan to improve the quality of the Head Start program operated by the Indian Head Start agency.

        (1) The plan will be established and implemented within six months after the responsible HHS official's determination.

        (2) Not more than six months after the implementation of that plan, the responsible HHS official will reevaluate the performance of the Indian Head Start agency.

        (3) If the Indian Head Start agency is still not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program, the responsible HHS official will conduct an open competition to select a grant recipient to provide services for the community currently being served by the Indian Head Start agency.

        (b) A non-Indian Head Start agency will not be eligible to receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program, unless there is no Indian Head Start agency available for designation to carry out an Indian Head Start program.

        (c) A non-Indian Head Start agency may receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program only until such time as an Indian Head Start agency in such community becomes available and is designated pursuant to this part.

        § 1304.15   Designation request, review and notification process.

#### § § 1304.15

        (a) A grant recipient must apply to be considered for Designation Renewal. A Head Start agency wishing to be considered to have its designation as a Head Start agency renewed for another five-year period without competition must request that status from ACF at least 12 months before the end of their five-year grant period or by such time as required by the Secretary.

        (b) ACF will review the relevant data to determine if one or more of the conditions under § 1304.11 were met by the Head Start agency during the current project period.

        (c) ACF will give notice to grant recipients on Designation Renewal System status, except as provided in § 1304.14, at least 12 months before the expiration date of a Head Start agency's current grant, stating:

        (1) The Head Start agency will be required to compete for funding for an additional five-year period because ACF finds that one or more conditions under § 1304.11 were met by the agency's program during the relevant time period described in paragraph (b) of this section, identifying the conditions ACF found, and summarizing the basis for the finding; or

        (2) That such agency has been determined on a preliminary basis to be eligible for renewed funding for five years without competition because ACF finds that none of the conditions under § 1304.11 have been met during the relevant time period described in paragraph (b) of this section. If prior to the award of that grant, ACF determines that the grant recipient has met one of the conditions under § 1304.11 during the relevant time period described in paragraph (b) of this section, this determination will change and the grant recipient will receive notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that it will be required to compete for funding for an additional five-year period.

        § 1304.16   Use of CLASS: Pre-K instrument in the Designation Renewal System.

#### § § 1304.16

        Except when all children are served in a single classroom, ACF will conduct observations of multiple classes operated by the grant recipient based on a random sample of all classes and rate the conduct of the classes observed using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. When the grant recipient serves children in its program in a single class, that class will be observed and rated using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. The domain scores for that class will be the domain scores for the grant recipient for that observation. After the observations are completed, ACF will report to the grant recipient the scores of the classes observed during the CLASS: Pre-K observations in each of the domains covered by the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. ACF will average CLASS: Pre-K instrument scores in each domain for the classes operated by the agency that ACF observed to determine the agency's score in each domain.

        § 1304.17   Flexibility for Head Start Designation Renewal Determinations in Certain Emergencies.

#### § § 1304.17

        (a) In reviewing the relevant data as described in § 1304.15(b), if ACF determines that one or more data elements described in the conditions in section § 1304.11 is not available due to an emergency described in paragraph (b) of this section, ACF may make a designation renewal determination based on the data elements that are available.

        (b) The emergencies are:

        (1) A major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170).

        (2) An emergency declared by the President under section 501 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191).

        (3) A public health emergency declared by the Secretary pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d).

      Subpart D—Replacement of American Indian and Alaska Native Grant Recipients

        §1304.30    Procedure for indentification of alternative agency.

#### § §1304.30 

        (a) An Indian tribe whose Head Start grant has been terminated, relinquished, designated for competition or which has been denied refunding as a Head Start agency, may identify an alternate agency and request the responsible HHS official to designate such agency as an alternative agency to provide Head Start services to the tribe if:

        (1) The tribe was the only agency that was receiving federal financial assistance to provide Head Start services to members of the tribe; and,

        (2) The tribe would be otherwise precluded from providing such services to its members because of the termination or denial of refunding.

        (b)(1) The responsible HHS official, when notifying a tribal grant recipient of the intent to terminate financial assistance or deny its application for refunding, or its designation for competition must notify the grant recipient that it may identify an agency and request that the agency serve as the alternative agency in the event that the grant is terminated or refunding denied, or the grant is not renewed without competition.

        (2) The tribe must identify the alternate agency to the responsible HHS official in writing.

        (3) The responsible HHS official will notify the tribe, in writing, whether the alternative agency proposed by the tribe is found to be eligible for Head Start funding and capable of operating a Head Start program. If the alternative agency identified by the tribe is not an eligible agency capable of operating a Head Start program, the tribe will have 15 days from the date of the sending of the notification to that effect from the responsible HHS official to identify another agency and request that the agency be designated. The responsible HHS official will notify the tribe in writing whether the second proposed alternate agency is found to be an eligible agency capable of operating the Head Start program.

        (4) If the tribe does not identify an eligible, suitable alternative agency, a grant recipient will be designated under these regulations.

        (c) If the tribe appeals a termination of financial assistance or a denial of refunding, it will, consistent with the terms of § 1304.5, continue to be funded pending resolution of the appeal. However, the responsible HHS official and the grant recipient will proceed with the steps outlined in this regulation during the appeal process.

        (d) If the tribe does not identify an agency and request that the agency be appointed as the alternative agency, the responsible HHS official will seek a permanent replacement grant recipient under these regulations.

        § 1304.31   Requirements of alternative agency.

#### § § 1304.31

        The agency identified by the Indian tribe must establish that it meets all requirements established by the Head Start Act and these requirements for designation as a Head Start grant recipient and that it is capable of conducting a Head Start program. The responsible HHS official, in deciding whether to designate the proposed agency, will analyze the capacity and experience of the agency according to the criteria found in section 641(d) of the Head Start Act and § 1304.20.

        § 1304.32   Alternative agency—prohibition.

#### § § 1304.32

        (a) No agency will be designated as the alternative agency pursuant to this subpart if the agency includes an employee who:

        (1) Served on the administrative or program staff of the Indian tribal grant recipient described under section 646(e)(1)(A) of the Act; and

        (2) Was responsible for a deficiency that:

        (i) Relates to the performance standards or financial management standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Act; and,

        (ii) Was the basis for the termination of assistance under section 646(e)(1)(A) of the Act or denial of refunding described in § 1304.4.

        (b) The responsible HHS official shall determine whether an employee was responsible for a deficiency within the meaning and context of this section.

The CLASS assesses three domains of classroom experience: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support.

      (1) Emotional Support measures children's social and emotional functioning in the classroom, and includes four dimensions: Positive Climate, Negative Climate, Teacher Sensitivity and Regard for Student Perspectives. Positive Climate addresses the emotional connection, respect, and enjoyment demonstrated between teachers and children and among children. Negative Climate addresses the level of expressed negativity such as anger, hostility, or aggression exhibited by teachers and/or children in the classroom. Teacher Sensitivity addresses teachers' awareness of and responsivity to children's academic and emotional concerns. Regard for Student Perspectives addresses the degree to which teachers' interactions with children and classroom activities place an emphasis on children's interests, motivations, and points of view.

      (2) Classroom Organization measures a broad array of classroom processes related to the organization and management of children's behavior, time, and attention in the classroom. It includes three dimensions: Behavior Management, Productivity, and Instructional Learning Formats. Behavior Management addresses how effectively teachers monitor, prevent, and redirect behavior. Productivity addresses how well the classroom runs with respect to routines and the degree to which teachers organize activities and directions so that maximum time can be spent on learning activities. Instructional Learning Formats addresses how teachers facilitate activities and provide interesting materials so that children are engaged and learning opportunities are maximized.

      (3) Instructional Support measures the ways in which teachers implement curriculum to effectively support cognitive and language development. It includes three dimensions: Concept Development, Quality of Feedback, and Language Modeling. Concept Development addresses how teachers use instructional discussions and activities to promote children's higher order thinking skills in contrast to a focus on rote instruction. Quality of Feedback addresses how teachers extend children's learning through their responses to children's ideas, comments, and work. Language Modeling addresses the extent to which teachers facilitate and encourage children's language.

      (4) Assessments with the CLASS involve observation-based measurement of each dimension on a seven point scale. A score ranging from 1 (minimally characteristic) to 7 (highly characteristic) is given for each dimension and represents the extent to which that dimension is characteristic of that classroom. Relevant dimension scores are used to calculate each domain score.

      means new buildings, and excludes renovations, alterations, additions, or work of any kind to existing buildings.

      means Head Start services provided to children in a manner that promotes primary caregiving and minimizes the number of transitions in teachers and teacher assistants that children experience over the course of the day, week, program year, and to the extent possible, during the course of their participation from birth to age three in Early Head Start and in Head Start Preschool.

      is defined in the same manner as presented in the Head Start Act, 42 U.S.C. 9801.

      means the refusal of a funding agency to fund an application for a continuation of a Head Start program for a subsequent program year when the decision is based on a determination that the grant recipient has improperly conducted its program, or is incapable of doing so properly in the future, or otherwise is in violation of applicable law, regulations, or other policies.

      mean costs incurred in accordance with an approved Head Start budget which do not directly relate to the provision of program component services, including services to children with disabilities, as set forth and described in the Head Start program performance standards (45 CFR part 1304).

      means to permit access to or the release, transfer, or other communication of PII contained in child records by any means, including oral, written, or electronic means, to any party except the party identified as the party that provided or created the record.

      means a center-based option that employs a single teacher to work with one group of children in the morning and a different group of children in the afternoon.

      mean costs incurred in accordance with an approved Head Start budget which directly relate to both development and administrative functions and to the program component services, including services to children with disabilities, as set forth and described in the Head Start program performance standards (45 CFR part 1304).

      means a child who is acquiring two or more languages at the same time, or a child who is learning a second language while continuing to develop their first language. The term “dual language learner” may encompass or overlap substantially with other terms frequently used, such as bilingual, English language learner (ELL), Limited English Proficient (LEP), English learner, and children who speak a Language Other Than English (LOTE).

      means a program that serves pregnant women and children from birth to age three, pursuant to section 645A(e) of the Head Start Act. This includes Tribal and migrant or seasonal programs.

      means a child has been accepted and attended at least one class for center-based or family child care option or at least one home visit for the home-based option.

        (b) In States with multiple planning and service areas, the State agency shall designate area agencies on aging to assist in carrying out the mission described above for the State agency at the sub-State level. The State agency shall designate as area agencies on aging only those non-State agencies having the capacity and making the commitment to fully carry out the mission described for area agencies in § 1321.55.

        (c) The State agency shall assure that the resources made available to area agencies on aging under the Act are used to carry out the mission described for area agencies in § 1321.55.

The P&A may elect to obtain a release regarding personal information and privacy from all individuals requesting or receiving services at the time of intake or application. The release shall state that only information directly related to client and case eligibility will be subject to disclosure to officials of the Department.

        The term “American Indian Consortium” means any confederation of 2 or more recognized American Indian Tribes, created through the official resident population of 150,000 enrolled tribal members and a contiguous territory of Indian lands in two or more States.

        The term “designating official” means the Governor or other State official, who is empowered by the State legislature or Governor to designate the State official or public or private agency to be accountable for the proper use of funds by and conduct of the agency designated to administer the P&A system.

        The term “full investigation” means access to service providers, individuals with developmental disabilities and records authorized under these regulations, that are necessary for a P&A system to make a determination about whether alleged or suspected instances of abuse and neglect are taking place or have taken place. Full investigations may be conducted independently or in cooperation with other agencies authorized to conduct similar investigations.

        The terms “legal guardian,” “conservator,” and “legal representative” all mean a parent of a minor, unless the State has appointed another legal guardian under applicable State law, or an individual appointed and regularly reviewed by a State court or agency empowered under State law to appoint and review such officers, and having authority to make all decisions on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities.

The individual making such determination may base the decision on reasonable inferences drawn from his or her experience or training regarding similar incidents, conditions or problems that are usually associated with abuse or neglect.

        The term “State Protection and Advocacy System” is synonymous with the term “P&A” used elsewhere in this regulation, and the terms “System” and “Protection and Advocacy System” used in this part and in subpart C of this part.

        § 1326.21   Requirements and authority of the State Protection and Advocacy System.

#### § § 1326.21

        (a) In order for a State to receive Federal funding for Protection and Advocacy activities under this subpart, as well as for the State Council on Developmental Disabilities activities (subpart D of this part), the Protection and Advocacy System must meet the requirements of section 143 and 144 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15043 and 15044) and that system must be operational.

        (b) Allotments must be used to supplement and not to supplant the level of non-Federal funds available in the State for activities under the Act, which shall include activities on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities to remedy abuse, neglect, and violations of rights as well as information and referral activities.

        (c) A P&A shall not implement a policy or practice restricting the remedies that may be sought on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities or compromising the authority of the P&A to pursue such remedies through litigation, legal action or other forms of advocacy. Under this requirement, States may not establish a policy or practice, which requires the P&A to: Obtain the State's review or approval of the P&A's plans to undertake a particular advocacy initiative, including specific litigation (or to pursue litigation rather than some other remedy or approach); refrain from representing individuals with particular types of concerns or legal claims, or refrain from otherwise pursuing a particular course of action designed to remedy a violation of rights, such as educating policymakers about the need for modification or adoption of laws or policies affecting the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities; restrict the manner of the P&A's investigation in a way that is inconsistent with the System's required authority under the DD Act; or similarly interfere with the P&A's exercise of such authority. The requirements of this paragraph (c) shall not prevent P&As, including those functioning as agencies within State governments, from developing case or client acceptance criteria as part of the annual priorities identified by the P&A as described in § 1326.23(c). Clients must be informed at the time they apply for services of such criteria.

        (d) A Protection and Advocacy System shall be free from hiring freezes, reductions in force, prohibitions on staff travel, or other policies, imposed by the State, to the extent that such policies would impact system program staff or functions funded with Federal funds, and would prevent the system from carrying out its mandates under the Act.

        (e) A Protection and Advocacy System shall have sufficient staff, qualified by training and experience, to carry out the responsibilities of the system in accordance with the priorities of the system and requirements of the Act. These responsibilities include the investigation of allegations of abuse, neglect and representations of individuals with developmental disabilities regarding rights violations.

        (f) A Protection and Advocacy System may exercise its authority under State law where the State authority exceeds the authority required by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000. However, State law must not diminish the required authority of the Protection and Advocacy System as set by the Act.

        (g) Each Protection and Advocacy System that is a public system without a multimember governing or advisory board must establish an advisory council in order to provide a voice for individuals with developmental disabilities. The Advisory Council shall advise the Protection and Advocacy System on program policies and priorities. The Advisory Council and Governing Board shall be comprised of a majority of individuals with disabilities who are eligible for services, have received or are receiving services, parents, family members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives of such individuals.

        (h) Prior to any Federal review of the State program, a 30-day notice and an opportunity for public comment must be published in the  Reasonable effort shall be made by AIDD to seek comments through notification to major disability advocacy groups, the State Bar, disability law resources, the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, and the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, for example, through newsletters and publication of those organizations. The findings of public comments may be consolidated if sufficiently similar issues are raised and they shall be included in the report of the onsite visit.

        (i) Before the Protection and Advocacy System releases information to individuals not otherwise authorized to receive it, the Protection and Advocacy System must obtain written consent from the client requesting assistance or his or her guardian.

        (j)  (1) An eligible P&A system may contract for the operation of part of its program with another public or private nonprofit organization with demonstrated experience working with individuals with developmental disabilities, provided that:

        (i) The eligible P&A system institutes oversight and monitoring procedures which ensure that any and all subcontractors will be able to meet all applicable terms, conditions and obligations of the Federal grant, including but not limited to the ability to pursue all forms of litigation under the DD Act;

        (ii) The P&A exercises appropriate oversight to ensure that the contracting organization meets all applicable responsibilities and standards which apply to P&As, including but not limited to, the confidentiality provisions in the DD Act and regulations, ethical responsibilities, program accountability and quality controls;

        (2) Any eligible P&A system should work cooperatively with existing advocacy agencies and groups and, where appropriate, consider entering into contracts for protection and advocacy services with organizations already working on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities.

In order to be accepted, the Report must meet the requirements of section 144(e) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15044), the applicable regulation and include information on the System's program necessary for the Secretary, or his or her designee, to comply with section 105(1), (2), and (3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15005). The Report shall describe the activities, accomplishments, and expenditures of the system during the preceding fiscal year. Reports shall include a description of the system's goals and the extent to which the goals were achieved, barriers to their achievement; the process used to obtain public input, the nature of such input, and how such input was used; the extent to which unserved or underserved individuals or groups, particularly from ethnic or racial groups or geographic regions ( rural or urban areas) were the target of assistance or service; and other such information on the Protection and Advocacy System's activities requested by AIDD.

        (b) Financial status reports (standard form 425) must be submitted by the agency administering and operating the State Protection and Advocacy System semiannually.

        (c) By January 1 of each year, the State Protection and Advocacy System shall submit to AIDD, an Annual Statement of Goals and Priorities, (SGP), for the coming fiscal year as required under section 143(a)(2)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15043). In order to be accepted by AIDD, an SGP must meet the requirements of section 143 of the Act.

        (1) The SGP is a description and explanation of the system's goals and priorities for its activities, selection criteria for its individual advocacy and training activities, and the outcomes it strives to accomplish. The SGP is developed through data driven strategic planning. If changes are made to the goals or the indicators of progress established for a year, the SGP must be amended to reflect those changes. The SGP must include a description of how the Protection and Advocacy System operates, and where applicable, how it coordinates the State Protection and Advocacy program for individuals with developmental disabilities with other Protection and Advocacy programs administered by the State Protection and Advocacy System. This description must include the System's processes for intake, internal and external referrals, and streamlining of advocacy services. If the System will be requesting or requiring fees or donations from clients as part of the intake process, the SGP must state that the system will be doing so. The description also must address collaboration, the reduction of duplication and overlap of services, the sharing of information on service needs, and the development of statements of goals and priorities for the various advocacy programs.

        (2) Priorities as established through the SGP serve as the basis for the Protection and Advocacy System to determine which cases are selected in a given fiscal year. Protection and Advocacy Systems have the authority to turn down a request for assistance when it is outside the scope of the SGP, but they must inform individuals when this is the basis for turning them down.

        (d) Each fiscal year, the Protection and Advocacy System shall:

        (1) Obtain formal public input on its Statement of Goals and Priorities;

        (2) At a minimum, provide for a broad distribution of the proposed Statement of Goals and Priorities for the next fiscal year in a manner accessible to individuals with developmental disabilities and their representatives, allowing at least 45 days from the date of distribution for comment;

        (3) Provide to the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities and the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service a copy of the proposed Statement of Goals and Priorities for comment concurrently with the public notice;

        (4) Incorporate or address any comments received through public input and any input received from the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities and the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service in the final Statement submitted; and

        (5) Address how the Protection and Advocacy System, State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, and University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education Research and Service will collaborate with each other and with other public and private entities.

        § 1326.23   Non-allowable costs for the State Protection and Advocacy System.

#### § § 1326.23

        (a) Federal financial participation is not allowable for:

        (1) Costs incurred for activities on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities to solve problems not directly related to their disabilities and which are faced by the general populace. Such activities include but are not limited to: Preparation of wills, divorce decrees, and real estate proceedings. Allowable costs in such cases would include the Protection and Advocacy System providing disability-related technical assistance information and referral to appropriate programs and services; and

        (2) Costs not allowed under other applicable statutes, Departmental regulations and issuances of the Office of Management and Budget.

        (b) Attorneys' fees are considered program income pursuant to 45 CFR part 75 and must be added to the funds committed to the program and used to further the objectives of the program. This requirement shall apply to all attorneys' fees, including those earned by contractors and those received after the project period in which they were earned.

        § 1326.24   Allowable litigation costs.

#### § § 1326.24

        Allotments may be used to pay the otherwise allowable costs incurred by a Protection and Advocacy System in bringing lawsuits in its own right to redress incidents of abuse or neglect, discrimination and other rights violations impacting the ability of individuals with developmental disabilities to obtain access to records and when it appears on behalf of named plaintiffs or a class of plaintiff for such purposes.

      Subpart C—Access to Records, Service Providers, and Individuals With Developmental Disabilities

        § 1326.25   Access to records.

#### § § 1326.25

        (a) Pursuant to sections 143(a)(2), (A)(i), (B), (I), and (J) of the Act, and subject to the provisions of this section, a Protection and Advocacy (P&A) System, and all of its authorized agents, shall have access to the records of individuals with developmental disabilities under the following circumstances:

        (1) If authorized by an individual who is a client of the system, or who has requested assistance from the system, or by such individual's legal guardian, conservator or other legal representative.

        (2) In the case of an individual to whom all of the following conditions apply:

        (i) The individual, due to his or her mental or physical condition, is unable to authorize the system to have access;

        (ii) The individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator or other legal representative, or the individual's guardian is the State (or one of its political subdivisions); and

        (iii) The individual has been the subject of a complaint to the P&A system, or the P&A system has probable cause (which can be the result of monitoring or other activities including media reports and newspaper articles) to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse and neglect.

        (3) In the case of an individual, who has a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative, about whom a complaint has been received by the system or, as a result of monitoring or other activities, the system has determined that there is probable cause to believe that the individual with developmental disability has been subject to abuse or neglect, whenever the following conditions exist:

        (i) The P&A system has made a good faith effort to contact the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative upon prompt receipt (within the timelines set forth in paragraph (c) of this section) of the contact information (which is required to include but not limited to name, address, telephone numbers, and email address) of the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative;

        (ii) The system has offered assistance to the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative to resolve the situation; and

        (iii) The legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative has failed or refused to provide consent on behalf of the individual.

        (4) If the P&A determines there is probable cause to believe that the health or safety of an individual is in serious and immediate jeopardy, no consent from another party is needed.

        (5) In the case of death, no consent from another party is needed. Probable cause to believe that the death of an individual with a developmental disability resulted from abuse or neglect or any other specific cause is not required for the P&A system to obtain access to the records. Any individual who dies in a situation in which services, supports, or other assistance are, have been, or may customarily be provided to individuals with developmental disabilities shall, for the purposes of the P&A system obtaining access to the individual's records, be deemed an “individual with a developmental disability.”

        (b) Individual records to which P&A systems must have access under section 143(a)(2), (A)(i), (B), (I), and (J) of the Act (whether written or in another medium, draft, preliminary or final, including handwritten notes, electronic files, photographs or video or audiotape records) shall include, but shall not be limited to:

        (1) Individual records prepared or received in the course of providing intake, assessment, evaluation, education, training and other services; supports or assistance, including medical records, financial records, and monitoring and other reports prepared or received by a service provider. This includes records stored or maintained at sites other than that of the service provider, as well as records that were not prepared by the service provider, but received by the service provider from other service providers.

        (2) Reports prepared by a Federal, State or local governmental agency, or a private organization charged with investigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death. The organizations whose reports are subject to this requirement include, but are not limited to, agencies in the foster care systems, developmental disabilities systems, prison and jail systems, public and private educational systems, emergency shelters, criminal and civil law enforcement agencies such as police departments, agencies overseeing juvenile justice facilities, juvenile detention facilities, all pre- and post-adjudication juvenile facilities, State and Federal licensing and certification agencies, and private accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations or by medical care evaluation or peer review committees, regardless of whether they are protected by federal or state law. The reports subject to this requirement describe any or all of the following:

        (i) The incidents of abuse, neglect, injury, and/or death;

        (ii) The steps taken to investigate the incidents;

        (iii) Reports and records, including personnel records, prepared or maintained by the service provider in connection with such reports of incidents; or,

        (iv) Supporting information that was relied upon in creating a report including all information and records that describe persons who were interviewed, physical and documentary evidence that was reviewed, and the related investigative findings;

        (3) Discharge planning records; and

        (4) Information in professional, performance, building or other safety standards, and demographic and statistical information relating to a service provider.

        (c) The time period in which the P&A system must be given access to records of individuals with developmental disabilities under sections 143(a)(2)(A)(i), (B), (I), and (J) of the Act, and subject to the provisions of this section, varies depending on the following circumstances:

        (1) If the P&A system determines that there is probable cause to believe that the health or safety of the individual with a developmental disability is in serious and immediate jeopardy, or in any case of the death of an individual with a developmental disability, access to the records of the individual with a developmental disability, as described in paragraph (b) of this section shall be provided (including the right to inspect and copy records as specified in paragraph (d) of this section) to the P&A system within 24 hours of receipt of the P&A system's written request for the records without the consent of another party.

        (2) In all other cases, access to records of individuals with developmental disabilities shall be provided to the P&A system within three business days after the receipt of such a written request from the P&A system.

        (d) A P&A shall be permitted to inspect and copy information and records, subject to a reasonable charge to offset duplicating costs. If the service provider or its agents copy the records for the P&A system, it may not charge the P&A system an amount that would exceed the amount customarily charged other non-profit or State government agencies for reproducing documents. At its option, the P&A may make written notes when inspecting information and records, and may use its own photocopying equipment to obtain copies. If a party other than the P&A system performs the photocopying or other reproduction of records, it shall provide the photocopies or reproductions to the P&A system within the time frames specified in paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, where records are kept or maintained electronically they shall be provided to the P&A electronically.

        (e) The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without the authorization of the individual to a P&A system to the extent that such disclosure is required by law and the disclosure complies with the requirements of that law.

        (f) Educational agencies, including public, private, and charter schools, as well as, public and private residential and non-residential schools, must provide a P&A with the name of and contact information for the parent or guardian of a student for whom the P&A has probable cause to obtain records under the DD Act.

        § 1326.26   Denial or delay of access to records.

#### § § 1326.26

        If a P&A system's access is denied or delayed beyond the deadlines specified in § 1326.25, the P&A system shall be provided, within one business day after the expiration of such deadline, with a written statement of reasons for the denial or delay. In the case of a denial for alleged lack of authorization, the name, address and telephone number of individuals with developmental disabilities and legal guardians, conservators, or other legal representative will be included in the aforementioned response. All of the above information shall be provided whether or not the P&A has probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect, or has received a complaint.

> [80 FR 44807, July 27, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 35647, June 3, 2016]

        § 1326.27   Access to service providers and individuals with developmental disabilities.

#### § § 1326.27

        (a) Access to service providers and individuals with developmental disabilities shall be extended to all authorized agents of a P&A system.

        (b) The P&A system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to individuals with developmental disabilities at all times necessary to conduct a full investigation of an incident of abuse or neglect.

        (1) Such access shall be afforded upon request, by the P&A system when:

        (i) An incident is reported or a complaint is made to the P&A system;

        (ii) The P&A system determines that there is probable cause to believe that an incident has or may have occurred; or

        (iii) The P&A system determines that there is or may be imminent danger of serious abuse or neglect of an individual with a developmental disability.

        (2) A P&A system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to public and private service providers, programs in the State, and to all areas of the service provider's premises that are used by individuals with developmental disabilities or are accessible to them. Such access shall be provided without advance notice and made available immediately upon request. This authority shall include the opportunity to interview any individual with developmental disability, employee, or other persons, including the person thought to be the victim of such abuse, who might be reasonably believed by the system to have knowledge of the incident under investigation. The P&A may not be required to provide the name or other identifying information regarding the individual with developmental disability or staff with whom it plans to meet; neither may the P&A be required to justify or explain its interaction with such persons.

        (c) In addition to the access required under paragraph (b) of this section, a P&A system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to service providers for routine circumstances. This includes areas which are used by individuals with developmental disabilities and are accessible to individuals with developmental disabilities at reasonable times, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours and visiting hours. A P&A also shall be permitted to attend treatment planning meetings concerning individuals with developmental disabilities with the consent of the individual or his or her guardian, conservator or other legal representative, except that no consent is required if the individual, due to his or mental or physical condition, is unable to authorize the system to have access to a treatment planning meeting; and the individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator or other legal representative, or the individual's guardian is the State (or one of its political subdivisions).

        (1) Access to service providers shall be afforded immediately upon an oral or written request by the P&A system. Except where complying with the P&A's request would interfere with treatment or therapy to be provided, service providers shall provide access to individuals for the purpose covered by this paragraph. If the P&As access to an individual must be delayed beyond 24 hours to allow for the provision of treatment or therapy, the P&A shall receive access as soon as possible thereafter. In cases where a service provider denies a P&A access to an individual with a developmental disability on the grounds that such access would interfere with the individual's treatment or therapy, the service provider shall, no later than 24 hours of the P&A's request, provide the P&A with a written statement from a physician stating that P&A access to the individual will interfere with the individual's treatment and therapy, and the time and circumstances under which the P&A can interview the individual. If the physician states that the individual cannot be interviewed in the next 24 hours, the P&A and the service provider shall engage in a good faith interactive process to determine when and under what circumstances the P&A can interview the individual. If the P&A and the service provider are unable to agree upon the time and circumstance, they shall select a mutually agreeable independent physician who will determine when and under what circumstances the individual may be interviewed. The expense of the independent physician's services shall be paid for by the service provider. Individuals with developmental disabilities subject to the requirements in this paragraph include adults and minors who have legal guardians or conservators.

        (2) P&A activities shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with service provider programs, respect individuals with developmental disabilities' privacy interests, and honor a recipient's request to terminate an interview. This access is for the purpose of:

        (i) Providing information, training, and referral for programs addressing the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities, information and training about individual rights, and the protection and advocacy services available from the P&A system, including the name, address, and telephone number of the P&A system. P&As shall be permitted to post, in an area which individuals with developmental disabilities receive services, a poster which states the protection and advocacy services available from the P&A system, including the name, address and telephone number of the P&A system.

        (ii) Monitoring compliance with respect to the rights and safety of individuals with developmental disabilities; and

        (iii) Access including, but is not limited to inspecting, viewing, photographing, and video recording all areas of a service provider's premises or under the service provider's supervision or control which are used by individuals with developmental disabilities or are accessible to them. This authority does not include photographing or video recording individuals with developmental disabilities unless they consent or State laws allow such activities.

        (d) Unaccompanied access to individuals with developmental disabilities including, but not limited to, the opportunity to meet and communicate privately with individuals regularly, both formally and informally, by telephone, mail and in person. This authority shall also include the opportunity to meet, communicate with, or interview any individual with a developmental disability, including a person thought to be the subject of abuse, who might be reasonably believed by the P&A system to have knowledge of an incident under investigation or non-compliance with respect to the rights and safety of individuals with developmental disabilities. Except as otherwise required by law the P&A shall not be required to provide the name or other identifying information regarding the individual with a disability with whom it plans to meet; neither may the P&A be required to justify or explain its interaction with such persons.

        § 1326.28   Confidentiality of State Protection and Advocacy System records.

#### § § 1326.28

        (a) A P&A shall, at minimum, comply with the confidentiality provisions of all applicable Federal and State laws.

        (b) Records maintained by the P&A system are the property of the P&A system which must protect them from loss, damage, tampering, unauthorized use, or tampering. The P&A system must:

        (1) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, keep confidential all records and information, including information contained in any automated electronic database pertaining to:

        (i) Clients;

        (ii) Individuals who have been provided general information or technical assistance on a particular matter;

        (iii) The identity of individuals who report incidents of abuse or neglect, or who furnish information that forms the basis for a determination that probable cause exists; and

        (iv) Names of individuals who have received services, supports or other assistance, and who provided information to the P&A for the record.

        (v) Peer review records.

        (2) Have written policies governing the access, storage, duplication and release of information from client records, including the release of information peer review records.

        (3) Obtain written consent from the client, or from his or her legal representative; individuals who have been provided general information or technical assistance on a particular matter; and individuals who furnish reports or information that form the basis for a determination of probable cause, before releasing information concerning such individuals to those not otherwise authorized to receive it.

        (c) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent the P&A system from issuing a public report of the results of an investigation which maintains the confidentiality of the individuals listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or reporting the results of an investigation in a manner which maintains the confidentiality of such individuals, to responsible investigative or enforcement agencies should an investigation reveal information concerning the service provider, its staff, or employees warranting possible sanctions or corrective action. This information may be reported to agencies responsible for service provider licensing or accreditation, employee discipline, employee licensing or certification, or criminal investigation or prosecution.

        (d) Notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements of this section, the P&A may make a report to investigative or enforcement agencies, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, which reveals the identity of an individual with developmental disability, and information relating to his or her status or treatment:

        (1) When the system has received a complaint that the individual has been or may be subject to abuse and neglect, or has probable cause (which can be the result of monitoring or other activities including media reports and newspaper articles) to believe that such individual has been or may be subject to abuse or neglect;

        (2) When the system determines that there is probable cause to believe the health or safety of the individual is in serious and immediate jeopardy; or

        (3) In any case of the death of an individual whom the system believes may have had a developmental disability.

#### § § 1326.31

        (a) The Council shall issue a public notice about the availability of the proposed State plan or State plan amendment(s) for comment. The notice shall be published in formats accessible to individuals with developmental disabilities and the general public ( public forums, Web sites, newspapers, and other current technologies) and shall provide a 45-day period for public review and comment. The Council shall take into account comments submitted within that period, and respond in the State plan to significant comments and suggestions. A summary of the Council's responses to State plan comments shall be submitted with the State plan and made available for public review. This document shall be made available in accessible formats upon request.

        (b) The State plan or amendment must be submitted to AIDD 45 days prior to the fiscal year for which it is applicable.

        (c) Failure to submit an approvable State plan or amendment prior to the Federal fiscal year for which it is applicable may result in the loss of Federal financial participation. Plans received during a quarter of the Federal fiscal year are approved back to the first day of the quarter so costs incurred from that point forward are approvable. Costs resulting from obligations incurred during the period of the fiscal year for which an approved plan is not in effect are not eligible for Federal financial participation.

        (d) The Secretary, or his or her designee, must approve any State plan or plan amendment provided it meets the requirements of the Act and this regulation.

        (a) Based on section 124(c)(5)(J) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15024(c)(5)(J)), the State plan must assure fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interest of all institutional employees affected by actions under the plan to provide community living activities. The State must inform employees of the State's decision to provide for community living activities. Specific arrangements for the protection of affected employees must be developed through negotiations between the appropriate State authorities and employees or their representatives.

        (b) Fair and equitable arrangements must include procedures that provide for the impartial resolution of disputes between the State and an employee concerning the interpretation, application, and enforcement of protection arrangements. To the maximum extent practicable, these arrangements must include provisions for:

        (1) The preservation of rights and benefits;

        (2) Guaranteeing employment to employees affected by action under the plan to provide alternative community living arrangements; and

        (3) Employee training and retraining programs.

        § 1326.34   Designated State Agency.

#### § § 1326.34

        (a) The Designated State Agency shall provide the required assurances and other support services as requested and negotiated by the Council. These include:

        (1) Provision of financial reporting and other services as provided under section 125(d)(3)(D) of the Act; and

        (2) Information and direction, as appropriate, on procedures on the hiring, supervision, and assignment of staff in accordance with State law.

        (b) If the State Council on Developmental Disabilities requests a review by the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) of the Designated State Agency, the Council must provide documentation of the reason for change, and recommend a new preferred Designated State Agency by the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable).

        (c) After the review is completed by the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable), and if no change is made, a majority of the non-State agency members of the Council may appeal to the Secretary, or his or her designee, for a review of the Designated State Agency if the Council's independence as an advocate is not assured because of the actions or inactions of the Designated State agency.

        (d) The following steps apply to the appeal of the Governor's (or State legislature, if applicable) designation of the Designated State Agency.

        (1) Prior to an appeal to the Secretary, or his or her designee, the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, must give a 30 day written notice, by certified mail, to the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) of the majority of non-State members' intention to appeal the designation of the Designated State Agency.

        (2) The appeal must clearly identify the grounds for the claim that the Council's independence as an advocate is not assured because of the action or inactions of the Designated State Agency.

        (3) Upon receipt of the appeal from the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, the Secretary, or his or her designee, will notify the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable), by certified mail, that the appeal has been received and will be acted upon within 60 days. The Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) shall within 10 working days from the receipt of the Secretary's, or his or her designated person's, notification provide written comments to the Secretary, or his or her designee, (with a copy sent by registered or certified mail to the Council) on the claims in the Council's appeal. Either party may request, and the Secretary, or his or her designee, may grant, an opportunity for an informal meeting with the Secretary, or his or her designee, at which representatives from both parties will present their views on the issues in the appeal. The meeting will be held within 20 working days of the submission of written comments by the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable). The Secretary, or his or her designee, will promptly notify the parties of the date and place of the meeting.

        (4) The Secretary, or his or her designee, will review the issue(s) and provide a final written decision within 60 days following receipt of the appeal from the State Council on Developmental Disabilities. If the determination is made that the Designated State Agency should be redesignated, the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) must provide written assurance of compliance within 45 days from receipt of the decision.

        (5) Anytime during this appeals process the State Council on Developmental Disabilities may withdraw such request if resolution has been reached with the Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) on the Designated State Agency. The Governor (or State legislature, if applicable) must notify the Secretary, or his or her designee, in writing of such a decision.

        (e) The Designated State Agency may authorize the Council to contract with State agencies other than the Designated State Agency to perform functions of the Designated State Agency.

        § 1326.35   Allowable and non-allowable costs for Federal assistance to State Councils on Developmental Disabilities.

#### § § 1326.35

        (a) Under this subpart, Federal funding is available for costs resulting from obligations incurred under the approved State plan for the necessary expenses of administering the plan, which may include the establishment and maintenance of the State Council, and all programs, projects, and activities carried out under the State plan.

        (b) Expenditures which are not allowable for Federal financial participation are:

        (1) Costs incurred by institutions or other residential or non-residential programs which do not comply with the Congressional findings with respect to the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities in section 109 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15009).

        (2) Costs incurred for activities not provided for in the approved State plan; and

        (3) Costs not allowed under other applicable statutes, Departmental regulations, or issuances of the Office of Management and Budget.

        (c) Expenditure of funds that supplant State and local funds are not allowed. Supplanting occurs when State or local funds previously used to fund activities under the State plan are replaced by Federal funds for the same purpose. However, supplanting does not occur if State or local funds are replaced with Federal funds for a particular activity or purpose in the approved State plan if the replaced State or local funds are then used for other activities or purposes in the approved State plan.

        (d) For purposes of determining aggregate minimum State share of expenditures, there are three categories of expenditures:

        (1) Expenditures for projects or activities undertaken directly by the Council and Council staff to implement State plan activities, as described in section 126(a)(3) of the Act, require no non-Federal aggregate of the necessary costs of such activities.

        (2) Expenditures for projects whose activities or products target individuals with developmental disabilities who live in urban or rural poverty areas, as determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, but not carried out directly by the Council and Council staff, as described in section 126(a)(2) of the Act, shall have non-Federal funding of at least 10 percent in the aggregate of the necessary costs of such projects.

        (3) All other projects not directly carried out by the Council and Council staff shall have non-Federal funding of at least 25 percent in the aggregate of the necessary costs of such projects.

        (e) The Council may vary the non-Federal funding required on a project-by-project, activity-by-activity basis (both poverty and non-poverty activities), including requiring no non-Federal funding from particular projects or activities as the Council deems appropriate so long as the requirement for aggregate non-Federal funding is met.

        § 1326.36   Final disapproval of the State plan or plan amendments.

#### § § 1326.36

        The Department will disapprove any State plan or plan amendment only after the following procedures have been complied with:

        (a) The State plan has been submitted to AIDD for review. If after contacting the State on issues with the plan with no resolution, a detailed written analysis of the reasons for recommending disapproval shall be prepared and provided to the State Council and State Designated Agency.

        (b) Once the Secretary, or his or her designee, has determined that the State plan, in whole or in part, is not approvable, notice of this determination shall be sent to the State with appropriate references to the records, provisions of the statute and regulations, and all relevant interpretations of applicable laws and regulations. The notification of the decision must inform the State of its right to appeal in accordance with subpart E of this part.

        (c) The Secretary's, or his or her designee's, decision has been forwarded to the State Council and its Designated State Agency by certified mail with a return receipt requested.

        (d) A State has filed its request for a hearing with the Secretary, or his or her designee, within 21 days of the receipt of the decision. The request for a hearing must be sent by certified mail to the Secretary, or his or her designee. The date of mailing the request is considered the date of filing if it is supported by independent evidence of mailing. Otherwise the date of receipt shall be considered the date of filing.

        (f)  encompass models, methods, tools, applications, and devices, but are not necessarily limited to these types.

        § 1330.4   Stages of research.

#### § § 1330.4

        For any Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research Projects and Centers Program competition, the Department may require in the application materials for the competition that the applicant identify the stage(s) of research in which it will focus the work of its proposed project or center. The four stages of research are:

        (a)  mean the stage of research that generates hypotheses or theories through new and refined analyses of data, producing observational findings and creating other sources of research-based information. This research stage may include identifying or describing the barriers to and facilitators of improved outcomes of individuals with disabilities, as well as identifying or describing existing practices, programs, or policies that are associated with important aspects of the lives of individuals with disabilities. Results achieved under this stage of research may inform the development of interventions or lead to evaluations of interventions or policies. The results of the exploration and discovery stage of research may also be used to inform decisions or priorities;

        (b)  means the stage of research that focuses on generating and testing interventions that have the potential to improve outcomes for individuals with disabilities. _Intervention development_ involves determining the active components of possible interventions, developing measures that would be required to illustrate outcomes, specifying target populations, conducting field tests, and assessing the feasibility of conducting a well-designed intervention study. Results from this stage of research may be used to inform the design of a study to test the efficacy of an intervention;

        (c)  means the stage of research during which a project evaluates and tests whether an intervention is feasible, practical, and has the potential to yield positive outcomes for individuals with disabilities. Efficacy research may assess the strength of the relationships between an intervention and outcomes, and may identify factors or individual characteristics that affect the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. Efficacy research can inform decisions about whether there is sufficient evidence to support “scaling-up” an intervention to other sites and contexts. This stage of research may include assessing the training needed for wide-scale implementation of the intervention, and approaches to evaluation of the intervention in real-world applications; and

        (d)  means the stage of research during which a project analyzes whether an intervention is effective in producing improved outcomes for individuals with disabilities when implemented in a real-world setting. During this stage of research, a project tests the outcomes of an evidence-based intervention in different settings. The project examines the challenges to successful replication of the intervention, and the circumstances and activities that contribute to successful adoption of the intervention in real-world settings. This stage of research may also include well-designed studies of an intervention that has been widely adopted in practice, but lacks a sufficient evidence base to demonstrate its effectiveness.

        § 1330.5   Stages of development.

#### § § 1330.5

        For any Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research Projects and Centers Program competition, the Department may require in the notice inviting applications for the competition that the applicant identify the stage(s) of development in which it will focus the work of its proposed project or center. The three stages of development are:

        (a)  means the stage of development where key technical challenges are resolved. Stage activities may include recruiting study participants, verifying product requirements; implementing and testing (typically in controlled contexts) key concepts, components, or systems, and resolving technical challenges. A technology transfer plan is typically developed and transfer partner(s) identified; and plan implementation may have started. Stage results establish that a product concept is feasible.

        (b)  means the stage of development where a fully-integrated and working prototype, meeting critical technical requirements is created. Stage activities may include recruiting study participants, implementing and iteratively refining the prototype, testing the prototype in natural or less-controlled contexts, and verifying that all technical requirements are met. A technology transfer plan is typically ongoing in collaboration with the transfer partner(s). Stage results establish that a product embodiment is realizable.

        (c)  means the stage of development where a product is substantially adopted by its target population and used for its intended purpose. Stage activities typically include completing product refinements; and continued implementation of the technology transfer plan in collaboration with the transfer partner(s). Other activities include measuring users' awareness of the product, opinion of the product, decisions to adopt, use, and retain products; and identifying barriers and facilitators impacting product adoption. Stage results establish that a product is beneficial.

      (b)  This part sets forth the following:

      (1) Conditions of eligibility for the grant.

      (2) Minimum levels of funding for those States qualifying for the grants.

      (3) Reporting requirements.

      (c)  For purposes of this subpart, the term “State” includes (except where otherwise indicated by the context) the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.

      § 1331.2   Eligibility for grants.

#### § § 1331.2

      To be eligible for a grant under this subpart, the State must have an approved Medicare supplemental regulatory program under section 1882 of the Act and submit a timely application to ACL that meets the requirements of—

      (a) Section 4360 of Public Law 101-508 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-4);

      (b) This subpart; and

      (c) The applicable solicitation for grant applications issued by ACL.

      § 1331.3   Availability of grants.

#### § § 1331.3

      ACL awards grants to States subject to availability of funds, and if applicable, subject to the satisfactory progress in the State's project during the preceding grant period. The criteria by which progress is evaluated and the performance standards for determining whether satisfactory progress has been made are specified in the terms and conditions included in the notice of grant award sent to each State. ACL advises each State as to when to make application, what to include in the application, and provides information as to the timing of the grant award and the duration of the grant award. ACL also provides an estimate of the amount of funds that may be available to the State.

      § 1331.4   Number and size of grants.

#### § § 1331.4

      (a)  For available grant funds, up to and including $10,000,000, grants will be made to States according to the terms and formula in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For any available grant funds in excess of $10,000,000, distribution of grants will be at the discretion of ACL, and will be made according to criteria that ACL will communicate to the States via grant solicitation. ACL will provide information to each State as to what must be included in the application for grant funds. ACL awards the following type of grants:

      (1) New program grants.

      (2) Existing program enhancement grants.

      (b)  Subject to the availability of funds, each eligible State that submits an acceptable application receives a grant that includes a fixed amount (minimum funding level) and a variable amount.

      (1) A fixed portion is awarded to States in the following amounts:

      (i) Each of the 50 States, $75,000.

      (ii) The District of Columbia, $75,000.

      (iii) Puerto Rico, $75,000.

      (c)  (1) ACL bases the variable portion of the grant on—

      (i) The amount of available funds, and

      (ii) A comparison of each State with the average of all of the States (except the State being compared) with respect to three factors that relate to the size of the State's Medicare population and where that population resides.

      (2) The factors ACL uses to compare States' Medicare populations comprise separate components of the variable amount. These factors, and the extent to which they each contribute to the variable amount, are as follows:

      (i) Approximately 75 percent of the variable amount is based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries living in the State as a percentage of all Medicare beneficiaries nationwide.

      (ii) Approximately 10 percent of the variable amount is based on the percentage of the State's total population who are Medicare beneficiaries.

      (iii) Approximately 15 percent of the variable amount is based on the percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiaries that reside in rural areas (“rural areas” are defined as all areas not included within a metropolitan Statistical Area).

      (3) Based on the foregoing four factors (that is, the amount of available funds and the three comparative factors), ACL determines a variable rate for each participating State for each grant period.

      (d)  A State that receives an amount of grant funds under this subpart that differs from the amount requested in the budget submitted with its application must submit a revised budget to ACL, along with its acceptance of the grant award, which reflects the amount awarded.

      § 1331.5   Limitations.

#### § § 1331.5

      (a)  Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and in the terms and conditions in the notice of grant award, a State that receives a grant under this subpart may use the grant for any reasonable expenses for planning, developing, implementing and/or operating the program for which the grant is made as described in the solicitation for application for the grant.

      (b)  A State that receives a grant to supplement an existing program (that is, an existing program enhancement grant)—

      (1) Must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial award of a grant made under this subpart and funded through other sources (including in-kind contributions).

      (2) Must maintain the activities of the program at least at the level that those activities were conducted immediately preceding the initial award of a grant made under this subpart.

      § 1331.6   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 1331.6

      A State that receives a grant under this subpart must submit at least one annual report to ACL and any additional reports as ACL may prescribe in the notice of grant award. ACL advises the State of the requirements concerning the frequency, timing, and contents of reports in the notice of grant award that it sends to the State.

      § 1331.7   Administration.

#### § § 1331.7

      (a)  Administration of grants will be in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 45 CFR part 75 (“Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments”), the terms of the solicitation, and the terms of the notice of grant award.

      (b)  ACL provides notice to each applicant regarding ACL's decision on an application for grant funding under § 1331.4.

      (c)  Any applicant for a grant under this subpart has the right to appeal ACL's determination regarding its application. Appeal procedures are governed by the regulations at 45 CFR part 16 (Procedures of the Departmental Grant Appeals Board).

        45 CFR Part 81 Practice and procedure for hearing under part 80.

        45 CFR Part 84 Nondiscrimination on the basis of handicap in federally assisted programs.

        45 CFR Part 86 Nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance.

        45 CFR Part 91 Nondiscrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from HHS.

        (b) —(1)  Recipients of financial assistance under sections 803, 804, and 805 of the Act are required to provide a matching share of 20 percent of the approved cost of the assisted project.

        (2)  If an applicant or recipient wishes to request a waiver of the requirement for a 20 percent non-Federal matching share, the following conditions must be met:

        (i) If an applicant for an initial award or an applicant for a non-competing continuation award anticipates that it will be unable to meet the cost-sharing or matching requirement, the applicant may request a waiver of the 20 percent non-Federal matching share. It must include with its application for funding, the submission of a revised SF424A, a written justification that clearly explains why the applicant cannot provide the matching share including the amount of non-Federal share to be waived, and how it meets the criteria indicated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For an applicant for an initial award, or an applicant seeking a non-competing continuation award, a request for a waiver must be submitted at the time of the initial application or non-competing continuation (NCC) application.

        (ii) If a recipient is unable to contribute part or all of the required non-Federal matching share during a budget period due to an emergency situation such as a natural disaster, man-made disaster, act of terrorism, public health emergency, or other qualifying event, the recipient may request a waiver of all or part of the requirement for a 20 percent non-Federal matching share specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Any requests for an emergency waiver may be submitted at any time during a budget period as soon as the adverse effect is known to the recipient and must be submitted in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (3)  Both of the following criteria must be met for an applicant or recipient to be eligible for a waiver of the non-Federal matching requirement:

        (i) Applicant or recipient lacks the available resources to meet part or all of the non-Federal matching requirement. This must be documented by an institutional audit if available, or a full disclosure of applicant's or recipient's total assets and liabilities.

        (ii) Applicants or recipients can document that reasonable efforts to obtain cash or in-kind contributions for the purposes of the project from third parties have been unsuccessful, including evidence and the results of such attempts. Evidence of such efforts can include letters from possible sources of funding or any relevant correspondence, indicating that the requested resources are not available for that project. The requests must be appropriate to the source in terms of project purpose, applicant eligibility, and reasonableness of the request.

        (4)  For a waiver to be approved, ANA must determine that it will not prevent the award of other grants at levels it believes are desirable for the purposes of the program. Waiver of all or part of the non-Federal share shall apply only to the budget period for which application was made.

        (c)  (1) Applications for financial assistance under this Part must include either a statement of compliance with the maintenance of effort requirement contained in section 803(c) of the Act, or a request for a waiver, in accordance with criteria established in this paragraph.

        (2) To be eligible for a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement, the applicant must demonstrate to ANA that the organization whose funds previously supported the project discontinued its support:

        (i) As a result of funding limitations; and

        (ii) Not as a result of an adverse evaluation of the project's purpose or the manner in which it was conducted; and

        (iii) Not because it was anticipated that Federal funds would replace the original source of project funding.

        (3) In addition, the applicant must demonstrate in the request for a waiver that the maintenance of effort requirement would result in insurmountable hardship for the recipient or would otherwise be inconsistent with the purposes of this part.

        (d)  (1) Each subgrant awarded to a delegate agency must have specific prior approval by ANA. Such delegation must be formalized by written agreement.

        (2) The agreement must specify the activities to be performed by the delegate agency, the time schedule, the policies and procedures to be followed, the dollar limitations, and the costs allowed. The applicant must submit a budget for each delegate agency as part of its application.

        (e)  ANA funds may not be used by recipients to purchase real property.

        (f)  The costs of salaries and expenses of the Office of Chief Executive of a federally recognized Indian tribal government (as defined in § 75.2 of this title ) are allowable, provided that such costs exclude any portion of salaries and expenses of the Office of Chief Executive that are a cost of general government and provided they are related to a project assisted under this part.

        § 1336.51   Project period.

#### § § 1336.51

        The Notice of Financial Assistance Awarded will specify the period for which support is intended, although the Department makes funding commitments only for one budget period at a time. Financial assistance under section 803 of the Act may be ongoing, subject to policy decisions and funding limitations.

        § 1336.52   Appeals.

#### § § 1336.52

        (a)  Recipients whose financial assistance has been suspended or terminated, or whose non-competing continuation applications for refunding have been denied, may appeal such decisions using the procedures described in this section. Denial of an application for refunding means the refusal to fund a non-competing continuation application for a budget period within a previously approved project period.

        (b)  Procedures for and definitions of suspension and termination of financial assistance are published in 45 CFR 75.371 through 75.380. Appeals from a denial of refunding will be treated the same procedurally as appeals to termination of financial assistance. The term “denial of refunding” does not include policy decisions to eliminate one or more activities of an approved project. A decision not to fund an application at the end of the recipients's project period is not a “denial of refunding” and is not subject to appeal.

        (c)  (1) A recipient shall be given an initial written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the suspension or termination of financial assistance except in emergency situations, which occur when Federal property is in imminent danger of dissipation, or when life, health, or safety is endangered. During this period of time, the recipient has the opportunity to show cause to ANA why such action should not be taken.

        (2) A recipient who has received final written notice of termination or denial of refunding, or whose financial assistance will be suspended for more than 30 days, or who has other appealable disputes with ANA as provided by 45 CFR part 16 may request review by the Departmental Grant Appeals Board under the provisions of 45 CFR part 16.

        (3) If a recipient appeals a suspension of more than 30 days which subsequently results in termination of financial assistance, both actions may be considered simultaneously by the Departmental Grant Appeals Board.

        (2) Potential market for the product or service;

#### § § 1336.67

        The Loan Administrator may require any applicant for a loan from the RLF to provide such collateral as the Loan Administrator determines to be necessary to secure the loan. (Section 803A(b)(3))

        (a)  The availability of collateral security normally is considered an important factor in making loans. The types and amount of collateral security required should be governed by the relative strengths and weaknesses of other credit factors. The taking of collateral as security should be considered with respect to each loan. Collateral security should be sufficient to provide the lender reasonable protection from loss in the case of adversity, but such security or lack thereof should not be used as the primary basis for deciding whether to extend credit.

        (b)  Security interests which may be taken by the lender include, but are not limited to, liens on real or personal property, including leasehold interests; assignments of income and accounts receivable; and liens on inventory or proceeds of inventory sales as well as marketable securities and cash collateral accounts.

        (1)  Liens ordinarily should be taken on licensed motor vehicles, boats or aircraft purchased hereunder in order to be able to transfer title easily should the lender need to declare a default or repossess the property.

        (2)  Hazard insurance up to the amount of the loan or the replacement value of the property secured (whichever is less) must be taken naming the lender as beneficiary. Such insurance includes fire and extended coverage, public liability, property damage, and other appropriate types of hazard insurance.

        (3)  Real property serving as collateral security must be appraised by a qualified appraiser. For all other types of property, a valuation shall be made using any recognized, standard technique (including standard reference manuals), and this valuation shall be described in the loan file.

        (c)  The lender may require collateral security or additional security at any time during the term of the loan if after review and monitoring an assessment indicates the need for such security.

        § 1336.68   Defaults, uncollectible loans, liquidations: Responsibilities of the Loan Administrator.

#### § § 1336.68

        (a) Prior to making loans from the RLF, the Loan Administrator will develop and obtain the Commissioner's approval for written procedures and definitions pertaining to defaults and collections of payments. (section 803A(b)(4))

        (b) The Loan Administrator will provide a copy of such procedures and definitions to each applicant for a loan at the time the application is made. (section 803A(b)(4))

        (c) The Loan Administrator will report to the Commissioner whenever a loan recipient is 90 days in arrears in the repayment of principal or interest or has failed to comply with the terms of the loan agreement. After making reasonable efforts to collect amounts payable, as specified in the written procedures, the Loan Administrator shall notify the Commissioner whenever a loan is uncollectible at reasonable cost. The notice shall include recommendations for future action to be taken by the Loan Administrator. (section 803A(c)(1) and (2))

        (d) Upon receiving such notices, the Commissioner will, as appropriate, instruct the Loan Administrator:

        (1) To demand the immediate and full repayment of the loan;

        (2) To continue with its collection activities;

        (3) To cancel, adjust, compromise, or reduce the amount of such loan;

        (4) To modify any term or condition of such loan, including any term or condition relating to the rate of interest or the time of payment of any installment of principal or interest, or portion thereof, that is payable under such loan;

        (5) To discontinue any further advance of funds contemplated by the loan agreement;

        (6) To take possession of any or all collateral given as security and in the case of individuals, corporations, partnerships or cooperative associations, the property purchased with the borrowed funds;

        (7) To prosecute legal action against the borrower or against the officers of the borrowing organization;

        (8) To prevent further disbursement of credit funds under the control of the borrower;

        (9) To assign or sell at a public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of for cash or credit any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal or real property or security assigned to or held by the Loan Administrator; or

        (10) To liquidate or arrange for the operation of economic enterprises financed with the revolving loan until the indebtedness is paid or until the Loan Administrator has received acceptable assurance of its repayment and compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.

        (d) The Loan Administrator must submit to the Department a quarterly SF-269, Financial Status Report, or any equivalent report required by the Department.

        § 1336.71   Administrative costs.

#### § § 1336.71

        Reasonable administrative costs of the RLF may be paid out of the loan fund. The grant award agreement between the Loan Administrator and ANA will set forth the allowable administrative costs of the loan fund during the five-year demonstration period.

      Subpart B—Runaway and Homeless Youth Program Grants

        § 1351.10   What is the purpose of Runaway and Homeless Youth Program grants?

#### § § 1351.10

        (a) The purpose of Runaway and Homeless Youth Program grants is to establish or strengthen community-based projects to provide runaway prevention, outreach, shelter, and transition services to runaway, homeless, or street youth or youth at risk of running away or becoming homeless.

        (b) Youth who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from home without parental permission are disproportionately subject to serious health, behavioral, and emotional problems. They lack sufficient resources to obtain care and may live on the street for extended periods, unable to achieve stable, safe living arrangements that at times put them in danger. Many are urgently in need of shelter, which, depending on the type of Runaway and Homeless Youth project, can include host family homes, drop-in centers, congregate care, or supervised apartments, and services, including services that are linguistically appropriate, responsive to their complex social identities ( race, ethnicity, nationality, religion/spirituality, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical ability, language, beliefs, values, behavior patterns, or customs), and acknowledge the environment they come from. Runaway and Homeless Youth grant services should have a positive youth development approach that ensures a young person has a sense of safety and structure; belonging and membership; self-worth and social contribution; independence and control over one's life; skills to develop plans for the future and set goals; and closeness in interpersonal relationships. To make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless youth, and street youth also need opportunities to complete high school or earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment. HHS operates three programs to carry out these purposes through direct local services: The Basic Center Program; the Transitional Living Program (including Maternity Group Homes); and the Street Outreach Program. HHS operates three additional activities to support achievement of these purposes: Research, evaluation, and service projects; a national communications system to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with service providers; and technical assistance and training.

        (1) For Basic Center Program grants, records maintained on individual runaway and homeless youth shall not be disclosed without the informed consent of the individual youth and parent or legal guardian to anyone other than another agency compiling statistical records or a government agency involved in the disposition of criminal charges against an individual runaway and homeless youth;

        (2) For Transitional Living Programs, records maintained on individual homeless youth shall not be disclosed without the informed consent of the individual youth to anyone other than an agency compiling statistical records;

        (3) Research, evaluation, and statistical reports funded by grants provided under section 343 of the Act are allowed to be based on individual data, but only if such data are de-identified in ways that preclude disclosing information on identifiable individuals; and

        (4) Youth served by a Runaway and Homeless Youth project shall have the right to review their records; to correct a record or file a statement of disagreement; and to be apprised of the individuals who have reviewed their records.

        (b) State law protection. HHS policies regarding confidential information and experimentation and treatment shall not apply if HHS finds that state law is more protective of the rights of runaway or otherwise homeless youth.

        (c) Procedures shall be established for the training of project staff in the protection of these rights and for the secure storage of records.

        § 1351.22   What additional requirements apply to these programs?

#### § § 1351.22

        (a)  Service delivery and staff training must comprehensively address the individual strengths and needs of youth as well as be language appropriate, gender appropriate (interventions that are sensitive to the diverse experiences of male, female, and transgender youth and consistent with the gender identity of participating youth), and culturally sensitive and respectful of the complex social identities of youth ( race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion/spirituality, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or cognitive ability, language, beliefs, values, behavior patterns, or customs). No runaway youth or homeless youth shall, on any of the foregoing bases, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or activity funded in whole or in part under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.

        (1) The criteria that grantees adopt to determine eligibility for the program, or any activity or service, may include an assessment of the needs of each applicant, and the health and safety of other beneficiaries, among other factors.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (b)  No youth shall be subject to medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment without the consent of the youth and, for youth under the age of emancipation in their state of residence, consent of a parent or guardian, if required by state law.

        (c)  Employees or individuals participating in a program or project under the Act shall not use their positions for a purpose that is, or gives the appearance of being, motivated by a desire for private gain for themselves or others, particularly those with whom they have family, business or other ties.

        § 1351.23   What are the additional requirements that apply to the Basic Center, Transitional Living and Street Outreach Program grants?

#### § § 1351.23

        To improve the administration of these Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs by increasing the capacity of Runaway and Homeless Youth projects to deliver services, by improving their performance in delivering services, and by providing for the evaluation of performance:

        (a) Grantees shall participate in technical assistance, monitoring, and short-term training as a condition of funding, as determined necessary by HHS, in such areas as: Aftercare services and counseling; background checks; core competencies of youth workers; core support services; crisis intervention techniques; culturally and linguistically sensitive services; participation in or development of coordinated networks of private nonprofit agencies and/or public agencies to provide services; ethics and staff safety; fiscal management; low cost community alternatives for runaway or otherwise homeless youth; positive youth development; program management; risk and protective factors related to youth homelessness; screening and assessment practices; shelter facility staff development; special populations (tribal youth; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ), and intersex youth; youth with disabilities; youth victims of trafficking, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse); trauma and the effects of trauma on youth; use of evidence-based and evidence-informed interventions; and youth and family counseling. It is not a requirement that every staff person receives training in every subject but all staff members who work directly with youth should receive training sufficient to meet the stated core-competencies of youth workers.

        (b) Grantees shall coordinate their activities with the 24-hour National toll-free and Internet communication system, which links Runaway and Homeless Youth projects and other service providers with runaway or otherwise homeless youth, as appropriate to the specific activities provided by the grantee.

        (c) Grantees shall submit statistical reports profiling the clients served and providing management and performance information in accordance with guidance provided by HHS.

        (d) Grantees shall perform outreach to locate runaway and homeless youth and to coordinate activities with other organizations serving the same or similar client populations, such as child welfare agencies, juvenile justice systems, schools, and Continuums of Care, as defined by HUD.

        (e) Grantees shall develop and implement a plan for addressing youth who have run away from foster care placement or correctional institutions, in accordance with federal, state, or local laws or regulations that apply to these situations. In accordance with section 312(b)(4) of the Act, Basic Center grantees must also develop a plan that ensures the return of runaway and homeless youth who have run away from the correctional institution back to the correctional institution.

        (f) Grantees shall take steps to ensure that youth who are or should be under the legal jurisdiction of the juvenile justice or child welfare systems obtain and receive services from those systems until such time as they are released from the jurisdiction of those systems.

        (g) Grantees shall develop and document plans that address steps to be taken in case of a local or national situation that poses risk to the health and safety of staff and youth. Emergency preparedness plans should, at a minimum, include routine preventative maintenance of facilities as well as preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. The plan should contain strategies for addressing evacuation, security, food, medical supplies, and notification of youths' families, as appropriate. In the event of an evacuation due to specific facility issues, such as a fire, loss of utilities, or mandatory evacuation by the local authorities, an alternative location needs to be designated and included in the plan. Grantees must immediately provide notification to their project officer and grants officer when evacuation plans are executed.

        (h) Grantees shall ensure that all shelters that they operate are licensed and determine that any shelters to which they regularly refer clients have evidence of current licensure, in states or localities with licensure requirements. Grantees shall promptly report to HHS instances in which shelters are cited for failure to meet licensure or related requirements, or lose licensure. For grantee-operated facilities, failure to meet any applicable state or local legal requirements as a condition of operation may be grounds for grant termination.

        (i) Grantees shall utilize and integrate into the operation of their projects the principles of positive youth development, including healthy messages, safe and structured places, adult role models, skill development, and opportunities to serve others.

        (j) No later than October 1, 2017, grantees shall have a plan, procedures, and standards for ensuring background checks on all employees, contractors, volunteers, and consultants who have regular and unsupervised private contact with youth served by the grantee, and on all adults who reside in or operate host homes. The plans, procedures, and standards must identify the background check findings that would disqualify an applicant from consideration for employment to provide services for which assistance is made available in accordance with this part.

        (1) Required background checks include:

        (i) State or tribal criminal history records, including fingerprint checks;

        (ii) Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history records, including fingerprint checks, to the extent FSYB determines this to be practicable and specifies the requirement in a Funding Opportunity Announcement that is applicable to a grantee's award;

        (iii) Child abuse and neglect state registry check, to the extent FSYB determines this to be practicable and specifies the requirement in a Funding Opportunity Announcement that is applicable to a grantee's award;

        (iv) Sex offender registry check; and,

        (v) Any other checks required under state or tribal law.

        (2) Programs must document the justification for any hire where an arrest, pending criminal charge or conviction, is present.

        (k) Grantees shall provide such other services and meet such additional requirements as HHS determines are necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute, as appropriate to the services and activities for which they are funded. These services and requirements are articulated in the funding opportunity announcements and other instructions issued by the Secretary or secretarial designees. This includes operational instructions and standards of execution determined by the Secretary or secretarial designees to be necessary to properly perform or document meeting the requirements applicable to particular programs or projects.

        § 1351.24   What are the additional requirements that the Basic Center Program grantees must meet?

#### § § 1351.24

        (a) Grantees shall have an intake procedure that is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to all youth seeking services and temporary shelter that addresses and responds to immediate needs for crisis counseling, food, clothing, shelter, and health care services.

        (b) Grantees shall provide, either directly or through arrangements, access to temporary shelter 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

        (c) Grantees shall provide trauma-informed case management, counseling and referral services that meet client needs and that encourage, when in the best interests of the youth particularly with regard to safety, the involvement of parents or legal guardians.

        (d) Grantees shall provide additional core support services to clients both residentially and non-residentially as appropriate. The core services must include case planning, skill building, recreation and leisure activities.

        (e) Grantees shall, as soon as feasible and no later than 72 hours of the youth entering the program, contact the parents, legal guardians or other relatives of each youth according to the best interests of the youth. If a grantee determines that it is not in the best interest of the client to contact the parents, legal guardian or other relatives of the client, or if the grantee is unable to locate, or the youth refuses to disclose the contact information of, the parent, legal guardian or other relative of the client, they must:

        (1) Inform another adult identified by the child;

        (2) Document why it is not in the client's best interest to contact the parent, legal guardian or other relative, or why they are not able to contact the parent, legal guardian or other relative; and

        (3) Send a copy of the documentation to the regional program specialist for review.

        (f) Additional requirements included in the funding opportunity announcement.

#### § § 1351.26

        (a) Basic Center and Transitional Living grantees shall develop and implement an aftercare plan, covering at least 3 months, to stay in contact with youth who leave the program in order to ensure their ongoing safety and access to services. A youth's individual aftercare plan shall outline what services were and will be provided as well as the youth's housing status during and after the program. The plan shall be provided to the youth in exit counseling or before. Follow-up efforts shall be made for all youth. For those contacted after 3 months, the plan shall be updated to record the rate of participation and completion of the services in the plan at 3 months after exiting the program. In accordance with section 312(b)(5) of the Act, as possible, Basic Center grantees shall also provide a plan for providing counseling and aftercare services to youth who are returned beyond the state in which the runaway and homeless youth service is located.

        (b) Basic Center and Transitional Living grantees shall develop and implement a plan for health care services referrals for youth during the service and aftercare periods. Such referral plans shall include health care services and referrals and counseling on insurance coverage through family health insurance plans, or to agencies that assist in enrolling persons in Medicaid or in insurance plans offered under Affordable Care Act exchanges.

        (c) Basic Center and Transitional Living grantees shall develop and implement a plan to assist youth to stay connected with their schools or to obtain appropriate educational services, training, or employment services. This includes coordination with McKinney-Vento school district liaisons, designated under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, to assure that runaway and homeless youth are provided information about the services available under that Act. This also includes coordination with local employment and employment training coordinating agencies or programs, coordination with local college placement services, and providing access to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application.

    PART 1355—GENERAL

### Part 1355

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 620  42 U.S.C. 670  42 U.S.C. 1302.

      § 1355.10   Scope.

#### § § 1355.10

      Unless otherwise specified, part 1355 applies to States and Indian Tribes and contains general requirements for Federal financial participation under titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act.

> [61 FR 58653, Nov. 18, 1996]

      § 1355.20   Definitions.

#### § § 1355.20

      (a) Unless otherwise specified, the following terms as they appear in 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356 and 1357 of this title are defined as follows—

      means the Social Security _Act_, as amended.

      means the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U. S. Department of Health and Human Services.

      means the method provided by State law, or for a Tribal title IV-E agency, Tribal law, which establishes the legal relationship of parent and child between persons who are not so related by birth, with the same mutual rights and obligations that exist between children and their birth parents. This relationship can only be termed “adoption” after the legal process is complete.

      means the definition contained in 42 U.S.C. 5106(g)(2).

      means a private child care institution, or a public child care institution which accommodates no more than twenty-five children, and is licensed by the licensing authority responsible for licensing or approval of institutions of this type as meeting the standards established for such licensing. The licensing authority must be a State authority in the State in which the child care institution is located, a Tribal authority with respect to a child care institution on or near an Indian Reservation, or a Tribal authority of a Tribal title IV-E agency with respect to a child care institution in the Tribal title IV-E agency's service area. This definition must not include detention facilities, forestry camps, training schools, or any other facility operated primarily for the detention of children who are determined to be delinquent.

      means the _Commissioner_ on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

      means the earlier of: The date of the first judicial finding that the child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect; or, the date that is 60 calendar days after the date on which the child is removed from the home pursuant to § 1356.21(k). A title IV-E agency may use a date earlier than that required in this definition, such as the date the child is physically removed from the home. This definition determines the date used in calculating all time period requirements for the periodic reviews, permanency hearings, and termination of parental rights provision in section 475(5) of the Act and for providing time-limited reunification services described at section 431(a)(7) of the Act. The definition has no relationship to establishing initial title IV-E eligibility.

      means the United States _Department_ of Health and Human Services.

      in the context of the definition of child care institution in section 472(c)(2) of the Act means a physically restricting facility for the care of children who require secure custody pending court adjudication, court disposition, execution of a court order or after commitment.

      as used in § 1355.38, means any organization or agency (e.g., a private child placing agency) that is separate and independent of the title IV-E agency; performs title IV-E functions pursuant to a contract or subcontract with the title IV-E agency; and, receives title IV-E funds. A State or Tribal court is not an “entity” for the purposes of § 1355.38 except if an administrative arm of the State or Tribal court carries out title IV-E administrative functions pursuant to a contract with the title IV-E agency.

      means 24-hour substitute care for children placed away from their parents or guardians and for whom the title IV-E agency has placement and care responsibility. This includes, but is not limited to, placements in foster family homes, foster homes of relatives, group homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities, child care institutions, and preadoptive homes. A child is in foster care in accordance with this definition regardless of whether the foster care facility is licensed and payments are made by the State, Tribal or local agency for the care of the child, whether adoption subsidy payments are being made prior to the finalization of an adoption, or whether there is Federal matching of any payments that are made.

      are payments made on behalf of a child eligible for title IV-E foster care to cover the cost of (and the cost of providing) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, a child's personal incidentals, liability insurance with respect to a child, and reasonable travel for a child's visitation with family, or other caretakers. Local travel associated with providing the items listed above is also an allowable expense. In the case of child care institutions, such term must include the reasonable costs of administration and operation of such institutions as are necessarily required to provide the items described in the preceding sentences. “Daily supervision” for which foster care maintenance payments may be made includes:

      (1) —licensed child care, when work responsibilities preclude foster parents from being at home when the child for whom they have care and responsibility in foster care is not in school, licensed child care when the foster parent is required to participate, without the child, in activities associated with parenting a child in foster care that are beyond the scope of ordinary parental duties, such as attendance at administrative or judicial reviews, case conferences, or foster parent training. Payments to cover these costs may be: included in the basic foster care maintenance payment; a separate payment to the foster parent, or a separate payment to the child care provider; and

      (2) —routine day-to-day direction and arrangements to ensure the well-being and safety of the child.

      means, for the purpose of title IV-E eligibility, the home of an individual or family licensed or approved as meeting the standards established by the licensing or approval authority(ies), that provides 24-hour out-of-home care for children. The licensing or approval authority must be a state authority in the state in which the foster family home is located, a tribal authority with respect to a foster family home on or near an Indian Reservation, or a tribal authority of a tribal title IV-E agency with respect to a foster family home in the tribal title IV-E agency's service area. Agencies may establish one set of foster family home licensing or approval standards for all relative or kinship foster family homes that are different from the set of standards used to license or approve all non-relative foster family homes. Anything less than full licensure or approval is insufficient for meeting title IV-E eligibility requirements. Title IV-E agencies may, however, claim title IV-E reimbursement during the period of time between the date a prospective foster family home satisfies all requirements for licensure or approval and the date the actual license is issued, not to exceed 60 days.

      means the joint Federal and title IV-E agency review of all federally-assisted child and family services programs, including family preservation and support services, child protective services, foster care, adoption, and independent living services, for the purpose of determining the title IV-E agency's substantial conformity with the plan requirements of titles IV-B and IV-E as listed in § 1355.34 of this part. A full review consists of two phases, the statewide assessment (or for a Tribal title IV-E agency, an assessment of the service area) and a subsequent on-site review, as described in § 1355.33 of this part.

      means a judicially-created relationship between child and caretaker which is intended to be permanent and self-sustaining as evidenced by the transfer to the caretaker of the following parental rights with respect to the child: protection, education, care and control of the person, custody of the person, and decision-making. The term  means the caretaker in such a relationship.

      means the voluntary national data collection and analysis system established by the Administration for Children and Families in response to a requirement in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (Pub. L. 93-247), as amended.

      means:

      (1) For the purpose of the child and family services review, the joint Federal and State/Tribal review of one or more federally-assisted child and family services program(s), including family preservation and support services, child protective services, foster care, adoption, and independent living services. A partial review may consist of any of the components of the full review, as mutually agreed upon by the title IV-E agency and the Administration for Children and Families as being sufficient to determine substantial conformity of the reviewed components with the plan requirements of titles IV-B and IV-E as listed in § 1355.34 of this part;

      (2) For the purpose of title IV-B and title IV-E State plan compliance issues that are outside the prescribed child and family services review format, e.g., compliance with AFCARS requirements, a review of State laws, policies, regulations, or other information appropriate to the nature of the concern, to determine State compliance; or

      (3) For the purpose of title IV-E plan compliance issues for a Tribal title IV-E agency which are outside of the prescribed child and family services review format, a review of Tribal laws, policies, regulations, or other information appropriate to the nature of the concern, to determine plan compliance.

      means:

      (1) The hearing required by section 475(5)(C) of the Act to determine the permanency plan for a child in foster care. Within this context, the court (including a Tribal court) or administrative body determines whether and, if applicable, when the child will be:

      (i) Returned to the parent;

      (ii) Placed for adoption, with the title IV-E agency filing a petition for termination of parental rights;

      (iii) Referred for legal guardianship;

      (iv) Placed permanently with a fit and willing relative; or

      (v) Placed in another planned permanent living arrangement, but only in cases where the title IV-E agency has documented to the State or Tribal court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child to follow one of the four specified options above.

      (2) The permanency hearing must be held no later than 12 months after the date the child is considered to have entered foster care in accordance with the definition at § 1355.20 of this part or within 30 days of a judicial determination that reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family are not required. After the initial permanency hearing, subsequent permanency hearings must be held not less frequently than every 12 months during the continuation of foster care. The permanency hearing must be conducted by a family or juvenile court or another court of competent jurisdiction or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court which is not a part of or under the supervision or direction of the title IV-E agency. Paper reviews,  hearings, agreed orders, or other actions or hearings which are not open to the participation of the parents of the child, the child (if of appropriate age), and foster parents or preadoptive parents (if any) are not permanency hearings.

      means, for title IV-B, the 50 _State_s, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. For title IV-E the term “State” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.

      means the _State agency_ administering or supervising the administration of the title IV-B and title IV-E State plans and the title XX social services block grant program. An exception to this requirement is permitted by section 103(d) of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-272). Section 103(d) provides that, if on December 1, 1974, the title IV-B program (in a State or local agency) and the social services program under section 402(a)(3) of the Act (the predecessor program to title XX) were administered by separate agencies, that separate administration of the programs could continue at State option.

      means the initial phase of a full review of all federally-assisted child and family services programs in the States (or for a Tribal title IV-E agency, in the service area), including family preservation and support services, child protective services, foster care, adoption, and independent living services as described in § 1355.33(b) of this part, for the purpose of determining substantial conformity with the plan requirements of titles IV-B and IV-E as listed in § 1355.34 of this part.

      means the State or Tribal agency administering or supervising the administration of the title IV-B and title IV-E plans.

      means, for the purpose of title IV-E, the agency of the Indian Tribe, Indian Tribal organization (as those terms are defined in section 479B(a) of the Act) or consortium of Indian Tribes that is administering or supervising the administration of the title IV-E and title IV-B, subpart 1 plan.

      (b) Unless otherwise specified, the definitions contained in section 475 of the Act apply to all programs under titles IV-E and IV-B of the Act.

      § 1355.22   Designated Placement requirements under titles IV-E and IV-B for LGBTQI+ children.

#### § § 1355.22

      LGBTQI+ children (including children with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning, and intersex status or identity) shall be placed and receive services in accordance with the following requirements:

      (a)  As part of meeting the requirement to provide a safe and appropriate placement for all children in foster care, the title IV-E/IV-B agency must ensure that all placements, including those for LGBTQI+ children, are free from harassment, mistreatment, or abuse.

      (b)  The title IV-E/IV-B agency must meet the following requirements for each LGBTQI+ child in foster care:

      (1)  The title IV-E/IV-B agency must ensure there is a Designated Placement available for all LGBTQI+ children in foster care who request or would benefit from such a placement. Nothing in this section requires any provider to become or serve as a Designated Placement. As used in this section, for a placement to be specifically designated for an LGBTQI+ child, the provider must meet the protections generally applicable as defined at paragraph (a) of this section and:

      (i) Commit to establish an environment that supports the child's LGBTQI+ status or identity;

      (ii) Be trained with the appropriate knowledge and skills to provide for the needs of the child related to the child's self-identified sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The training must reflect evidence, studies, and research about the impacts of rejection, discrimination, and stigma on the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ children, and provide information for providers about professional standards and recommended practices that promote the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ children; and

      (iii) Facilitate the child's access to age- or developmentally appropriate resources, services, and activities that support their health and well-being as described in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (2)  The IV-E/IV-B agency must implement a process by which an LGBTQI+ child may request a Designated Placement as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or request that their current placement be offered services to become a Designated Placement. The title IV-E/IV-B agency's process for considering such a request must provide the child with an opportunity to express their needs and concerns. The process must safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of the child, consistent with section 471(a)(8) of the Act and 45 CFR 205.50, and must include the following components:

      (i) Notice of the availability of Designated Placements and the ability to request that services be offered to their current placement must be provided to, at minimum:

      (A) All children age 14 and over; and

      (B) Children under age 14 who:

      () Have been removed from their home due, in whole or part, to familial conflict about their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics; or

      () Have disclosed their LGBTQI+ status or identity or whose LGBTQI+ status or identity is otherwise known to the agency;

      (ii) The notice must be provided in an age- or developmentally appropriate manner, both verbally and in writing, and must inform the child of how they may request a Designated Placement or services for their current placement and the process the title IV-E/IV-B agency will use in responding to their request; and

      (iii) The notice must inform the child of the nonretaliation protections described at paragraph (d) of this section and describe the process by which a child may report a concern about retaliation.

      (3)  When making placement and service decisions related to an LGBTQI+ child, the title IV-E/IV-B agency shall give substantial weight to the child's expressed concerns or requests when determining the child's best interests. To promote placement stability, when an LGBTQI+ child requests a Designated Placement and before initiating any placement changes, the title IV-E/IV-B agency must consider whether additional services and training would allow the current provider to meet the conditions for a Designated Placement. If so, and if the current provider is willing to meet the conditions for a Designated Placement, the IV-E/IV-B agency must use the case review system to regularly review the provider's progress towards meeting the conditions of such a designation.

      (c)  The title IV-E/IV-B agency must implement a process for LGBTQI+ children to report concerns about a placement that fails to meet the applicable requirements of this section, and to report concerns about retaliation as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The process must safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of the child, consistent with section 471(a)(8) of the Act and 45 CFR 205.50. The title IV-E/IV-B agency must respond promptly to an LGBTQI+ child's reported concern, consistent with the agency's timeframes for investigating child abuse and neglect reports depending on the nature of the child's report.

      (d)  (1) The title IV-E/IV-B agency must have a procedure to ensure that neither the title IV-E/IV-B agency, nor any provider, nor any entity or person acting on behalf of the agency or a provider retaliates against an LGBTQI+ child in foster care based on the child's actual or perceived LGBTQI+ status or identity, any disclosure of that status or identity by the child or a third party, or the child's request or report related to the requirements for placements or services under this part.

      (2) Conduct by the title IV-E/IV-B agency, provider, or any entity or person acting on behalf of the agency or a provider that will be considered retaliation includes, but is not limited to:

      (i) Harassment, mistreatment, or abuse as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii) Attempts to undermine, suppress, change, or stigmatize a child's sexual orientation or gender identity or expression through “conversion therapy.”

      (iii) Unwarranted placement changes, including unwarranted placements in congregate care facilities, or restricting an LGBTQI+ child's access to LGBTQI+ peers, siblings, family members, or age- or developmentally appropriate materials and community resources.

      (iv) Disclosing the child's LGBTQI+ status or identity in ways that cause harm or risk the privacy of the child or that infringe on any privacy rights of the child.

      (v) Using information about the child's LGBTQI+ status or identity to initiate or sustain a child protection investigation or disclosing information about the child's LGBTQI+ status or identity to law enforcement in any manner not permitted by law.

      (vi) Taking action against current or potential caregivers (including foster parents, pre-adoptive parents, adoptive parents, kin caregivers and birth families) because they support or have supported a child's LGBTQI+ status or identity.

      (e)  The title IV-E/IV-B agency must ensure that LGBTQI+ children have access to age- or developmentally appropriate services that are supportive of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, including clinically appropriate mental and behavioral health supports.

      (f)  When considering placing a child, the title IV-E/IV-B agency must offer the child a placement consistent with their gender identity. The title IV-E/IV-B agency must also consult with the child to provide an opportunity to voice any concerns related to placement.

      (g)  The title IV-E/IV-B agency must comply with all applicable privacy laws, including section 471(a)(8) of the Act and 45 CFR 205.50, in all aspects of its implementation of this section. Information that reveals a child's LGBTQI+ status or identity may only be disclosed in accordance with law and any such disclosure must be the minimum necessary to accomplish the legally-permitted purposes.

      (h)  In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the title IV-E-/IV-B agency must:

      (1) Ensure that its employees who have responsibility for placing children in foster care, making placement decisions, or providing services:

      (i) Are trained to implement the procedural requirements of this section; and

      (ii) Are adequately prepared with the appropriate knowledge and skills to serve an LGBTQI+ child related to their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.

      (2) Ensure that all its contractors and subrecipients who have responsibility for placing children in foster care, making placement decisions, or providing services are informed of the procedural requirements to comply with this section, including the required non-retaliation provisions outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (3) Ensure that all placement providers are informed of the procedural requirements to comply with this section, including the required non-retaliation provision outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (i)  Insofar as the application of any requirement under this section would violate applicable Federal protections for religious freedom, conscience, and free speech, such application shall not be required.

      (j)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or authorize a State or Tribe to penalize a provider in the titles IV-E or IV-B programs because the provider does not seek or is determined not to qualify as a Designated Placement under this section.

      (k)  Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision of this section is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this section and shall not affect the remainder thereof.

      (l)  Title IV-E/IV-B agencies must follow the requirements of this section beginning on October 1, 2026.

      (m)  Nothing in this section shall limit any State, Tribe, or local government from imposing or enforcing, as a matter of law or policy, requirements that provide greater protection to LGBTQI+ children than this section provides.

      § 1355.25   Principles of child and family services.

#### § § 1355.25

      The following principles, most often identified by practitioners and others as helping to assure effective services for children, youth, and families, should guide the States and Indian Tribes in developing, operating, and improving the continuum of child and family services.

      (a) The safety and well-being of children and of all family members is paramount. When safety can be assured, strengthening and preserving families is seen as the best way to promote the healthy development of children. One important way to keep children safe is to stop violence in the family including violence against their mothers.

      (b) Services are focused on the family as a whole; service providers work with families as partners in identifying and meeting individual and family needs; family strengths are identified, enhanced, respected, and mobilized to help families solve the problems which compromise their functioning and well-being.

      (c) Services promote the healthy development of children and youth, promote permanency for all children and help prepare youth emancipating from the foster care system for self-sufficiency and independent living.

      (d) Services may focus on prevention, protection, or other short or long-term interventions to meet the needs of the family and the best interests and need of the individual(s) who may be placed in out-of-home care.

      (e) Services are timely, flexible, coordinated, and accessible to families and individuals, principally delivered in the home or the community, and are delivered in a manner that is respectful of and builds on the strengths of the community and cultural groups.

      (f) Services are organized as a continuum, designed to achieve measurable outcomes, and are linked to a wide variety of supports and services which can be crucial to meeting families' and children's needs, for example, housing, substance abuse treatment, mental health, health, education, job training, child care, and informal support networks.

      (g) Most child and family services are community-based, involve community organizations, parents and residents in their design and delivery, and are accountable to the community and the client's needs.

      (h) Services are intensive enough and of sufficient duration to keep children safe and meet family needs. The actual level of intensity and length of time needed to ensure safety and assist the family may vary greatly between preventive (family support) and crisis intervention services (family preservation), based on the changing needs of children and families at various times in their lives. A family or an individual does not need to be in crisis in order to receive services.

      Sections 1355.32 through 1355.37 of this part apply to reviews of child and family services programs under subparts 1 and 2 of title IV-B of the Act, and reviews of foster care and adoption assistance programs under title IV-E of the Act.

> [77 FR 926, Jan. 6, 2012]

      § 1355.32   Timetable for the reviews.

#### § § 1355.32

      (a)  Each State must complete an initial full review as described in § 1355.33 of this part during the four-year period after the final rule becomes effective. Each Tribal title IV-E agency must complete an initial full review as described in § 1355.33 of this part, during the four-year period after the ACF determines that the Tribe has approved title IV-B, subpart 1 and 2 and title IV-E plans and has sufficient cases for ACF to apply the procedures in § 1355.33(c).

      (b)  (1) A title IV-E agency found to be operating in substantial conformity during an initial or subsequent review, as defined in § 1355.34 of this part, must:

      (i) Complete a full review every five years; and

      (ii) Submit a completed statewide assessment, or in the case of a Tribal title IV-E agency, a completed Tribal assessment of the service area, to ACF three years after the on-site review. The assessment will be reviewed jointly by the title IV-E agency and ACF to determine the State's or Indian Tribe's continuing substantial conformity with the plan requirements subject to review. No formal approval of this interim assessment by ACF is required.

      (2) A program found not to be operating in substantial conformity during an initial or subsequent review will:

      (i) Be required to develop and implement a program improvement plan, as defined in § 1355.35 of this part; and

      (ii) Begin a full review two years after approval of the program improvement plan.

      (c)  (1) ACF may require a full or a partial review at any time, based on any information, regardless of the source, that indicates the title IV-E agency may no longer be operating in substantial conformity.

      (2) Prior to reinstating a full or partial review, ACF will conduct an inquiry and require the title IV-E agency to submit additional data whenever ACF receives information that the title IV-E agency may not be in substantial conformity.

      (3) If the additional information and inquiry indicates to ACF's satisfaction that the title IV-E agency is operating in substantial conformity, ACF will not proceed with any further review of the issue addressed by the inquiry. This inquiry will not substitute for the full reviews conducted by ACF under § 1355.32(b).

      (4) ACF may proceed with a full or partial review if the title IV-E agency does not provide the additional information as requested, or the additional information confirms that the title IV-E agency may not be operating in substantial conformity.

      (d)  When ACF becomes aware of a title IV-B or title IV-E compliance issue that is outside the scope of the child and family services review process, we will:

      (1) Conduct an inquiry and require the title IV-E agency to submit additional data.

      (2) If the additional information and inquiry indicates to ACF's satisfaction that the title IV-E agency is in compliance, we will not proceed with any further review of the issue addressed by the inquiry.

      (3) ACF will institute a partial review, appropriate to the nature of the concern, if the title IV-E agency does not provide the additional information as requested, or the additional information confirms that the title IV-E agency may not be in compliance.

      (4) If the partial review determines that the title IV-E agency is not in compliance with the applicable plan requirement, the title IV-E agency must enter into a program improvement plan designed to bring the title IV-E agency into compliance, if the provisions for such a plan are applicable. The terms, action steps and time-frames of the program improvement plan will be developed on a case-by-case basis by ACF and the title IV-E agency. The program improvement plan must take into consideration the extent of noncompliance and the impact of the noncompliance on the safety, permanency or well-being of children and families served through the title IV-E agency's title IV-B or IV-E allocation. If the title IV-E agency remains out of compliance, the title IV-E agency will be subject to a penalty related to the extent of the noncompliance.

      § 1355.33   Procedures for the review.

#### § § 1355.33

      (a) The full child and family services reviews will:

      (1) Consist of a two-phase process that includes a statewide assessment and an on-site review; and

      (2) Be conducted by a team of Federal, and State or Tribal reviewers that includes:

      (i) Staff of the child and family services agency, including the offices that represent the service areas that are the focus of any particular review;

      (ii) Representatives selected by the title IV-E agency, in collaboration with the ACF Regional Office, from those with whom the title IV-E agency was required to consult in developing its CFSP, as described and required in 45 CFR 1357.15(l);

      (iii) Federal staff of HHS; and

      (iv) Other individuals, as deemed appropriate and agreed upon by the title IV-E agency and ACF.

      (b)  The first phase of the full review will be a statewide assessment, or for a Tribal title IV-E agency a service area assessment, conducted by the title IV-E agency's internal and external members of the review team. The assessment must:

      (1) Address each systemic factor under review including the statewide/Tribal information system; case review system; quality assurance system; staff training; service array; agency responsiveness to the community; and foster and adoptive parent licensing, recruitment and retention;

      (2) Assess the outcome areas of safety, permanence, and well-being of children and families served by the title IV-E agency using data from AFCARS and NCANDS. For the initial review, ACF may approve another data source to substitute for AFCARS, and in all reviews, ACF may approve another data source to substitute for NCANDS. The title IV-E agency must also analyze and explain its performance in meeting the national standards for the statewide/Tribal service area data indicators;

      (3) Assess the characteristics of the title IV-E agency that have the most significant impact on the agency's capacity to deliver services to children and families that will lead to improved outcomes;

      (4) Assess the strengths and areas of the title IV-E agency's child and family services programs that require further examination through an on-site review;

      (5) Include a listing of all the persons external to the title IV-E agency who participated in the preparation of the assessment pursuant to § 1355.33(a)(2)(ii) and (iv); and

      (6) Be completed and submitted to ACF within 4 months of the date that ACF transmits the information for the assessment to the title IV-E agency.

      (c)  The second phase of the full review will be an on-site review.

      (1) The on-site review will cover the title IV-E agency's programs under titles IV-B and IV-E of the Act, including in-home services and foster care. It will be jointly planned by the title IV-E agency and ACF, and guided by information in the completed assessment that identifies areas in need of improvement or further review.

      (2) The on-site review may be concentrated in several specific political subdivisions or jurisdictions of the title IV-E agency, as agreed upon by the ACF and the title IV-E agency; however, for a State title IV-E agency, a State's largest metropolitan subdivision must be one of the locations selected.

      (3) ACF has final approval of the selection of specific areas of the title IV-E agency's child and family services continuum described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and selection of the political subdivisions or jurisdiction referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (4) Sources of information collected during the on-site review to determine substantial conformity must include, but are not limited to:

      (i) Case records on children and families served by the agency;

      (ii) Interviews with children and families whose case records have been reviewed and who are, or have been, recipients of services of the agency;

      (iii) Interviews with caseworkers, foster parents, and service providers for the cases selected for the on-site review; and

      (iv) Interviews with key stakeholders, both internal and external to the agency, which, at a minimum, must include those individuals who participated in the development of the State's or Tribal title IV-E agency's CFSP required at 45 CFR 1357.15(1), courts, administrative review bodies, children's guardians ad litem and other individuals or bodies assigned responsibility for representing the best interests of the child.

      (5) The sample will range from 30-50 cases. Foster care cases must be drawn randomly from AFCARS, or, for the initial review, from another source approved by ACF and include children who entered foster care during the year under review. In-home cases must be drawn randomly from NCANDS or from another source approved by ACF. To ensure that all program areas are adequately represented, the sample size may be increased.

      (6) The sample of 30-50 cases reviewed on-site will be selected from a randomly drawn oversample of no more than 150 foster care and 150 in-home services cases. The oversample must be statistically significant at a 90 percent compliance rate (95 percent in subsequent reviews), with a tolerable sampling error of 5 percent and a confidence coefficient of 95 percent. The additional cases in the oversample not selected for the on-site review will form the sample of cases to be reviewed, if needed, in order to resolve discrepancies between the statewide/Tribal assessment and the on-site review in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (d)  Discrepancies between the statewide or Tribal assessment and the findings of the on-site portion of the review will be resolved by either of the following means, at the title IV-E agency's option:

      (1) The submission of additional information by the title IV-E agency; or

      (2) ACF and the title IV-E agency will review additional cases using only those indicators in which the discrepancy occurred. ACF and the title IV-E agency will determine jointly the number of additional cases to be reviewed, not to exceed 150 foster care cases or 150 in-home services cases to be selected as specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.

      (e)  A partial child and family services review, when required, will be planned and conducted jointly by ACF and the title IV-E agency based on the nature of the concern. A partial review does not substitute for the full reviews as required under § 1355.32(b).

      (f)  Within 30 calendar days following either a partial child and family services review, full child and family services review, or the resolution of a discrepancy between the assessment and the findings of the on-site portion of the review, ACF will notify the title IV-E agency in writing of whether the title IV-E agency is, or is not, operating in substantial conformity.

      § 1355.34   Criteria for determining substantial conformity.

#### § § 1355.34

      (a)  ACF will determine a title IV-E agency's substantial conformity with title IV-B and title IV-E plan requirements based on the following:

      (1) Its ability to meet national standards, set by the Secretary, for the statewide/Tribal service area data indicators associated with specific outcomes for children and families;

      (2) Its ability to meet criteria related to outcomes for children and families; and

      (3) Its ability to meet criteria related to the title IV-E agency's capacity to deliver services leading to improved outcomes.

      (b)  (1) A title IV-E agency's substantial conformity will be determined by its ability to substantially achieve the following child and family service outcomes:

      (i)

      (A) Children are, first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect; and,

      (B) Children are safely maintained in their own homes whenever possible and appropriate;

      (ii)

      (A) Children have permanency and stability in their living situations; and

      (B) The continuity of family relationships and connections is preserved for children; and

      (iii)

      (A) Families have enhanced capacity to provide for their children's needs;

      (B) Children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs; and

      (C) Children receive adequate services to meet their physical and mental health needs.

      (2) A title IV-E agency's level of achievement with regard to each outcome reflects the extent to which a title IV-E agency has:

      (i) Met the national standard(s) for the statewide/Tribal service area data indicator(s) associated with that outcome, if applicable; and,

      (ii) Implemented the following CFSP requirements or assurances:

      (A) The requirements in 45 CFR 1357.15(p) regarding services designed to assure the safety and protection of children and the preservation and support of families;

      (B) The requirements in 45 CFR 1357.15(q) regarding the permanency provisions for children and families in sections 422 and 471 of the Act;

      (C) The requirements in section 422(b)(7) of the Act regarding recruitment of potential foster and adoptive families;

      (D) The assurances as required by section 422(b)(8)(B) of the Act regarding policies and procedures for abandoned children;

      (E) The requirements in section 422(b)(9) of the Act regarding the State's compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act;

      (F) The requirements in section 422(b)(10) of the Act regarding a title IV-E agency's plan for effective use of cross-jurisdictional resources to facilitate timely adoptive or permanent placements; and,

      (G) The requirements in section 471(a)(15) of the Act regarding reasonable efforts to prevent removals of children from their homes, to make it possible for children in foster care to safely return to their homes, or, when the child is not able to return home, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan and complete the steps necessary to finalize the permanent placement.

      (3) A title IV-E agency will be determined to be in substantial conformity if its performance on:

      (i) Each statewide/Tribal service area data indicator developed pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section meets the national standard described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and,

      (ii) Each outcome listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is rated as “substantially achieved” in 95 percent of the cases examined during the on-site review (90 percent of the cases for an initial review). Information from various sources (case records, interviews) will be examined for each outcome and a determination made as to the degree to which each outcome has been achieved for each case reviewed.

      (4) The Secretary may, using AFCARS and NCANDS, develop statewide/Tribal service area data indicators for each of the specific outcomes described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for use in determining substantial conformity. The Secretary may add, amend, or suspend any such statewide/Tribal service area data indicator(s) when appropriate. To the extent practical and feasible, the statewide/Tribal service area data indicators will be consistent with those developed in accordance with section 203 of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-89).

      (5) The initial national standards for the statewide data indicators described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section will be based on the 75th percentile of all State performance for that indicator, as reported in AFCARS or NCANDS. The Secretary may adjust these national standards if appropriate. The initial national standard will be set using the following data sources:

      (i) The 1997 and 1998 submissions to NCANDS (or the most recent and complete 2 years available), for those statewide data indicators associated with the safety outcomes; and,

      (ii) The 1998b, 1999c, and 2000a submissions to AFCARS (or the most recent and complete report periods available), for those statewide data indicators associated with the permanency outcomes.

      (c)  In addition to the criteria related to outcomes contained in paragraph (b) of this section, the title IV-E agency also must satisfy criteria related to the delivery of services. Based on information from the assessment and onsite review, the title IV-E agency must meet the following criteria for each systemic factor in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(7) of this section to be considered in substantial conformity: All of the plan requirements associated with the systemic factor must be in place, and no more than one of the plan requirements fails to function as described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(7) of this section. The systemic factor in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is rated on the basis of only one plan requirement. To be considered in substantial conformity, the plan requirement associated with statewide/Tribal information system capacity must be both in place and functioning as described in the requirement. ACF will use a rating scale to make the determinations of substantial conformity. The systemic factors under review are:

      (1)  The State/Tribal title IV-E agency is operating a statewide/Tribal information system that, at a minimum, can readily identify the status, demographic characteristics, location, and goals for the placement of every child who is (or within the immediately preceding 12 months, has been) in foster care (section (422)(b)(8)(A)(i) of the Act);

      (2)  The title IV-E agency has procedures in place that:

      (i) Provide, for each child, a written case plan to be developed jointly with the child's parent(s) that includes provisions: for placing the child in the least restrictive, most family-like placement appropriate to the child's needs, and in close proximity to the parents' home where such placement is in the child's best interests; for visits with a child placed out of State/Tribal service area at least every 12 months by a caseworker of the agency or of the agency in the State/Tribal service area where the child is placed; for documentation of the steps taken to make and finalize an adoptive or other permanent placement when the child cannot return home; and for implementation of the requirements of § 1355.22(b) and (d) as applicable (sections 422(b)(8)(A)(ii), 471(a)(16), and 475(5)(A) of the Act and § 1355.22(b) and (d));

      (ii) Provide for periodic review of the status of each child no less frequently than once every six months by either a court or by administrative review (sections 422(b)(8)(A)(ii), 471(a)(16) and 475(5)(B) of the Act);

      (iii) Assure that each child in foster care under the supervision of the title IV-E agency has a permanency hearing in a family or juvenile court or another court of competent jurisdiction (including a Tribal court), or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, which is not a part of or under the supervision or direction of the title IV-E agency, no later than 12 months from the date the child entered foster care (and not less frequently than every 12 months thereafter during the continuation of foster care) (sections 422(b)(8)(A)(ii), 471(a)(16) and 475(5)(C) of the Act);

      (iv) Provide a process for termination of parental rights proceedings in accordance with sections 422(b)(8)(A)(ii), 475(5)(E) and (F) of the Act; and,

      (v) Provide foster parents, preadoptive parents, and relative caregivers of children in foster care with notice of and a right to be heard in permanency hearings and six-month periodic reviews held with respect to the child (sections 422(b)(8)(A)(ii), 475(5)(G) of the Act, and 45 CFR 1356.21(o)).

      (3)  The title IV-E agency has developed and implemented standards to ensure that children in foster care placements are provided quality services that protect the safety and health of the children (section 471(a)(22)) and is operating an identifiable quality assurance system (45 CFR 1357.15(u)) as described in the CFSP that:

      (i) Is in place in the jurisdictions within the State/Tribal service area where services included in the CFSP are provided;

      (ii) Is able to evaluate the adequacy and quality of services provided under the CFSP;

      (iii) Is able to identify the strengths and needs of the service delivery system it evaluates;

      (iv) Provides reports to agency administrators on the quality of services evaluated and needs for improvement; and

      (v) Evaluates measures implemented to address identified problems.

      (4)  The title IV-E agency is operating a staff development and training program (45 CFR 1357.15(t)) that:

      (i) Supports the goals and objectives in the title IV-E agency's CFSP;

      (ii) Addresses services provided under both subparts of title IV-B and the training plan under title IV-E of the Act;

      (iii) Provides training for all staff who provide family preservation and support services, child protective services, foster care services, adoption services and independent living services soon after they are employed and that includes the basic skills and knowledge required for their positions;

      (iv) Provides ongoing training for staff that addresses the skills and knowledge base needed to carry out their duties with regard to the services included in the CFSP; and,

      (v) Provides training for current or prospective foster parents, adoptive parents, and the staff of State/Tribal-licensed or State/Tribal-approved child care institutions providing care to foster and adopted children receiving assistance under title IV-E that addresses the skills and knowledge base needed to carry out their duties with regard to caring for foster and adopted children.

      (5)  Information from the assessment and on-site review determines that the title IV-E agency has in place an array of services (45 CFR 1357.15(n) and section 422(b)(8)(A)(iii) and (iv) of the Act) that includes, at a minimum:

      (i) Services that assess the strengths and needs of children and families assisted by the agency and are used to determine other service needs;

      (ii) Services that address the needs of the family, as well as the individual child, in order to create a safe home environment;

      (iii) Services designed to enable children at risk of foster care placement to remain with their families when their safety and well-being can be reasonably assured;

      (iv) Services designed to help children achieve permanency by returning to families from which they have been removed, where appropriate, be placed for adoption or with a legal guardian or in some other planned, permanent living arrangement, and through post-legal adoption services;

      (v) Services that are accessible to families and children in all political subdivisions and/or the entire service area covered in the CFSP; and,

      (vi) Services that can be individualized to meet the unique needs of children and families served by the agency.

      (6)

      (i) The title IV-E agency, in implementing the provisions of the CFSP, engages in ongoing consultation with a broad array of individuals and organizations representing the State/Tribal and county/local agencies responsible for implementing the CFSP and other major stakeholders in the services delivery system including, at a minimum, Tribal representatives, consumers, service providers, foster care providers, the juvenile court, and other public and private child and family serving agencies (45 CFR 1357.15(l)(3));

      (ii) The agency develops, in consultation with these or similar representatives, annual reports of progress and services delivered pursuant to the CFSP (45 CFR 1357.16(a));

      (iii) There is evidence that the agency's goals and objectives included in the CFSP reflect consideration of the major concerns of stakeholders consulted in developing the plan and on an ongoing basis (45 CFR 1357.15(m)); and

      (iv) There is evidence that the services under the plan are coordinated with services or benefits under other Federal or federally-assisted programs serving the same populations to achieve the goals and objectives in the plan (45 CFR 1357.15(m)).

      (7)

      (i) The State or Tribe has established and maintains standards for foster family homes and child care institutions which are reasonably in accord with recommended standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such institutions or homes (section 471(a)(10) of the Act);

      (ii) The standards so established are applied by the State or Tribe to every licensed or approved foster family home or child care institution receiving funds under title IV-E or IV-B of the Act (section 471(a)(10) of the Act);

      (iii) The title IV-E agency complies with the safety requirements for foster care and adoptive placements in accordance with sections 471(a)(16), 471(a)(20) and 475(1) of the Act and 45 CFR 1356.30;

      (iv) The title IV-E agency has in place an identifiable process for assuring the diligent recruitment of potential foster and adoptive families that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of children in the State or Tribe for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed (section 422(b)(7) of the Act); and,

      (v) The title IV-E agency has developed and implemented plans for the effective use of cross-jurisdictional resources to facilitate timely adoptive or permanent placements for waiting children (section 422(b)(10) of the Act).

      (d)  ACF will make available to the title IV-E agencies copies of the review instruments, which will contain the specific standards to be used to determine substantial conformity, on an ongoing basis, whenever significant revisions to the instruments are made.

      § 1355.35   Program improvement plans.

#### § § 1355.35

      (a)  (1) Title IV-E agencies found not to be operating in substantial conformity shall develop a program improvement plan. The program improvement plan must:

      (i) Be developed jointly by title IV-E agency and Federal staff in consultation with the review team;

      (ii) Identify the areas in which the title IV-E agency's program is not in substantial conformity;

      (iii) Set forth the goals, the action steps required to correct each identified weakness or deficiency, and dates by which each action step is to be completed in order to improve the specific areas;

      (iv) Set forth the amount of progress the statewide/Tribal data will make toward meeting the national standards;

      (v) Establish benchmarks that will be used to measure the title IV-E agency's progress in implementing the program improvement plan and describe the methods that will be used to evaluate progress;

      (vi) Identify how the action steps in the plan build on and make progress over prior program improvement plans;

      (vii) Identify the technical assistance needs and sources of technical assistance, both Federal and non-Federal, which will be used to make the necessary improvements identified in the program improvement plan.

      (2) In the event that ACF and the title IV-E agency cannot reach consensus regarding the content of a program improvement plan or the degree of program or data improvement to be achieved, ACF retains the final authority to assign the contents of the plan and/or the degree of improvement required for successful completion of the plan. Under such circumstances, ACF will render a written rationale for assigning such content or degree of improvement.

      (b)  Title IV-E agencies found to be operating in substantial conformity may voluntarily develop and implement a program improvement plan in collaboration with the ACF Regional Office, under the following circumstances:

      (1) The title IV-E agency and Regional Office agree that there are areas of the title IV-E agency's child and family services programs in need of improvement which can be addressed through the development and implementation of a voluntary program improvement plan;

      (2) ACF approval of the voluntary program improvement plan will not be required; and

      (3) No penalty will be assessed for the title IV-E agency's failure to achieve the goals described in the voluntary program improvement plan.

      (c)  (1) A title IV-E agency determined not to be in substantial conformity must submit a program improvement plan to ACF for approval within 90 calendar days from the date the title IV-E agency receives the written notification from ACF that it is not operating in substantial conformity.

      (2) Any program improvement plan will be approved by ACF if it meets the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

      (3) If the program improvement plan does not meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the title IV-E agency will have 30 calendar days from the date it receives notice from ACF that the plan has not been approved to revise and resubmit the plan for approval.

      (4) If the title IV-E agency does not submit a revised program improvement plan according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section or if the plan does not meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, withholding of funds pursuant to the provisions of § 1355.36 of this part will begin.

      (d)  (1) ACF retains the authority to establish time frames for the program improvement plan consistent with the seriousness and complexity of the remedies required for any areas determined not in substantial conformity, not to exceed two years.

      (2) Particularly egregious areas of nonconformity impacting child safety must receive priority in both the content and time frames of the program improvement plans and must be addressed in less than two years.

      (3) The Secretary may approve extensions of deadlines in a program improvement plan not to exceed one year. The circumstances under which requests for extensions will be approved are expected to be rare. The title IV-E agency must provide compelling documentation of the need for such an extension. Requests for extensions must be received by ACF at least 60 days prior to the affected completion date.

      (4) Title IV-E agencies must provide quarterly status reports (unless ACF and the title IV-E agency agree to less frequent reports) to ACF. Such reports must inform ACF of progress in implementing the measures of the plan.

      (e)  Program improvement plans will be evaluated jointly by the title IV-E agency and ACF, in collaboration with other members of the review team, as described in the title IV-E agency's program improvement plan and in accordance with the following criteria:

      (1) The methods and information used to measure progress must be sufficient to determine when and whether the title IV-E agency is operating in substantial conformity or has reached the negotiated standard with respect to statewide/Tribal service area data indicators that failed to meet the national standard for that indicator;

      (2) The frequency of evaluating progress will be determined jointly by the title IV-E agency and Federal team members, but no less than annually. Evaluation of progress will be performed in conjunction with the annual updates of the title IV-E agency's CFSP, as described in paragraph (f) of this section;

      (3) Action steps may be jointly determined by the title IV-E agency and ACF to be achieved prior to projected completion dates, and will not require any further evaluation at a later date; and

      (4) The title IV-E agency and ACF may jointly renegotiate the terms and conditions of the program improvement plan as needed, provided that:

      (i) The renegotiated plan is designed to correct the areas of the title IV-E agency's program determined not to be in substantial conformity and/or achieve a standard for the statewide/Tribal service area data indicators that is acceptable to ACF;

      (ii) The amount of time needed to implement the provisions of the plan does not extend beyond three years from the date the original program improvement plan was approved;

      (iii) The terms of the renegotiated plan are approved by ACF; and

      (iv) The Secretary approves any extensions beyond the two-year limit.

      (f)  The elements of the program improvement plan must be incorporated into the goals and objectives of the title IV-E agency's CFSP. Progress in implementing the program improvement plan must be included in the annual reviews and progress reports related to the CFSP required in 45 CFR 1357.16.

> [65 FR 4080, Jan. 25, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 58675, Nov. 23, 2001; 77 FR 929, Jan. 6, 2012]

      § 1355.36   Withholding Federal funds due to failure to achieve substantial conformity or failure to successfully complete a program improvement plan.

#### § § 1355.36

      (a)

      (1) The term “title IV-B funds” refers to the title IV-E agency's combined allocation of title IV-B subpart 1 and subpart 2 funds; and

      (2) The term “title IV-E funds” refers to the title IV-E agency's reimbursement for administrative costs for the foster care program under title IV-E.

      (b)  ACF will determine the amount of title IV-B and IV-E funds to be withheld due to a finding that the title IV-E agency is not operating in substantial conformity, as follows:

      (1) A title IV-E agency will have the opportunity to develop and complete a program improvement plan prior to any withholding of funds.

      (2) Title IV-B and IV-E funds will not be withheld from a title IV-E agency if the determination of nonconformity was caused by the title IV-E agency's correct use of formal written statements of Federal law or policy provided the title IV-E agency by DHHS.

      (3) A portion of the title IV-E agency's title IV-B and IV-E funds will be withheld by ACF for the year under review and for each succeeding year until the title IV-E agency either successfully completes a program improvement plan or is found to be operating in substantial conformity.

      (4) The amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds subject to withholding due to a determination that a title IV-E agency is not operating in substantial conformity is based on a pool of funds defined as follows:

      (i) The title IV-E agency's allotment of title IV-B funds for each of the years to which the withholding applies; and

      (ii) An amount equivalent to 10 percent of the title IV-E agency's Federal claims for title IV-E foster care administrative costs for each of the years to which withholding applies;

      (5) The amount of funds to be withheld from the pool in paragraph (b)(4) of this section will be computed as follows:

      (i) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section, an amount equivalent to one percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each of the years to which withholding applies will be withheld for each of the seven outcomes listed in § 1355.34(b)(1) of this part that is determined not to be in substantial conformity; and

      (ii) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section, an amount equivalent to one percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each of the years to which withholding applies will be withheld for each of the seven systemic factors listed in § 1355.34(c) of this part that is determined not to be in substantial conformity.

      (6) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7), (b)(8), and (e)(4) of this section, in the event the title IV-E agency is determined to be in nonconformity on each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors subject to review, the maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply is 14 percent per year of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year.

      (7) Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to correct the areas of nonconformity through the successful completion of a program improvement plan, and are determined to be in nonconformity on the second full review following the first full review in which a determination of nonconformity was made will be subject to increased withholding as follows:

      (i) The amount of funds described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will increase to two percent for each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors that continues in nonconformity since the immediately preceding child and family services review;

      (ii) The increased withholding of funds for areas of continuous nonconformity is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section;

      (iii) The maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply on the second full review following the first full review in which the determination of nonconformity was made is 28 percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year to which the withholding of funds applies.

      (8) Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to correct the areas of nonconformity through the successful completion of a program improvement plan, and are determined to be in nonconformity on the third and any subsequent full reviews following the first full review in which a determination of nonconformity was made will be subject to increased withholding as follows:

      (i) The amount of funds described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will increase to three percent for each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors that continues in nonconformity since the immediately preceding child and family services review;

      (ii) The increased withholding of funds for areas of continuous nonconformity is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section;

      (iii) The maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply on the third and any subsequent full reviews following the first full review in which the determination of nonconformity was made is 42 percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year to which the withholding of funds applies.

      (c)  (1) For title IV-E agencies determined not to be operating in substantial conformity, ACF will suspend the withholding of the title IV-E agencies' title IV-B and title IV-E funds during the time that a program improvement plan is in effect, provided that:

      (i) The program improvement plan conforms to the provisions of § 1355.35 of this part; and

      (ii) The title IV-E agency is actively implementing the provisions of the program improvement plan.

      (2) Suspension of the withholding of funds is limited to three years following each review, or the amount of time approved for implementation of the program improvement plan, whichever is less.

      (d)  For title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity, ACF will terminate the withholding of the title IV-E agency's title IV-B and title IV-E funds related to the nonconformity upon determination by the title IV-E agency and ACF that the title IV-E agency has achieved substantial conformity or has successfully completed a program improvement plan. ACF will rescind the withholding of the portion of title IV-B and title IV-E funds related to specific goals or action steps as of the date at the end of the quarter in which they were determined to have been achieved.

      (e)  (1) Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to successfully complete a program improvement plan will be notified by ACF of this final determination of nonconformity in writing within 10 business days after the relevant completion date specified in the plan, and advised of the amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds which are to be withheld.

      (2) Title IV-B and title IV-E funds will be withheld based on the following:

      (i) If the title IV-E agency fails to submit status reports in accordance with § 1355.35(d)(4), or if such reports indicate that the title IV-E agency is not making satisfactory progress toward achieving goals or actions steps, funds will be withheld at that time for a period beginning October 1 of the fiscal year for which the determination of nonconformity was made and ending on the specified completion date for the affected goal or action step.

      (ii) Funds related to goals and action steps that have not been achieved by the specified completion date will be withheld at that time for a period beginning October 1 of the fiscal year for which the determination of nonconformity was made and ending on the completion date of the affected goal or action step; and

      (iii) The withholding of funds commensurate with the level of nonconformity at the end of the program improvement plan will begin at the latest completion date specified in the program improvement plan and will continue until a subsequent full review determines the title IV-E agency to be in substantial conformity or the title IV-E agency successfully completes a program improvement plan developed as a result of that subsequent full review.

      (3) When the date the title IV-E agency is determined to be in substantial conformity or to have successfully completed a program improvement plan falls within a specific quarter, the amount of funds to be withheld will be computed to the end of that quarter.

      (4) A title IV-E agency that refuses to participate in the development or implementation of a program improvement plan, as required by ACF, will be subject to the maximum increased withholding of 42 percent of its title IV-B and title IV-E funds, as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, for each year or portion thereof to which the withholding of funds applies.

      (5) The title IV-E agency will be liable for interest on the amount of funds withheld by the Department, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 30.18.

      § 1355.37   Opportunity for public inspection of review reports and materials.

#### § § 1355.37

      The title IV-E agency must make available for public review and inspection all statewide or Tribal assessments (§ 1355.33(b)), report of findings (§ 1355.33(e)), and program improvement plans (§ 1355.35(a)) developed as a result of a full or partial child and family services review.

      § 1355.38   Enforcement of section 471(a)(18) of the Act regarding the removal of barriers to interethnic adoption.

#### § § 1355.38

      (a)  (1) If ACF becomes aware of a possible section 471(a)(18) violation, whether in the course of a child and family services review, the filing of a complaint, or through some other mechanism, it will refer such a case to the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for investigation.

      (2) Based on the findings of the OCR investigation, ACF will determine if a violation of section 471(a)(18) has occurred. A section 471(a)(18) violation occurs if a title IV-E agency or an entity in the State/Tribe:

      (2) Corrective action plans are subject to ACF approval.

      (3) If the corrective action plan does not meet the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the title IV-E agency must revise and resubmit the plan for approval until it has an approved plan.

      (c)  (1) A title IV-E agency found to have committed a violation of the type described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section must develop and submit a corrective action plan within 30 days of receiving written notification from ACF that it is in violation of section 471(a)(18). Once the plan is approved the title IV-E agency will have to complete the corrective action and come into compliance. If the title IV-E agency fails to complete the corrective action plan within six months and come into compliance, a penalty will be imposed in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

      (2) Corrective action plans are subject to ACF approval.

      (3) If the corrective action plan does not meet the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the title IV-E agency must revise and resubmit the plan within 30 days from the date it receives a written notice from ACF that the plan has not been approved.

      (e)  ACF will evaluate corrective action plans and notify the title IV-E agency (in writing) of its success or failure to complete the plan within 30 calendar days. If the title IV-E agency has failed to complete the corrective action plan, ACF will calculate the amount of reduction in the title IV-E agency's title IV-E payment and include this information in the written notification of failure to complete the plan.

      (f)  The term “title IV-E funds” refers to the amount of Federal funds advanced or paid to the title IV-E agency for allowable costs incurred by a title IV-E agency for: foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance payments, administrative costs, and training costs under title IV-E and includes the title IV-E agency's allotment for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program under section 477 of the Act.

      (g)  (1) Title IV-E funds shall be reduced in specified amounts in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section under the following circumstances:

      (i) A determination that a title IV-E agency or entity is in violation of section 471(a)(18) of the Act with respect to a person as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, or:

      (ii) After a title IV-E agency's failure to implement and complete a corrective action plan and come into compliance as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) Once ACF notifies a title IV-E agency (in writing) that it has committed a section 471(a)(18) violation with respect to a person, the title IV-E agency's title IV-E funds will be reduced for the fiscal quarter in which the title IV-E agency received written notification and for each succeeding quarter within that fiscal year or until the title IV-E agency completes a corrective action plan and comes into compliance, whichever is earlier. Once ACF notifies an entity (in writing) that it has committed a section 471(a)(18) violation with respect to a person, the entity must remit to the Secretary all title IV-E funds paid to it by the title IV-E agency during the quarter in which the entity is notified of the violation.

      (3) For title IV-E agencies that fail to complete a corrective action plan within 6 months, title IV-E funds will be reduced by ACF for the fiscal quarter in which the title IV-E agency received notification of its violation. The reduction will continue for each succeeding quarter within that fiscal year or until the title IV-E agency completes the corrective action plan and comes into compliance, whichever is earlier.

      (4) If, as a result of a court finding, a title IV-E agency or entity is determined to be in violation of section 471(a)(18) of the Act, ACF will assess a penalty without further investigation. Once the title IV-E agency is notified (in writing) of the violation, its title IV-E funds will be reduced for the fiscal quarter in which the court finding was made and for each succeeding quarter within that fiscal year or until the title IV-E agency completes a corrective action plan and comes into compliance, whichever is sooner. Once an entity is notified (in writing) of the violation, the entity must remit to the Secretary all title IV-E funds paid to it by the title IV-E agency during the quarter in which the court finding was made.

      (5) The maximum number of quarters that a title IV-E agency will have its title IV-E funds reduced due to a finding of a title IV-E agency's failure to conform to section 471(a)(18) of the Act is limited to the number of quarters within the fiscal year in which a determination of nonconformity was made. However, an uncorrected violation may result in a subsequent review, another finding, and additional penalties.

      (6) No penalty will be imposed for a court finding of a violation of section 471(a)(18) until the judgement is final and all appeals have been exhausted, declined, or the appeal period has expired.

      (h)  ACF will determine the reduction in title IV-E funds due to a section 471(a)(18) violation in accordance with section 474(d)(1) and (2) of the Act.

      (1) Title IV-E agencies that violate section 471(a)(18) with respect to a person or fail to implement or complete a corrective action plan as described in paragraph (c) of this section will be subject to a penalty. The penalty structure will follow section 474(d)(1) of the Act. Penalties will be levied for the quarter of the fiscal year in which the title IV-E agency is notified of its section 471(a)(18) violation, and for each succeeding quarter within that fiscal year until the title IV-E agency comes into compliance with section 471(a)(18). The reduction in title IV-E funds will be computed as follows:

      (i) 2 percent of the title IV-E agency's title IV-E funds for the fiscal year quarter, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, for the first finding of noncompliance in that fiscal year;

      (ii) 3 percent of the title IV-E agency's title IV-E funds for the fiscal year quarter, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, for the second finding of noncompliance in that fiscal year;

      (iii) 5 percent of the title IV-E agency's title IV-E funds for the fiscal year quarter, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, for the third or subsequent finding of noncompliance in that fiscal year.

      (2) Any entity (other than the title IV-E agency) which violates section 471(a)(18) of the Act during a fiscal quarter must remit to the Secretary all title IV-E funds paid to it by the title IV-E agency in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) or (g)(4) of this section.

      (3) No fiscal year payment to a title IV-E agency will be reduced by more than 5 percent of its title IV-E funds, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, where the title IV-E agency has been determined to be out of compliance with section 471(a)(18) of the Act.

      (4) The title IV-E agency or an entity, as applicable, will be liable for interest on the amount of funds reduced by the Department, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 30.18.

      (This requirement has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control Number 0970-0214. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.)

      § 1355.46   Compliance.

#### § § 1355.46

      (a)  ACF will evaluate the out-of-home care and adoption and guardianship assistance data files that a title IV-E agency submits to determine whether the data complies with the requirements of § 1355.43 and the data file submission and data quality standards described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. ACF will exempt records related to a child in either data file whose 18th birthday occurred in a prior report period and will exempt records relating to a child in the adoption and guardianship assistance data file who is in a title IV-E guardianship from a compliance determination as described in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (b)  ACF will utilize the error definitions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section to assess a title IV-E agency's out-of-home care and adoption and guardianship assistance data files. This assessment of errors will help ACF to determine if the title IV-E agency's submitted data files meet the data file submission and data quality standards outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. ACF will develop and issue error specifications.

      (1)  Missing data refers to instances in which a data element has a blank or otherwise missing response, when such a response is not a valid option as described in §§ 1355.44 or 1355.45.

      (2)  Invalid data refers to instances in which a data element contains a value that is outside the parameters of acceptable responses or exceeds, either positively or negatively, the acceptable range of response options as described in §§ 1355.44 or 1355.45.

      (3)  Internally inconsistent data refers to instances in which a data element fails an internal consistency check designed to validate the logical relationship between data elements within each record. This assessment will identify all data elements involved in a particular check as in error.

      (4)  A cross-file error occurs when a cross-file check determines that a response option for a data element recurs across the records in either the out-of-home care data file or adoption and guardianship assistance data file beyond a specified acceptable threshold as specified per ACF.

      (5)  Tardy transactions are instances in which the removal transaction date or exit transaction date described in § 1355.44(d)(2) and (g)(2) respectively, are entered into the title IV-E agency's information system more than 30 days after the event.

      (c)  To be in compliance with the AFCARS requirements, the title IV-E agency must submit a data file in accordance with the data file standards described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.

      (1)  ACF must receive the data files on or before the reporting deadline described in § 1355.43(a).

      (2)  The data files must meet the technical standards issued by ACF for data file construction and transmission. In addition, each record subject to compliance standards within the data file must have the data elements described in §§ 1355.44(a) and (b)(1) and (2) and 1355.45(a) and (b)(1) and (2) be 100 percent free of missing data, invalid data, and internally inconsistent data (see paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section). ACF will not process a title IV-E agency's data file that does not meet the proper format standard.

      (d)  (1) To be in compliance with the AFCARS requirements, the title IV-E agency must submit a data file that has no more than 10 percent total of missing, invalid, or internally inconsistent data, or tardy transactions for each data element of applicable records. These standards are in addition to the formatting standards described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (2)  The data files must be free of cross-file errors that exceed the acceptable thresholds, as defined by ACF.

      (e)  (1) ACF will first determine whether the title IV-E agency's out-of-home care data file and adoption and guardianship assistance data file meets the data file standards in paragraph (c) of this section. Compliance is determined separately for each data file.

      (2) If each data file meets the data file standards, ACF will then determine whether each data file meets the data quality standards in paragraph (d) of this section. For every data element, we will divide the total number of applicable records in error (numerator) by the total number of applicable records (denominator), to determine whether the title IV-E agency has met the applicable data quality standards.

      (3) In general, a title IV-E agency that has not met either the data file formatting standards or data quality standards must submit a corrected data file(s) no later than when data is due for the subsequent six month report period ( by May 15 and November 14), as applicable. ACF will determine that the corrected data file(s) is in compliance if it meets the data file and data standards in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Exception: If ACF determines initially that the title IV-E agency's data file has not met the data quality standard related to tardy transactions, ACF will determine compliance with regard to the transaction dates only in the out-of-home care data file submitted for the subsequent report period.

      (f)  If the title IV-E agency does not submit a corrected data file, or submits a corrected data file that fails to meet the compliance standards in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, ACF will notify the title IV-E agency of such and apply penalties as provided in § 1355.47.

      (g)  ACF may use other monitoring tools or assessment procedures to determine whether the title IV-E agency is meeting all of the requirements of §§ 1355.41 through 1355.45.

      § 1355.47   Penalties.

#### § § 1355.47

      (a)  The funds that are subject to a penalty are the title IV-E agency's claims for title IV-E foster care administration and training for the quarter in which the title IV-E agency is required to submit the data files. For data files due on May 15, ACF will assess the penalty based on the title IV-E agency's claims for the third quarter of the Federal fiscal year. For data files due on November 14, ACF will assess the penalty based on the title IV-E agency's claims for the first quarter of the Federal fiscal year.

      (b)  ACF will assess penalties in the following amounts:

      (1)  ACF will assess a penalty in the amount of one sixth of one percent (  of 1%) of the funds described in paragraph (a) of this section for the first six month period in which the title IV-E agency's submitted corrected data file does not comply with § 1355.46.

      (2)  ACF will assess a penalty in the amount of one fourth of one percent (  of 1%) of the funds described in paragraph (a) of this section for each subsequent six month period in which the title IV-E agency continues to be out of compliance.

      (c)  ACF will offset the title IV-E agency's title IV-E foster care grant award in the amount of the penalty from the title IV-E agency's claims following the title IV-E agency notification of ACF's final determination of noncompliance.

      (d)  The title IV-E agency may appeal ACF's final determination of noncompliance to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board pursuant to 45 CFR part 16.

      § 1356.20   Title IV-E plan document and submission requirements.

#### § § 1356.20

      (a) To be in compliance with the title IV-E plan requirements and to be eligible to receive Federal financial participation (FFP) in the costs of foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance under this part, a title IV-E agency must have a plan approved by the Secretary that meets the requirements of this part, part 1355, section 471(a) of the Act and for Tribal title IV-E agencies, section 479B(c) of the Act. The title IV-E plan must be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office, ACYF, in a form determined by the title IV-E agency.

      (b) Failure by a title IV-E agency to comply with the requirements and standards for the data reporting system for foster care and adoption (§ 1355.40 of this chapter) shall be considered a substantial failure by the title IV-E agency in complying with the plan.

      (c) The following procedures for approval of plans and amendments apply to the title IV-E program:

      (1)  The plan consists of written documents furnished by the title IV-E agency to cover its program under part E of title IV. After approval of the original plan by the Commissioner, ACYF, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that ACYF may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.

      (2)  Plans and revisions of the plans are submitted first to the State governor or his/her designee, or the Tribal leader or his/her designee for review and then to the regional office, ACYF. Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when a plan is in process of preparation or revision.

      (3)  Staff in the regional offices are responsible for review of plans and amendments. They also initiate discussion with the title IV-E agency on clarification of significant aspects of the plan which come to their attention in the course of this review. Plan material on which the regional staff has questions concerning the application of Federal policy is referred with recommendations as required to the central office for technical assistance. Comments and suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in negotiations with the title IV-E agency.

      (4)  ACYF has the authority to approve plans and amendments thereto which provide for the administration of foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance programs under section 471 of the Act. The Commissioner, ACYF, retains the authority to determine that proposed plan material is not approvable, or that a previously approved plan no longer meets the requirements for approval. The Regional Office, ACYF, formally notifies the title IV-E agency of the actions taken on plans or revisions.

      (5)  Determinations as to whether plans (including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plans) originally meet or continue to meet, the requirements for approval are based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations.

      (6)  The determination as to whether a plan submitted for approval conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and regulations issued pursuant thereto shall be made promptly and not later than the 45th day following the date on which the plan submittal is received in the regional office, unless the Regional Office, ACYF, has secured from the title IV-E agency a written agreement to extend that period.

      (7)  Any amendment of an approved plan may, at the option of the title IV-E agency, be considered as a submission of a new plan. If the title IV-E agency requests that such amendment be so considered, the determination as to its conformity with the requirements for approval shall be made promptly and not later than the 45th day following the date on which such a request is received in the regional office with respect to an amendment that has been received in such office, unless the Regional Office, ACYF, has secured from the title IV-E agency a written agreement to extend that period. In absence of request by a title IV-E agency that an amendment of an approved plan shall be considered as a submission of a new plan, the procedures under § 201.6(a) and (b) shall be applicable.

      (8)  The effective date of a new plan may not be earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter in which an approvable plan is submitted, and with respect to expenditures for assistance under such plan, may not be earlier than the first day on which the plan is in operation on a statewide basis or, in the case of a Tribal title IV-E agency, in operation in the Tribal title IV-E agency's entire service area. The same applies with respect to plan amendments.

      (d) Once the title IV-E plan has been submitted and approved, it shall remain in effect until amendments are required. An amendment is required if there is any significant and relevant change in the information or assurances in the plan, or the organization, policies or operations described in the plan.

      § 1356.21   Foster care maintenance payments program implementation requirements.

#### § § 1356.21

      (a)  To implement the foster care maintenance payments program provisions of the title IV-E plan and to be eligible to receive Federal financial participation (FFP) for foster care maintenance payments under this part, a title IV-E agency must meet the requirements of this section, 45 CFR 1356.22, 45 CFR 1356.30, and sections 472, 475(1), 475(4), 475(5), 475(6), and for a Tribal title IV-E agency section 479(B)(c)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act.

      (b)  The title IV-E agency must make reasonable efforts to maintain the family unit and prevent the unnecessary removal of a child from his/her home, as long as the child's safety is assured; to effect the safe reunification of the child and family (if temporary out-of-home placement is necessary to ensure the immediate safety of the child); and to make and finalize alternate permanency plans in a timely manner when reunification is not appropriate or possible. In order to satisfy the “reasonable efforts” requirements of section 471(a)(15) (as implemented through section 472(a)(2) of the Act), the title IV-E agency must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a child and in making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety must be the paramount concern.

      (1)  (i) When a child is removed from his/her home, the judicial determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made, or were not required to prevent the removal, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, must be made no later than 60 days from the date the child is removed from the home pursuant to paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (ii) If the determination concerning reasonable efforts to prevent the removal is not made as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the child is not eligible under the title IV-E foster care maintenance payments program for the duration of that stay in foster care.

      (2)  (i) The title IV-E agency must obtain a judicial determination that it has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan that is in effect (whether the plan is reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, placement with a fit and willing relative, or placement in another planned permanent living arrangement) within twelve months of the date the child is considered to have entered foster care in accordance with the definition at § 1355.20 of this part, and at least once every twelve months thereafter while the child is in foster care.

      (ii) If such a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan is not made in accordance with the schedule prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the child becomes ineligible under title IV-E at the end of the month in which the judicial determination was required to have been made, and remains ineligible until such a determination is made.

      (3)  Reasonable efforts to prevent a child's removal from home or to reunify the child and family are not required if the title IV-E agency obtains a judicial determination that such efforts are not required because:

      (i) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances (as defined in State, or for a Tribal title IV-E agency, Tribal law, which definition may include but need not be limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse);

      (ii) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the parent has been convicted of:

      (A) Murder (which would have been an offense under section 1111(a) of title 18, United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) of another child of the parent;

      (B) Voluntary manslaughter (which would have been an offense under section 1112(a) of title 18, United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) of another child of the parent;

      (C) Aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit such a murder or such a voluntary manslaughter; or

      (D) A felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent; or,

      (iii) The parental rights of the parent with respect to a sibling have been terminated involuntarily.

      (4)  Reasonable efforts to finalize an alternate permanency plan may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family.

      (5)  The State agency may seek the services of the Federal Parent Locator Service to search for absent parents at any point in order to facilitate a permanency plan.

      (c)  Under section 472(a)(2) of the Act, a child's removal from the home must have been the result of a judicial determination (unless the child was removed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement) to the effect that continuation of residence in the home would be contrary to the welfare, or that placement would be in the best interest, of the child. The contrary to the welfare determination must be made in the first court ruling that sanctions (even temporarily) the removal of a child from home. If the determination regarding contrary to the welfare is not made in the first court ruling pertaining to removal from the home, the child is not eligible for title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for the duration of that stay in foster care.

      (d)  The judicial determinations regarding contrary to the welfare, reasonable efforts to prevent removal, and reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan in effect, including judicial determinations that reasonable efforts are not required, must be explicitly documented and must be made on a case-by-case basis and so stated in the court order.

      (1) If the reasonable efforts and contrary to the welfare judicial determinations are not included as required in the court orders identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a transcript of the court proceedings is the only other documentation that will be accepted to verify that these required determinations have been made.

      (2) Neither affidavits nor nunc pro tunc orders will be accepted as verification documentation in support of reasonable efforts and contrary to the welfare judicial determinations except for a Tribal title IV-E agency for the first 12 months that agency's title IV-E plan is in effect as provided for in section 479B(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act.

      (3) Court orders that reference State or Tribal law to substantiate judicial determinations are not acceptable, even if such law provides that a removal must be based on a judicial determination that remaining in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare or that removal can only be ordered after reasonable efforts have been made.

      (e)  A trial home visit may not exceed six months in duration, unless a court orders a longer trial home visit. If a trial home visit extends beyond six months and has not been authorized by the court, or exceeds the time period the court has deemed appropriate, and the child is subsequently returned to foster care, that placement must then be considered a new placement and title IV-E eligibility must be newly established. Under these circumstances the judicial determinations regarding contrary to the welfare and reasonable efforts to prevent removal are required.

      (f)  In order to satisfy the provisions of section 471(a)(16) of the Act regarding a case review system, each title IV-E agency's case review system must meet the requirements of sections 475(5) and 475(6) of the Act.

      (g)  In order to satisfy the case plan requirements of sections 471(a)(16), 475(1) and 475(5)(A) and (D) of the Act, the title IV-E agency must promulgate policy materials and instructions for use by staff to determine the appropriateness of and necessity for the foster care placement of the child. The case plan for each child must:

      (1) Be a written document, which is a discrete part of the case record, in a format determined by the title IV-E agency, which is developed jointly with the parent(s) or guardian of the child in foster care; and

      (2) Be developed within a reasonable period, to be established by the title IV-E agency, but in no event later than 60 days from the child's removal from the home pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section;

      (3) Include a discussion of how the case plan is designed to achieve a safe placement for the child in the least restrictive (most family-like) setting available and in close proximity to the home of the parent(s) when the case plan goal is reunification and a discussion of how the placement is consistent with the best interests and special needs of the child. (FFP is not available when a court orders a placement with a specific foster care provider);

      (4) Include a description of the services offered and provided to prevent removal of the child from the home and to reunify the family; and

      (5) Document the steps to finalize a placement when the case plan goal is or becomes adoption or placement in another permanent home in accordance with sections 475(1)(E) and (5)(E) of the Act. When the case plan goal is adoption, at a minimum, such documentation shall include child-specific recruitment efforts such as the use of State, Tribal, regional, and national adoption exchanges including electronic exchange systems.

      (h)  (1) To meet the requirements of the permanency hearing, the title IV-E agency must, among other requirements, comply with section 475(5)(C) of the Act.

      (2) In accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, when a court determines that reasonable efforts to return the child home are not required, a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination, unless the requirements of the permanency hearing are fulfilled at the hearing in which the court determines that reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family are not required.

      (3) If the title IV-E agency concludes, after considering reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or permanent placement with a fit and willing relative, that the most appropriate permanency plan for a child is placement in another planned permanent living arrangement, the title IV-E agency must document to the court the compelling reason for the alternate plan. Examples of a compelling reason for establishing such a permanency plan may include:

      (i) The case of an older teen who specifically requests that emancipation be established as his/her permanency plan;

      (ii) The case of a parent and child who have a significant bond but the parent is unable to care for the child because of an emotional or physical disability and the child's foster parents have committed to raising him/her to the age of majority and to facilitate visitation with the disabled parent; or,

      (iii) the Tribe has identified another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.

      (4) When an administrative body, appointed or approved by the court, conducts the _permanency hearing_, the procedural safeguards set forth in the definition of  must be so extended by the administrative body.

      (i)  (1) Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the title IV-E agency must file a petition (or, if such a petition has been filed by another party, seek to be joined as a party to the petition) to terminate the parental rights of a parent(s):

      (i) Whose child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the title IV-E agency for 15 of the most recent 22 months. The petition must be filed by the end of the child's fifteenth month in foster care. In calculating when to file a petition for termination of parental rights, the title IV-E agency:

      (A) Must calculate the 15 out of the most recent 22 month period from the date the child is considered to have entered foster care as defined at section 475(5)(F) of the Act and § 1355.20 of this part;

      (B) Must use a cumulative method of calculation when a child experiences multiple exits from and entries into foster care during the 22 month period;

      (C) Must not include trial home visits or runaway episodes in calculating 15 months in foster care; and,

      (D) Need only apply section 475(5)(E) of the Act to a child once if the title IV-E agency does not file a petition because one of the exceptions at paragraph (i)(2) of this section applies;

      (ii) Whose child has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an abandoned infant (as defined under State or for a Tribal title IV-E agency, Tribal law). The petition to terminate parental rights must be filed within 60 days of the judicial determination that the child is an abandoned infant; or,

      (iii) Who has been convicted of one of the felonies listed at paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Under such circumstances, the petition to terminate parental rights must be filed within 60 days of a judicial determination that reasonable efforts to reunify the child and parent are not required.

      (2) The title IV-E agency may elect not to file or join a petition to terminate the parental rights of a parent per paragraph (i)(1) of this section if:

      (i) At the option of the title IV-E agency, the child is being cared for by a relative;

      (ii) The title IV-E agency has documented in the case plan (which must be available for court review) a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the individual child. Compelling reasons for not filing a petition to terminate parental rights include, but are not limited to:

      (A) Adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal for the child; or,

      (B) No grounds to file a petition to terminate parental rights exist; or,

      (C) The child is an unaccompanied refugee minor as defined in 45 CFR 400.111; or

      (D) There are international legal obligations or compelling foreign policy reasons that would preclude terminating parental rights; or

      (iii) The title IV-E agency has not provided to the family, consistent with the time period in the case plan, services that the title IV-E agency deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the home, when reasonable efforts to reunify the family are required.

      (3) When the title IV-E agency files or joins a petition to terminate parental rights in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section, it must concurrently begin to identify, recruit, process, and approve a qualified adoptive family for the child.

      (j)  Foster care maintenance payments made on behalf of a child placed in a foster family home or child care institution, who is the parent of a son or daughter in the same home or institution, must include amounts which are necessary to cover costs incurred on behalf of the child's son or daughter. Said costs must be limited to funds expended on items listed in the definition of  in § 1355.20 of this part.

      (k)  (1) For the purposes of meeting the requirements of section 472(a)(1) of the Act, a removal from the home must occur pursuant to:

      (i) A voluntary placement agreement entered into by a parent or guardian which leads to a physical or constructive removal (i.e., a non-physical or paper removal of custody) of the child from the home; or

      (ii) A judicial order for a physical or constructive removal of the child from a parent or specified relative.

      (2) A removal has not occurred in situations where legal custody is removed from the parent or relative and the child remains with the same relative in that home under supervision by the title IV-E agency.

      (3) A child is considered constructively removed on the date of the first judicial order removing custody, even temporarily, from the appropriate specified relative or the date that the voluntary placement agreement is signed by all relevant parties.

      (l)  For purposes of meeting the requirements for living with a specified relative prior to removal from the home under section 472(a)(1) of the Act, all of the conditions under section 472(a)(3), and for Tribal title IV-E agencies section 479B(c)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act, one of the two following situations must apply:

      (1) The child was living with the parent or specified relative, and was AFDC eligible in that home in the month of the voluntary placement agreement or initiation of court proceedings; or

      (2) The child had been living with the parent or specified relative within six months of the month of the voluntary placement agreement or the initiation of court proceedings, and the child would have been AFDC eligible in that month if s/he had still been living in that home.

      (m)  In meeting the requirements of section 471(a)(11) of the Act, the title IV-E agency must review at reasonable, specific, time-limited periods to be established by the agency:

      (1) The amount of the payments made for foster care maintenance to assure their continued appropriateness, and that the amount made to a licensed or approved relative or kinship foster family home is the same as the amount that would have been made if the child was placed in a licensed or approved non-relative foster family home;

      (2) The amount of the payments made for adoption assistance to assure their continued appropriateness; and

      (3) The licensing or approval standards for child care institutions and foster family homes.

      (n)  The specific foster care goals required under section 471(a)(14) of the Act must be incorporated into State law or Tribal law by statute, code, resolution, Tribal proceedings or administrative regulation with the force of law.

      (o)  The title IV-E agency must provide the foster parent(s) of a child and any preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child with timely notice of and the opportunity to be heard in any proceedings held with respect to the child during the time the child is in the care of such foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caregiver. Notice of and opportunity to be heard does not include the right to standing as a party to the case.

#### § § 1356.30

      (a) The title IV-E agency must provide documentation that criminal records checks have been conducted with respect to prospective foster and adoptive parents.

      (b) The title IV-E agency may not approve or license any prospective foster or adoptive parent, nor may the title IV-E agency claim FFP for any foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payment made on behalf of a child placed in a foster home operated under the auspices of a child placing agency or on behalf of a child placed in an adoptive home through a private adoption agency, if the title IV-E agency finds that, based on a criminal records check conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the prospective foster or adoptive parent has been convicted of a felony involving:

      (b) The adoption assistance agreement for payments pursuant to section 473(a)(2) must meet the requirements of section 475(3) of the Act and must:

      (1) Be signed and in effect at the time of or prior to the final decree of adoption. A copy of the signed agreement must be given to each party; and

      (2) Specify its duration; and

      (e) A title IV-E agency may make an adoption assistance agreement with adopting parent(s) who reside in another State or a Tribal service area. If so, all provisions of this section apply.

      (f) The title IV-E agency must actively seek ways to promote the adoption assistance program.

      § 1356.41   Nonrecurring expenses of adoption.

#### § § 1356.41

      (a) The amount of the payment made for nonrecurring expenses of adoption shall be determined through agreement between the adopting parent(s) and the title IV-E agency administering the program. The agreement must indicate the nature and amount of the nonrecurring expenses to be paid.

      (b) The agreement for nonrecurring expenses may be a separate document or a part of an agreement for either State, Tribal, or Federal adoption assistance payments or services.

      (c) There must be no income eligibility requirement (means test) for adopting parents in determining whether payments for nonrecurring expenses of adoption shall be made. However, parents cannot be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for which they have otherwise been reimbursed.

      (d) For purposes of payment of nonrecurring expenses of adoption, the title IV-E agency must determine that the child is a “child with special needs” as defined in section 473(c) of the Act, and that the child has been placed for adoption in accordance with applicable laws; the child need not meet the categorical eligibility requirements at section 473(a)(2).

      (e)(1) The title IV-E agency must notify all appropriate courts and all public and licensed private nonprofit adoption agencies of the availability of funds for the nonrecurring expenses of adoption of children with special needs as well as where and how interested persons may apply for these funds. This information should routinely be made available to all persons who inquire about adoption services.

      (2) The agreement for nonrecurring expenses must be signed at the time of or prior to the final decree of adoption. Claims must be filed with the title IV-E agency within two years of the date of the final decree of adoption.

      (f)(1) Funds expended by the title IV-E agency under an adoption assistance agreement, with respect to nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on behalf of parents who adopt a child with special needs, shall be considered an administrative expenditure of the title IV-E Adoption Assistance Program. Federal reimbursement is available at a 50 percent matching rate, for title IV-E agency expenditures up to $2,000, for any adoptive placement.

      (2) Title IV-E agencies may set a reasonable lower maximum which must be based on reasonable charges, consistent with State, Tribal, and local practices, for special needs adoptions within the State or Tribal service area. The basis for setting a lower maximum must be documented and available for public inspection.

      (3) In cases where siblings are placed and adopted, either separately or as a unit, each child is treated as an individual with separate reimbursement for nonrecurring expenses up to the maximum amount allowable for each child.

      (g) Federal financial participation for nonrecurring expenses of adoption is limited to costs incurred by or on behalf of adoptive parents that are not otherwise reimbursed from other sources. Payments for nonrecurring expenses shall be made either directly by the title IV-E agency or through another public or licensed nonprofit private agency.

      (h) When the adoption of the child involves a placement outside the State or Tribal service area, the title IV-E agency that enters into an adoption assistance agreement under section 473(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act or under a State or Tribal subsidy program will be responsible for paying the nonrecurring adoption expenses of the child. In cases where there is placement outside the State or Tribal service area but no agreement for other Federal, Tribal, or State adoption assistance, the title IV-E agency in the jurisdiction in which the final adoption decree is issued will be responsible for reimbursement of nonrecurring expenses if the child meets the requirements of section 473(c).

      (i) The term “nonrecurring adoption expenses” means reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs, which are not incurred in violation of State, Tribal or Federal law, and which have not been reimbursed from other sources or other funds. “Other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs” means the costs of the adoption incurred by or on behalf of the parents and for which parents carry the ultimate liability for payment. Such costs may include the adoption study, including health and psychological examination, supervision of the placement prior to adoption, transportation and the reasonable costs of lodging and food for the child and/or the adoptive parents when necessary to complete the placement or adoption process.

      (j) Failure to honor all eligible claims will be considered non-compliance by the title IV-E agency with title IV-E of the Act.

      (k) A title IV-E expenditure is considered made in the quarter during which the payment was made by a title IV-E agency to a private nonprofit agency, individual or vendor payee.

      §§ 1356.69-1356.70   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 1356.69-1356.70

      § 1356.71   Federal review of the eligibility of children in foster care and the eligibility of foster care providers in title IV-E programs.

#### § § 1356.71

      (a)  (1) This section sets forth requirements governing Federal reviews of compliance with the title IV-E eligibility provisions as they apply to children and foster care providers under paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 472 of the Act.

      (2) The requirements of this section apply to title IV-E agencies that receive Federal payments for foster care under title IV-E of the Act.

      (3) The review process begins with a primary review of foster care cases for the title IV-E eligibility requirements.

      (i)  Title IV-E agencies determined to be in substantial compliance based on the primary review will be subject to another review in three years.

      (ii)  Title IV-E agencies that are determined not to be in substantial compliance based on the primary review will develop and implement a program improvement plan designed to correct the areas of noncompliance. A secondary review will be conducted after the completion of the program improvement plan. A subsequent primary review will be held three years from the date of the secondary review.

      (b)  (1) The review team must be composed of representatives of the title IV-E agency, and ACF's Regional and Central Offices.

      (2) The title IV-E agency must provide ACF with the complete payment history for each of the sample and oversample cases prior to the on-site review.

      (c)  (1) The list of sampling units in the target population ( the sampling frame) will be drawn by ACF statistical staff from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data which are transmitted by the title IV-E agency to ACF. The sampling frame will consist of cases of children who were eligible for foster care maintenance payments during the reporting period reflected in a title IV-E agency's most recent AFCARS data submission. For the initial primary review, if these data are not available or are deficient, an alternative sampling frame, consistent with one AFCARS six-month reporting period, will be selected by ACF in conjunction with the title IV-E agency.

      (2) A sample of 80 cases (plus a 10 percent oversample of eight cases) from the title IV-E foster care program will be selected for the primary review utilizing probability sampling methodologies. Usually, the chosen methodology will be simple random sampling, but other probability samples may be utilized, when necessary and appropriate.

      (3) Cases from the oversample will be substituted and reviewed for each of the original sample of 80 cases which is found to be in error.

      (4) At the completion of the primary review, the review team will determine the number of ineligible cases. When the total number of ineligible cases does not exceed eight, ACF can conclude with a probability of 88 percent that in a population of 1000 or more cases the population ineligibility case error rate is less than 15 percent and the title IV-E agency will be considered in substantial compliance.For primary reviews held subsequent to the initial primary reviews, the acceptable population ineligibility case error rate threshold will be reduced from less than 15 percent (eight or fewer ineligible cases) to less than 10 percent (four or fewer ineligible cases)). A title IV-E agency which meets this standard is considered to be in “substantial compliance” (see paragraph (h) of this section). A disallowance will be assessed for the ineligible cases for the period of time the cases are ineligible.

      (5) A title IV-E agency which has been determined to be in “noncompliance” ( not in substantial compliance) will be required to develop a program improvement plan according to the specifications discussed in paragraph (i) of this section, as well as undergo a secondary review. For the secondary review, a sample of 150 cases (plus a 10 percent oversample of 15 cases) will be drawn from the most recent AFCARS submission. Usually, the chosen methodology will be simple random sampling, but other probability samples may be utilized, when necessary and appropriate. Cases from the oversample will be substituted and reviewed for each of the original sample of 150 cases which is found to be in error.

      (6) At the completion of the secondary review, the review team will calculate both the sample case ineligibility and dollar error rates for the cases determined ineligible during the review. An extrapolated disallowance equal to the lower limit of a 90 percent confidence interval for the population total dollars in error for the amount of time corresponding to the AFCARS reporting period will be assessed if both the child/provider (case) ineligibility and dollar error rates exceed 10 percent. If neither, or only one, of the error rates exceeds 10 percent, a disallowance will be assessed for the ineligible cases for the period of time the cases are ineligible.

      (d)  Title IV-E agencies will be reviewed against the requirements of title IV-E of the Act regarding:

      (1) The eligibility of the children on whose behalf the foster care maintenance payments are made (section 472(a)(1)-(4) of the Act) to include:

      (i) Judicial determinations regarding “reasonable efforts” and “contrary to the welfare” in accordance with § 1356.21(b) and (c), respectively;

      (ii) Voluntary placement agreements in accordance with § 1356.22;

      (iii) Responsibility for placement and care vested with the title IV-E or other public agency per section 472(a)(2)(B) of the Act;

      (iv) Placement in a licensed foster family home or child care institution; and,

      (v) Eligibility for AFDC under such State plan as it was in effect on July 16, 1996 per section 472(a)(3) or 479B(c)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act, as appropriate.

      (2) Allowable payments made to foster care providers who comport with sections 471(a)(10), 471(a)(20), 472(b) and (c), and 479B(c)(2) of the Act and § 1356.30.

      (e)  A title IV-E foster care eligibility review checklist will be used when conducting the eligibility review.

      (f)  The case record of the child must contain sufficient documentation to verify a child's eligibility in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in order to substantiate payments made on the child's behalf.

      (g)  (1) For each case being reviewed, the title IV-E agency must make available a licensing file which contains the licensing history, including a copy of the certificate of licensure/approval or letter of approval, for each of the providers in the following categories:

      (i) Public child care institutions with 25 children or less in residence;

      (ii) Private child care institutions;

      (iii) Group homes; and

      (iv) Foster family homes, including relative homes.

      (2) The licensing file must contain documentation that the title IV-E agency has complied with the safety requirements for foster and adoptive placements in accordance with § 1356.30.

      (3) If the licensing file does not contain sufficient information to support a child's placement in a licensed facility, the title IV-E agency may provide supplemental information from other sources ( a computerized database).

      (h)  (1) Disallowances will be taken, and plans for program improvement required, based on the extent to which a title IV-E agency is not in substantial compliance with recipient or provider eligibility provisions of title IV-E, or applicable regulations in 45 CFR parts 1355 and 1356.

      (2) Substantial compliance and noncompliance are defined as follows:

      (i) —For the primary review (of the sample of 80 cases), no more than eight of the title IV-E cases reviewed may be determined to be ineligible. (This critical number of allowable “errors,”  ineligible cases, is reduced to four errors or less in primary reviews held subsequent to the initial primary review). For the secondary review (if required),  means either the case ineligibility or dollar error rate does not exceed 10 percent.

      (ii) —means not in substantial compliance. For the primary review (of the sample of 80 cases), nine or more of the title IV-E cases reviewed must be determined to be ineligible. (This critical number of allowable “errors,”  ineligible cases, is reduced to five or more in primary reviews subsequent to the initial primary review). For the secondary review (if required),  means both the case ineligibility and dollar error rates exceed 10 percent.

      (3) ACF will notify the title IV-E agency in writing within 30 calendar days after the completion of the review of whether the title IV-E agency is, or is not, operating in substantial compliance.

      (4) Title IV-E agencies which are determined to be in substantial compliance must undergo a subsequent review after a minimum of three years.

      (i)  (1) Title IV-E agencies which are determined to be in noncompliance with recipient or provider eligibility provisions of title IV-E, or applicable regulations in 45 CFR Parts 1355 and 1356, will develop a program improvement plan designed to correct the areas determined not to be in substantial compliance. The program improvement plan will:

      (i) Be developed jointly by title IV-E agency and Federal staff;

      (ii) Identify the areas in which the title IV-E agency's program is not in substantial compliance;

      (iii) Not extend beyond one year. A title IV-E agency will have a maximum of one year in which to implement and complete the provisions of the program improvement plan unless State/Tribal legislative action is required. In such instances, an extension may be granted with the title IV-E agency and ACF negotiating the terms and length of such extension that shall not exceed the last day of the first legislative session after the date of the program improvement plan; and

      (iv) Include:

      (A) Specific goals;

      (B) The action steps required to correct each identified weakness or deficiency; and,

      (C) a date by which each of the action steps is to be completed.

      (2) Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial compliance as a result of a primary review must submit the program improvement plan to ACF for approval within 90 calendar days from the date the title IV-E agency receives written notification that it is not in substantial compliance. This deadline may be extended an additional 30 calendar days when a title IV-E agency submits additional documentation to ACF in support of cases determined to be ineligible as a result of the on-site eligibility review.

      (3) The ACF Regional Office will intermittently review, in conjunction with the title IV-E agency, the title IV-E agency's progress in completing the prescribed action steps in the program improvement plan.

      (4) If a title IV-E agency does not submit an approvable program improvement plan in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section, ACF will move to a secondary review in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (j)  The amount of funds to be disallowed will be determined by the extent to which a title IV-E agency is not in substantial compliance with recipient or provider eligibility provisions of title IV-E, or applicable regulations in 45 CFR parts 1355 and 1356.

      (1) Title IV-E agencies which are found to be in substantial compliance during the primary or secondary review will have disallowances (if any) determined on the basis of individual cases reviewed and found to be in error. The amount of disallowance will be computed on the basis of payments associated with ineligible cases for the entire period of time that each case has been ineligible.

      (2) Title IV-E agencies which are found to be in noncompliance during the primary review will have disallowances determined on the basis of individual cases reviewed and found to be in error, and must implement a program improvement plan in accordance with the provisions contained within it. A secondary review will be conducted no later than during the AFCARS reporting period which immediately follows the program improvement plan completion date on a sample of 150 cases drawn from the title IV-E agency's most recent AFCARS data. If both the case ineligibility and dollar error rates exceed 10 percent, the title IV-E agency is not in compliance and an additional disallowance will be determined based on extrapolation from the sample to the universe of claims paid for the duration of the AFCARS reporting period ( all title IV-E funds expended for a case during the quarter(s) that case is ineligible, including administrative costs). If either the case ineligibility or dollar rate does not exceed 10 percent, the amount of disallowance will be computed on the basis of payments associated with ineligible cases for the entire period of time the case has been determined to be ineligible.

      (3) The title IV-E agency will be liable for interest on the amount of funds disallowed by the Department, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 30.18.

      (4) Title IV-E agencies may appeal any disallowance actions taken by ACF to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board in accordance with regulations at 45 CFR part 16.

Alternatively, if the State agency has elected to conduct sampling in accordance with section 1356.84 of this part, the State agency must submit a record containing at least outcomes data for the outcomes status element described in section 1356.83(g)(34) of this part on each 19-year-old youth in the follow-up population, inclusive of those youth who are not in the sample, and each 21-year-old youth in the follow-up sample.

      (3)  The State agency must report outcome information on each youth in the follow-up population at the rates described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. A youth has participated in the outcomes data collection if the State agency collected and reported a valid response (i.e., a response option other than “declined” or “not applicable”) to any of the outcomes-related elements described in section 1356.83(g)(37) through (g)(58) of this part. ACF will exclude from the calculation of the participation rate any youth in the follow-up population who is reported as deceased, incapacitated or incarcerated in section 1356.83(g)(34) at the time information on the follow-up population is required.

      (i)  The State agency must report outcome information on at least 80 percent of youth in the follow-up population who are in foster care on the date of outcomes data collection as indicated in section 1356.83(g)(35) and (g)(36) of this part.

      (ii)  The State agency must report outcome information on at least 60 percent of youth in the follow-up population who are not in foster care on the date of outcomes data collection as indicated in section 1356.83(g)(35) and (g)(36) of this part.

      (iii)  For State agencies electing to sample in accordance with section 1356.84 and appendix C of this part, ACF will apply the outcome participation rates in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to the required sample size for the State.

      (c)  ACF will assess each State agency's data file for the following types of errors: Missing data, out-of-range data, or internally inconsistent data. The amount of errors acceptable for each reporting period is described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (1) Missing data is any element that has a blank response when a blank response is not a valid response option as described in section 1356.83(g) of this part.

      (2) Out-of-range data is any element that contains a value that is outside the parameters of acceptable responses or exceeds, either positively or negatively, the acceptable range of response options as described in section 1356.83(g) of this part; and

      (3) Internally inconsistent data is any element that fails an internal consistency check designed to evaluate the logical relationship between elements in each record. The evaluation will identify all elements involved in a particular check as in error.

      (d)  (1) ACF will determine whether a State agency's data file for each reporting period is in compliance with the file submission standards and data standards in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (i) For State agencies that achieve the file submission standards, ACF will determine whether the State agency's data file meets the data standards.

      (ii) For State agencies that do not achieve the file submission standards or data standards, ACF will notify the State agency that they have an opportunity to submit a corrected data file by the end of the subsequent reporting period in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (2) ACF may use monitoring tools or assessment procedures to determine whether the State agency is meeting all the requirements of section 1356.81 through 1356.85 of this part.

      (e)  A State agency that does not submit a data file that meets the standards in section 1356.85 of this part will have an opportunity to submit a corrected data file in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

      (1) A State agency must submit a corrected data file no later than the end of the subsequent reporting period as defined in section 1356.83(a) of this part (i.e., by September 30 or March 31).

      (2) If a State agency fails to submit a corrected data file that meets the compliance standards in section 1356.85 of this part and the deadline in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, ACF will make a final determination that the State is out of compliance, notify the State agency, and apply penalties as defined in section 1356.86 of this part.

      (4) The State or Indian Tribe must assure that standards and requirements imposed with respect to child care under title XX shall apply with respect to day care services, if provided under the CFSP, except insofar as eligibility for such services is involved.

      (d)  The State and the Indian Tribe must base the development of the CFSP on a planning process that includes:

      (1) broad involvement and consultation with a wide range of appropriate public and non-profit private agencies and community-based organizations, parents, including parents who are involved or have experience with the child welfare system, and others;

      (2) coordination of the provision of services under the plan with other Federal and federally assisted programs serving children and families, including youth and adolescents; and

      (f)  (1) The Indian Tribe's CFSP must provide the name of the Indian Tribal organization (ITO) designated to administer funds under title IV-B, subpart 1, child welfare services and/or under subpart 2, family preservation and family support services. If the Indian Tribe receives funds under both subparts, the same agency or organization must administer both programs.

      (2) The Indian Tribe's CFSP must include a description of the organization and function of the office responsible for the operation and administration of the CFSP, an organizational chart of that office, and a description of how that office relates to Tribal and other offices operating or administering services programs within the Indian Tribe's service area (e.g., Indian Health Service.)

      (g)  The CFSP must include a vision statement which articulates the grantee's philosophy in providing child and family services and developing or improving a coordinated service delivery system. The vision should reflect the service principles at section 1355.25.

      (h)  The CFSP must specify the goals, based on the vision statement, that will be accomplished during and by the end of the five-year period of the plan.

      (i)  (1) The CFSP must include the realistic, specific, quantifiable and measurable objectives that will be undertaken to achieve each goal. Each objective should focus on outcomes for children, youth, and/or their families or on elements of service delivery (such as quality) that are linked to outcomes in important ways. Each objective should include both interim benchmarks and a long-term timetable, as appropriate, for achieving the objective.

      (2) For States and Indian Tribes administering the title IV-B, subpart 1 program, the CFSP must include objectives to make progress in covering additional political subdivisions, reaching additional children in need of services, expanding and strengthening the range of existing services, and developing new types of services.

      (j)  The CFSP must describe the methods to be used in measuring the results, accomplishments, and annual progress toward meeting the goals and objectives, especially the outcomes for children, youth, and families. Processes and procedures assuring the production of valid and reliable data and information must be specified.

      (k)  (1) For FY 1995, the State and the Indian Tribe must base the development of the CFSP vision, goals, objectives, and funding and service decisions on an analysis of available baseline information and any trends over time on indicators in the following areas: the well-being of children and families; the needs of children and families; the nature, scope, and adequacy of existing child and family and related social services. Additional and updated information on service needs and organizational capacities must be obtained throughout the five-year period to measure progress in accomplishing the goals and objectives cited in the CFSP. A description of how this process will continue to be carried out must be included in the CFSP, and any revisions should be provided in the Annual Progress and Services Report.

      (2) The State must collect and analyze State-wide information on family preservation and family support services currently available to families and children, including the nature and scope of existing public and privately funded family support and family preservation services; the extent to which each service is available and being provided in different geographic areas and to different types of families; and important gaps in service, including mismatches between available services and family needs as identified through baseline data and the consultation process. Other services which impact on the ability to preserve and support families may be included in the assessment. The Indian Tribe must collect and analyze information on family preservation and family support services currently available within their service delivery area including the information in this paragraph as appropriate. An Indian Tribe may submit documentation prepared to satisfy the requirements of other Federal child welfare grants, or contracts (such as the section 638 reporting form), along with a descriptive addendum addressing specifically the family preservation and family support services available.

      (2) The State's CFSP must explain whether and/or how funds under the CAPTA and independent living programs are coordinated with and integrated into the child and family services continuum described in the plan.

      (3) The State's CFSP must describe the existing or current linkages and the coordination of services between the services in the child and family services continuum and the services in other public services systems (e.g., health, education, housing, substance abuse, the courts), and other Federal and non-federally funded public and nonprofit private programs (e.g., Children's Trust Funds, Community-Based Family Resource Programs, private foundations.)

      (p)  The CFSP must describe how the child and family services to be provided are designed to assure the safety and protection of children as well as the preservation and support of families, and how they are or will be designed to be consistent with the other service principles in 45 CFR 1355.25.

      (q)  For States administering both title IV-B programs (subparts 1 and 2), the CFSP must explain how these services will help meet the permanency provisions for children and families in sections 422(b)(9) and 471 of the Act (e.g., preplacement preventive services, reunification services, independent living services.) The CFSP must describe the arrangements, jointly developed with the Indian Tribes within its borders, made for the provision of the child welfare services and protections in section 422(b)(9) to Indian children under both State and Tribal jurisdiction.

      (r)  The State's CFSP must include an explanation of how agencies and organizations were selected for funding to provide family support services and how these agencies and organizations meet the requirement that family support services be community-based.

      (s)  With each fiscal year's budget request, each State must indicate the specific percentage of family preservation and family support funds (title IV-B, subpart 2) that the State will expend for community-based family support and for family preservation services, and the rationale for the decision. The State must have an especially strong rationale if the request for either percentage is below 25 percent. It must also include an explanation of how this distribution was reached and why it meets the requirements that a “significant portion” of the service funds must be spent for each service. Examples of important considerations might include the nature of the planning efforts that led to the decision, the level of existing State effort in each area, and the resulting need for new or expanded services.

      (t)  (1) The State's CFSP must include a staff development and training plan in support of the goals and objectives in the CFSP which addresses both of the title IV-B programs covered by the plan. This training plan also must be combined with the training plan under title IV-E as required by 45 CFR 1356.60(b)(2). Training must be an on-going activity and must include content from various disciplines and knowledge bases relevant to child and family services policies, programs and practices. Training content must also support the cross-system coordination consultation basic to the development of the CFSP.

      (2) The State's CFSP must describe the technical assistance activities that will be undertaken in support of the goals and objectives in the plan.

      (3) The State's CFSP must describe any evaluation and research activities underway or planned with which the State agency is involved or participating and which are related to the goals and objectives in the plan.

      (u)  The State must include in the CFSP a description of the quality assurance system it will use to regularly assess the quality of services under the CFSP and assure that there will be measures to address identified problems.

      (v)  The CFSP must include a description of how the State and the Indian Tribe will make available to interested parties the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report. (See 45 CFR 1355.21(c) and 45 CFR 1357.16(d)). State agencies and Indian Tribal organizations within the State must exchange copies of their CFSPs and their annual services reports.

      (2) In order for States and eligible Indian Tribes to receive title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2 allocations a CFS-101 must be submitted for each fiscal year.

      (3) States and Indian Tribes which have consolidated the requirements for title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2, must submit the CFS-101 to the appropriate ACF Regional Office no later than June 30 of the year prior to the fiscal year in which the services will be provided (e.g., for FY 1997 allocations, the CFS-101 must be submitted by June 30, 1996; for FY 1998 allocations, the CFS-101 must be submitted by June 30, 1997.)

      (1) Prepare a final report on the progress made toward accomplishing the goals and objectives; and

      (2) Send the final report to the ACF Regional Office and make it available to the public.

      (1) The State's contribution may be in cash, donated funds, and non-public third party in-kind contributions.

      (2) Except as provided by Federal statute, other Federal funds may not be used to meet the matching requirement.

      (f)  States may not use the Federal funds under title IV-B, subpart 2, to supplant Federal or non-Federal funds for existing family preservation and family support services. For the purpose of implementing this requirement, “non-Federal funds” means State funds. ACF will collect information annually from each State on expenditures for family support and family preservation using the State fiscal year 1992 as the base year.

      (g)  Funds must be expended by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded.

      (h)  (1) States claiming Federal financial participation for services provided in FY 1994 and subsequent years may not claim more than 10 percent of expenditures under subpart 2 for administrative costs.

      (2) The Indian Tribe or Tribal organization must also comply with section 422(b)(1-8) of the Act; 45 CFR part 1355 (except that the requirements in § 1355.30 for a single Tribal agency and Governor's review of the CFSP do not apply); and other applicable requirements of §§ 1357.10 and 1357.16.

      (c)  The following information must be submitted with the assurances required to be eligible for title IV-B, subpart 1 funds:

      (3) A description of Tribal jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, existence or nonexistence of a Tribal court and the type of court and codes, if any;

      (4) An identification of the standards for foster family homes and institutional care and day care;

      (5) The Indian Tribal organization's political subdivisions, if any;

      (6) Whether the Tribal organization is controlled, sanctioned or chartered by the governing body of Indians to be served and if so, documentation of that fact;

      (d)  (1) Grants may be made to eligible Indian Tribal organizations in a State which has a jointly developed child and family services plan approved and in effect.

      (2) Federal funds made available for a direct grant to an eligible ITO shall be paid by the Department, from the title IV-B allotment for the State in which the ITO is located. Should a direct grant be approved, the Department shall promptly notify the State(s) affected.

      (3) If an eligible ITO includes population from more than one State, a proportionate amount of the grant will be paid from each State's allotment.

      (4) The receipt of title IV-B funds must be in addition to and not a substitute for funds otherwise previously expended by the ITO for child welfare services.

      (5) The following fiscal and administrative requirements apply to Indian Tribal grants under this section:

      (i)  In the event of an Indian Tribe's failure to comply with the terms of the grant under title IV-B, subpart 1, the provisions of 45 CFR 75.371 through 75.372 will apply.

      (ii)  Federal financial participation is available only if costs are incurred in implementing sections 422, 423, and 425 of the Act in accordance with the grants administration requirements of 45 CFR part 75 with the following conditions—

      () Child day care necessary solely because of the employment, or training to prepare for employment, of a parent or other relative with whom the child involved is living, plus;

      () Foster care maintenance payments, plus;

      () Adoption assistance payments.

      (iv)  Funds under title IV-B, subpart 1, must be expended by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded.

      (6) In order to determine the amount of Federal funds available for a direct grant to an eligible ITO, the Department shall first divide the State's title IV-B allotment by the number of children in the State, then multiply the resulting amount by a multiplication factor determined by the Secretary, and then multiply that amount by the number of Indian children in the ITO population. The multiplication factor will be set at a level designed to achieve the purposes of the act and revised as appropriate.

      § 1357.50   Direct payments to Indian Tribal organizations (title IV-B, subpart 2, family preservation and support services).

#### § § 1357.50

      (a)

      means any organized group of Alaska Natives eligible to operate a Federal program under the Indian Self-Determination Act (Pub. L. 93-638) or such group's designee as defined in section 482(i)(7)(A) of the Act.

      means any Tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians that is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; and for which a reservation (including Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, and former Indian reservations in Oklahoma) exists.

      means the recognized governing body of the Indian Tribe.

      (b)  (1) Section 432(b)(2) of the Act provides that the Secretary may not approve a plan of an Indian Tribe whose FY 1995 allotment under subpart 2 would be less than $10,000. Therefore, only those Indian Tribes whose FY 1995 allotment is $10,000 or more are eligible to receive funds beginning in FY 1994.

      (2) ACF will pay any amount to which an Indian Tribe is entitled to the Tribal organization of the Indian Tribe.

      (c)  In order to receive funds under title IV-B, subpart 2, in FY 1995, an Indian Tribe that is eligible for planning funds in FY 1994 must submit a Child and Family Services Plan that meets the applicable requirements in section 1357.15 of this Part.

      (d)  (1) ACF will make grants to additional Indian Tribes in Fys 1996 through 1998 in the event that there are increased appropriations.

      (2) Allotments will be calculated in Fys 1996, 1997, and 1998 as required in section 433 of the Act. Those Indian Tribes in each year whose allotment is at least $10,000 will be notified of their eligibility to apply.

      (3) In order to receive funds, additional Indian Tribes which become eligible for grants in FY 1996, 1997, and 1998 must submit either a five year Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) that meets the applicable requirements of 45 CFR 1357.15 or an application for planning funds by June 30 of the year in which they first become eligible for grants. Those Indian Tribes which submitted an application for planning funds in their first year of funding must submit a five year CFSP that meets the applicable requirements of 45 CFR 1357.15 by June 30 of the second year they receive funding. For example, in order to receive funds, an Indian Tribe which becomes eligible to receive funding beginning in FY 1996 must submit either an application for planning funds or a CFSP by June 30, 1996. If the Indian Tribe submitted an application for planning funds in FY 1996, they must submit a CFSP by June 30, 1997.

      (4) All Indian Tribes will be Federally reimbursed at 75 percent of allowable expenditures. Federal funds without match are available in the first year of receipt of funds for additional Indian Tribes meeting the following criteria:

      (i) Submittal of an application for planning funds, and not a five year CFSP;

      (ii) Receipt of an initial award in FY 1996 or 1997 or 1998; and

      (iii) A proposal to spend the entire grant in the first year on planning.

      (e)  Allotments to Indian Tribes are computed based on section 433 of the Act and are based on a ratio of the number of children in each Indian Tribe with an approved plan compared to the number of children in all Indian Tribes with approved plans, based on the most current and reliable data available.

      (f)  (1) ACF has exempted Indian Tribes from three statutory requirements:

      (i) The limitation on administrative costs to 10 percent of total Federal and Tribal funds—Indian Tribes may use the indirect cost rate agreement in effect for the Tribe;

      (ii) The requirement for maintenance of effort that funds under this program may not be used to supplant other Federal and non-Federal funds; and

      (iii) The requirement that a significant portion of funds must be used for both family support and family preservation services.

      (2) Specific exemptions from other statutory requirements may be requested by the Tribe in the course of its joint planning. Such a request must contain a compelling reason.

      (g)  (1) Funds used to provide services in FY 1994 and in subsequent years will be federally reimbursed at 75 percent of allowable expenditures. (This is the same Federal financial participation rate as title IV-B, subpart 1.) The Indian Tribe's match must be at least 25 percent of the total project costs or one-third of the Federal share. Federal funds, however, will not exceed the amount of the Indian Tribe's allotment.

      (2) The Indian Tribe's contribution may be in cash, donated funds, and non-public third party in-kind contributions.

      (3) Indian Tribes, by statute, may use the following three Federal sources of funds as matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds.

      (h)  An Indian Tribe must expend all funds by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded.

## Subchapter H

    PART 1370—FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SERVICES PROGRAMS

### Part 1370

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 10401

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 76471, Nov. 2, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1370.1   What are the purposes of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act Programs?

#### § § 1370.1

        This part addresses sections 301 through 313 of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), as amended, and codified at 42 U.S.C. 10401  FVPSA authorizes the Secretary to implement programs for the purposes of increasing public awareness about and preventing family violence, _domestic violence_, and dating violence; providing immediate shelter and supportive services for victims of family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence and their dependents; providing for technical assistance and training relating to family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence programs; providing for State Domestic Violence Coalitions; providing specialized services for abused parents and their children; and operating a national  hotline. FVPSA emphasizes both primary, and secondary, prevention of violence.

        § 1370.2   What definitions apply to these programs?

#### § § 1370.2

        For the purposes of this part:

        means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: The length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. This part of the definition reflects the definition also found in Section 40002(a) of VAWA (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 13925(a), as required by FVPSA. _Dating violence_ also includes but is not limited to the physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship, including stalking. It can happen in person or electronically, and may involve financial abuse or other forms of manipulation which may occur between a current or former dating partner regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.

        means felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. This definition also reflects the statutory definition of “domestic violence” found in Section 40002(a) of VAWA (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 13925(a). This definition also includes but is not limited to criminal or non-criminal acts constituting intimidation, control, coercion and coercive control, emotional and psychological abuse and behavior, expressive and psychological aggression, financial abuse, harassment, tormenting behavior, disturbing or alarming behavior, and additional acts recognized in other Federal, Tribal State, and local laws as well as acts in other Federal regulatory or sub-regulatory guidance. This definition is not intended to be interpreted more restrictively than FVPSA and VAWA but rather to be inclusive of other, more expansive definitions. The definition applies to individuals and relationships regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.

        means any act or threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention of an individual, that results or threatens to result in physical injury and is committed by a person against another individual, to or with whom such person is related by blood or marriage, or is or was otherwise legally related, or is or was lawfully residing.

        is individually identifying information for or about an individual including information likely to disclose the location of a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, regardless of whether the information is encoded, encrypted, hashed, or otherwise protected, including, a first and last name; a home or other physical address; contact information (including a postal, email or Internet protocol address, or telephone or facsimile number); a social security number, driver license number, passport number, or student identification number; and any other information, including date of birth, racial or ethnic background, or religious affiliation, that would serve to identify any individual.

        means strategies, policies, and programs to stop both first-time perpetration and first-time victimization. _Primary prevention_ is stopping domestic and dating violence before they occur. Primary prevention includes, but is not limited to: School-based violence prevention curricula, programs aimed at mitigating the effects on children of witnessing domestic or dating violence, community campaigns designed to alter norms and values conducive to domestic or dating violence, worksite prevention programs, and training and education in parenting skills and self-esteem enhancement.

        for the term only as it appears in the definition of State Domestic Violence Coalition, means an entity that operates a project of demonstrated effectiveness carried out by a nonprofit, nongovernmental, private entity, Tribe, or Tribal organization, that has as its project's primary-purpose the operation of shelters and supportive services for victims of domestic violence and their dependents; or has as its project's primary purpose counseling, advocacy, or self-help services to victims of domestic violence. Territorial Domestic Violence Coalitions may include government-operated domestic violence projects as primary-purpose domestic violence service providers for complying with the membership requirement, provided that Territorial Coalitions can document providing training, technical assistance, and capacity-building of community-based and privately operated projects to provide shelter and supportive services to victims of family, domestic, or dating violence, with the intention of recruiting such projects as members once they are sustainable as primary-purpose domestic violence service providers.

        is identifying risk factors or problems that may lead to future family, domestic, or dating violence, and taking the necessary actions to eliminate the risk factors and the potential problem, and may include, but are not limited to, healing services for children and youth who have been exposed to domestic or dating violence, home visiting programs for high-risk families, and screening programs in health care settings.

        means the provision of temporary refuge in conjunction with supportive services in compliance with applicable State or Tribal law or regulations governing the provision, on a regular basis, of shelter, safe homes, meals, and supportive services to victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, and their dependents. State and Tribal law governing the provision of shelter and supportive services on a regular basis is interpreted by ACF to mean, for example, the laws and regulations applicable to zoning, fire safety, and other regular safety, and operational requirements, including State, Tribal, or local regulatory standards for certifying domestic violence advocates who work in shelter. This definition also includes emergency shelter and immediate shelter, which may include housing provision, rental subsidies, temporary refuge, or lodging in properties that could be individual units for families and individuals (such as apartments) in multiple locations around a local jurisdiction, Tribe/reservation, or State; such properties are not required to be owned, operated, or leased by the program. Temporary refuge includes a residential service, including shelter and off-site services such as hotel or motel vouchers or individual dwellings, which is not transitional or permanent housing, but must also provide comprehensive supportive services. The mere act of making a referral to shelter or housing shall not itself be considered provision of shelter. Should other jurisdictional laws conflict with this definition of temporary refuge, the definition which provides more expansive housing accessibility governs.

        means each of the several _State_s, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, except as otherwise provided in statute, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        means a Statewide, nongovernmental, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization whose membership includes a majority of the primary-purpose domestic violence service providers in the State; whose board membership is representative of these primary-purpose domestic violence service providers and which may include representatives of the communities in which the services are being provided in the State; that has as its purpose to provide education, support, and technical assistance to such service providers to enable the providers to establish and maintain supportive services and to provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and their children; and that serves as an information clearinghouse, primary point of contact, and resource center on domestic violence for the State and supports the development of policies, protocols and procedures to enhance domestic violence intervention and prevention in the State/Territory.

        means services for adult and youth victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, and their dependents that are designed to meet the needs of such victims and their dependents for short-term, transitional, or long-term safety and recovery. _Supportive services_ include, but are not limited to: Direct and/or referral-based advocacy on behalf of victims and their dependents, counseling, case management, employment services, referrals, transportation services, legal advocacy or assistance, child care services, health, behavioral health and preventive health services, culturally and linguistically appropriate services, and other services that assist victims or their dependents in recovering from the effects of the violence. To the extent not already described in this definition, supportive services also include but are not limited to other services identified in FVPSA at 42 U.S.C. 10408(b)(1)(A)-(H). Supportive services may be directly provided by grantees and/or by providing advocacy or referrals to assist victims in accessing such services.

        means populations who face barriers in accessing and using victim services, and includes populations underserved because of geographic location, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, underserved racial and ethnic populations, and populations underserved because of special needs including language barriers, disabilities, immigration status, and age. Individuals with criminal histories due to victimization and individuals with substance use disorders and mental health issues are also included in this definition. The reference to racial and ethnic populations is primarily directed toward racial and ethnic minority groups (as defined in section 1707(g) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300(u-6)(g)), which means American Indians (including Alaska Natives, Eskimos, and Aleuts); Asian American; Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders; Blacks and Hispanics. The term “Hispanic” or “Latino” means individuals whose origin is Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or any other Spanish-speaking country. This underserved populations' definition also includes other population categories determined by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee to be underserved.

        § 1370.4   What confidentiality requirements apply to these programs?

#### § § 1370.4

        (a) In order to ensure the safety of adult, youth, and child victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, and their families, grantees and subgrantees under FVPSA shall protect the confidentiality and privacy of such victims and their families. Subject to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall not—

        (1) Disclose any personally identifying information (as defined in § 1370.2) collected in connection with services requested (including services utilized or denied) through grantees' and subgrantees' programs;

        (2) Reveal any personally identifying information without informed, written, reasonably time-limited consent by the person about whom information is sought, whether for this program or any other Federal, Tribal or State grant program, including but not limited to whether to comply with Federal, Tribal, or State reporting, evaluation, or data collection requirements; or

        (3) Require an adult, youth, or child victim of family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence to provide a consent to release his or her personally identifying information as a condition of eligibility for the services provided by the grantee or subgrantee.

        (b) Consent shall be given by the person, except in the case of an unemancipated minor it shall be given by both the minor and the minor's parent or guardian; or in the case of an individual with a guardian it shall be given by the individual's guardian. A parent or guardian may not give consent if: he or she is the abuser or suspected abuser of the minor or individual with a guardian; or, the abuser or suspected abuser of the other parent of the minor. If a minor or a person with a legally appointed guardian is permitted by law to receive services without the parent's or guardian's consent, the minor or person with a guardian may release information without additional consent. Reasonable accommodations shall also be made for those who may be unable, due to disability or other functional limitation, to provide consent in writing.

        (c) If the release of information described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is compelled by statutory or court mandate:

        (1) Grantees and sub-grantees shall make reasonable attempts to provide notice to victims affected by the release of the information; and

        (2) Grantees and subgrantees shall take steps necessary to protect the privacy and safety of the persons affected by the release of the information.

        (d) Grantees and subgrantees may share:

        (1) Non-personally identifying information, in the aggregate, regarding services to their clients and demographic non-personally identifying information in order to comply with Federal, State, or Tribal reporting, evaluation, or data collection requirements;

        (2) Court-generated information and law enforcement-generated information contained in secure, governmental registries for protective order enforcement purposes; and

        (3) Law enforcement- and prosecution-generated information necessary for law enforcement and prosecution purposes.

        (4) Personally identifying information may be shared with a health care provider or payer, but only with the informed, written, reasonably time-limited consent of the person about whom such information is sought.

        (e) Nothing in this section prohibits a grantee or subgrantee, where mandated or expressly permitted by the State or Indian Tribe, from reporting abuse and neglect, as those terms are defined by law, or from reporting imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death of the victim or another person.

        (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any provision of any Federal, State, Tribal, or local law that provides greater protection than this section for victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence.

        (g) The address or location of any shelter facility assisted that maintains a confidential location shall, except with written authorization of the person or persons responsible for the operation of such shelter, not be made public.

        (1) Shelters which choose to remain confidential pursuant to this rule must develop and maintain systems and protocols to remain secure, which must include policies to respond to disruptive or dangerous contact from abusers, and

        (2) Tribal governments, while exercising due diligence to comply with statutory provisions and this rule, may determine how best to maintain the safety and confidentiality of shelter locations.

        § 1370.5   What additional non-discrimination requirements apply to these programs?

#### § § 1370.5

        (a) No person shall on the ground of actual or perceived sex, including gender identity, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or activity funded in whole or in part through FVPSA.

        (1) FVPSA grantees and subgrantees must provide comparable services to victims regardless of actual or perceived sex, including gender identity. This includes not only providing access to services for all victims, including male victims, of family, domestic, and dating violence regardless of actual or perceived sex, including gender identity, but also making sure not to limit services for victims with adolescent children (under the age of 18) on the basis of the actual or perceived sex, including gender identity, of the children. Victims and their minor children must be sheltered or housed together, regardless of actual or perceived sex, including gender identity, unless requested otherwise or unless the factors or considerations identified in § 1370.5(a)(2) require an exception to this general rule.

        (2) No such program or activity is required to include an individual in such program or activity without taking into consideration that individual's sex in those certain instances where sex is a bona fide occupational qualification or a programmatic factor reasonably necessary to the essential operation of that particular program or activity. If sex segregation or sex-specific programming is essential to the normal or safe operation of the program, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent any such program or activity from consideration of an individual's sex. In such circumstances, grantees and subgrantees may meet the requirements of this paragraph by providing comparable services to individuals who cannot be provided with the sex-segregated or sex-specific programming, including access to a comparable length of stay, supportive services, and transportation as needed to access services. If a grantee or subgrantee determines that sex-segregated or sex-specific programming is essential for the normal or safe operation of the program, it must support its justification with an assessment of the facts and circumstances surrounding the specific program, including an analysis of factors discussed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and take into account established field-based best practices and research findings, as applicable. The justification cannot rely on unsupported assumptions or overly-broad sex-based generalizations. An individual must be treated consistent with their gender identity in accordance with this section.

        (3) Factors that may be relevant to a grantee's or subgrantee's evaluation of whether sex-segregated or sex-specific programming is essential to the normal or safe operations of the program include, but are not limited, to the following: The nature of the service, the anticipated positive and negative consequences to all eligible beneficiaries of not providing the program in a sex-segregated or sex-specific manner, the literature on the efficacy of the service being sex-segregated or sex-specific, and whether similarly-situated grantees and subgrantees providing the same services have been successful in providing services effectively in a manner that is not sex-segregated or sex-specific. A grantee or subgrantee may not provide sex-segregated or sex-specific services for reasons that are trivial or based on the grantee's or subgrantee's convenience.

        (4) As with all individuals served, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals must have equal access to FVPSA-funded shelter and nonresidential programs. Programmatic accessibility for transgender and gender nonconforming survivors and minor children must be afforded to meet individual needs consistent with the individual's gender identity. ACF requires that a FVPSA grantee or subgrantee that makes decisions about eligibility for or placement into single-sex emergency shelters or other facilities offer every individual an assignment consistent with their gender identity. For the purpose of assigning a service beneficiary to sex-segregated or sex-specific services, the grantee/subgrantee may ask a beneficiary which group or services the beneficiary wishes to join. The grantee/subgrantee may not, however, ask questions about the beneficiary's anatomy or medical history or make demands for identity documents or other documentation of gender. A victim's/beneficiary's or potential victim's/beneficiary's request for an alternative or additional accommodation for purposes of personal health, privacy, or safety must be given serious consideration in making the placement. For instance, if the potential victim/beneficiary requests to be placed based on his or her sex assigned at birth, ACF requires that the provider will place the individual in accordance with that request, consistent with health, safety, and privacy concerns of the individual. ACF also requires that a provider will not make an assignment or re-assignment of the transgender or gender nonconforming individual based on complaints of another person when the sole stated basis of the complaint is a victim/client or potential victim/client's non-conformance with gender stereotypes or sex, including gender identity.

        (b) An organization that participates in programs funded through the FVPSA shall not, in providing services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.

        (1) Dietary practices dictated by particular religious beliefs may require reasonable accommodation in cooking or feeding arrangements for particular beneficiaries as practicable. Additionally, other forms of religious practice may require reasonable accommodation including, but not limited to, shelters that have cleaning schedules may need to account for a survivor's religion which prohibits him/her from working on religious holidays.

        (c) No person shall on the ground of actual or perceived sexual orientation be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or activity funded in whole or in part through FVPSA.

        (1) All programs must take into account participants' needs and be inclusive and not stigmatize participants based on actual or perceived sexual orientation.

        (d) All FVPSA-funded services must be provided without requiring documentation of immigration status because HHS has determined that FVPSA-funded services do not fall within the definition of federal public benefit that would require verification of immigration status.

        (e) Grantees and subgrantees should create a plan to ensure effective communication and equal access, including:

        (1) How to identify and communicate with individuals with Limited English Proficiency, and how to identify and properly use qualified interpretation and translation services, and taglines; and

        (2) How to take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, beneficiaries, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications with others; and furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified individuals with disabilities, including applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity. Auxiliary aids and services include qualified interpreters and large print materials.

        (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate or limit the rights, remedies, procedures, or legal standards available to individuals under other applicable law.

        (g) The Secretary shall enforce the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in accordance with section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-1). Section 603 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2) shall apply with respect to any action taken by the Secretary to enforce this section.

        § 1370.6   What requirements for reports and evaluations apply to these programs?

#### § § 1370.6

        Each entity receiving a grant or contract under these programs shall submit a performance report to the Secretary at such time as required by the Secretary. Such performance report shall describe the activities that have been carried out, contain an evaluation of the effectiveness of such activities, and provide such additional information as the Secretary may require. Territorial governments which consolidate FVPSA funds with other HHS funds in a Consolidated Block Grant pursuant to 45 CFR part 97 are not required to submit annual FVPSA performance progress reports and programmatic assurances if FVPSA funds are not designated in the consolidation application for FVPSA purposes. If a territorial government either does not consolidate FVPSA funds with other HHS funds or does consolidate but indicates that FVPSA funds will be used for FVPSA purposes, the territorial government must submit an annual FVPSA performance progress report and programmatic assurances to FYSB.

      Subpart B—State and Indian Tribal Grants

        § 1370.10   What additional requirements apply to State and Indian Tribal grants?

#### § § 1370.10

        (a) These grants assist States and Tribes to support the establishment, maintenance, and expansion of programs and projects to prevent incidents of family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence; to provide immediate shelter, supportive services, and access to community-based programs for victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, and their dependents; and to provide specialized services for children exposed to family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, including victims who are members of underserved populations. States must consult with and provide for the participation of State Domestic Violence Coalitions and Tribal Coalitions in the planning and monitoring of the distribution and administration of subgrant programs and projects. At a minimum to further FVPSA requirements, States and State Domestic Violence Coalitions will work together to determine grant priorities based upon jointly identified needs; to identify strategies to address needs; to define mutual expectations regarding programmatic performance and monitoring; and to implement an annual collaboration plan that incorporates concrete steps for accomplishing these tasks. If States also fund State Domestic Violence Coalitions to provide training, technical assistance, or other programming, nothing in this rule is intended to conflict with State contracting requirements regarding conflicts of interest but rather that this rule's requirements should be interpreted to complement States' contracting and procurement laws and regulations. States must involve community-based organizations that primarily serve underserved populations, including culturally- and linguistically-specific populations, to determine how such populations can assist the States in serving the unmet needs of underserved populations and culturally- and linguistically-specific populations. Tribes should be involved in these processes where appropriate, but this rule is not intended to encroach upon Tribal sovereignty. States also must consult with and provide for the participation of State Domestic Violence Coalitions and Tribal Coalitions in State planning and coordinate such planning with needs assessments to identify service gaps or problems and develop appropriate responsive plans and programs. Similar coordination and collaboration processes for Tribes and State Domestic Violence Coalitions are expected when feasible and appropriate with deference to Tribal sovereignty as previously indicated.

        (b) A State application must be submitted by the Chief Executive of the State and signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Program Official designated as responsible for the administration of FVPSA. Each application must contain the following information or documentation:

        (1) The name of the State agency, the name and contact information for the Chief Program Official designated as responsible for the administration of funds under FVPSA and coordination of related programs within the State, and the name and contact information for a contact person if different from the Chief Program Official;

        (2) A plan describing in detail how the needs of underserved populations will be met, including:

        (i) Identification of which populations in the State are underserved, a description of those that are being targeted for outreach and services, and a brief explanation of why those populations were selected to receive outreach and services, including how often the State revisits the identification and selection of the populations to be served with FVPSA funding. States must review their State demographics and other relevant metrics at least every three years or explain why this process is unnecessary;

        (ii) A description of the outreach plan, including the domestic violence training to be provided, the means for providing technical assistance and support, and the leadership role played by those representing and serving the underserved populations in question;

        (iii) A description of the specific services to be provided or enhanced, such as new shelters or services, improved access to shelters or services, or new services for underserved populations; and

        (iv) A description of the public information component of the State's outreach program, including the elements of the program that are used to explain domestic violence, the most effective and safe ways to seek help, and tools to identify available resources; and

        (v) A description of the means by which the program will provide meaningful access for limited English proficient individuals and effective communication for individuals with disabilities.

        (3) A description of the process and procedures used to involve the State Domestic Violence Coalition and Tribal Coalition where one exists, knowledgeable individuals, and interested organizations, including those serving or representing underserved populations in the State planning process;

        (4) Documentation of planning, consultation with and participation of the State Domestic Violence Coalition and Tribal Coalition where one exists, in the administration and distribution of FVPSA programs, projects, and grant funds awarded to the State;

        (5) A description of the procedures used to assure an equitable distribution of grants and grant funds within the State and between urban and rural areas. States may use one of the Census definitions of rural or non-metro areas or another State-determined definition. A State-determined definition must be supported by data and be available for public input prior to its adoption. The State must show that the definition selected achieves an equitable distribution of funds within the State and between urban and rural areas. The plan should describe how funding processes and allocations will address the needs of underserved populations as defined in § 1370.2, including Tribal populations, with an emphasis on funding organizations that can meet unique needs including culturally- and linguistically-specific populations. Other Federal, State, local, and private funds may be considered in determining compliance;

        (6) A description of:

        (i) how the State plans to use the grant funds including a State plan developed in consultation with State and Tribal Domestic Violence Coalitions and representatives of underserved populations;

        (ii) the target populations;

        (iii) the number of shelters and programs providing shelter to be funded;

        (iv) the number of non-residential programs to be funded; the services the State will provide; and

        (v) the expected results from the use of the grant funds. To fulfill these requirements, it is critically important that States work with State Domestic Violence Coalitions and Tribes to solicit their feedback on program effectiveness which may include recommendations such as establishing program standards and participating in program monitoring;

        (7) An assurance that the State has a law or procedure to bar an abuser from a shared household or a household of the abused person, which may include eviction laws or procedures, where appropriate;

        (8) An assurance that not less than 70 percent of the funds distributed by a State to sub-recipients shall be distributed to entities for the primary purpose of providing immediate shelter and supportive services to adult and youth victims of family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence, and their dependents, and that not less than 25 percent of the funds distributed by a State to subgrantees/recipients shall be distributed to entities for the purpose of providing supportive services and prevention services (these percentages may overlap with respect to supportive services but are not included in the 5 percent cap applicable to State administrative costs). In the distribution of funds, States will give special emphasis to the support of community-based projects of demonstrated effectiveness that are carried out by primary-purpose domestic violence providers. No grant shall be made under this section to an entity other than a State unless the entity agrees that, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the entity in carrying out the program or project for which the grant is awarded, the entity will make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions in an amount that is not less than $1 for every $5 of Federal funds provided under the grant. The non-Federal contributions required under this paragraph may be in cash or in kind;

        (9) Documentation of policies, procedures and protocols that ensure individual identifiers of client records will not be used when providing statistical data on program activities and program services or in the course of grant monitoring, that the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence, domestic violence, or dating violence prevention or intervention services by any program or entity supported under the FVPSA will be strictly maintained, and the address or location of any shelter supported under the FVPSA will not be made public without the written authorization of the person or persons responsible for the operation of such shelter;

        (10) Such additional agreements, assurances, and information, in such form, and submitted in such manner as the Funding Opportunity Announcement and related program guidance prescribe. Moreover, additional agreements, assurances, and information required by the Funding Opportunity Announcement and other program guidance will include that no requirement for participating in supportive services offered by FVPSA-funded programs may be imposed by grantees or subgrantees for the receipt of emergency shelter and receipt of all supportive services shall be voluntary. Similarly, the receipt of shelter cannot be conditioned on participation in other services, such as, but not limited to counseling, parenting classes, mental health or substance use disorders treatment, pursuit of specific legal remedies, or life skill classes. Additionally, programs cannot impose conditions for admission to shelter by applying inappropriate screening mechanisms, such as criminal background checks, sobriety requirements, requirements to obtain specific legal remedies, or mental health or substance use disorder screenings. An individual's or family's stay in shelter cannot be conditioned upon accepting or participating in services. Based upon the capacity of a FVPSA-funded service provider, victims and their dependents do not need to reside in shelter to receive supportive services. Nothing is these requirements prohibits a shelter operator from adopting reasonable policies and procedures reflecting field-based best practices, to ensure that persons receiving services are not currently engaging in illegal drug use, if that drug use presents a danger to the safety of others, creates an undue hardship for the shelter operator, or causes a fundamental alteration to the operator's services. In the case of an apparent conflict with State, Federal, or Tribal laws, case-by-case determinations will be made by ACF if they are not resolved at the State or Tribal level. In general, when two or more laws apply, a grantee/subgrantee must meet the highest standard for providing programmatic accessibility to victims and their dependents. These provisions are not intended to deny a shelter the ability to manage its services and secure the safety of all shelter residents should, for example, a client become violent or abusive to other clients.

        (c) An application from a Tribe or Tribal Organization must include documentation demonstrating that the governing body of the organization on whose behalf the application is submitted approves the application's submission to ACF for the current FVPSA grant period. Each application must contain the following information or documentation:

        (1) Written Tribal resolutions, meeting minutes from the governing body, and/or letters from the authorizing official reflecting approval of the application's submittal, depending on what is appropriate for the applicant's governance structure. Such documentation must reflect the applicant's authority to submit the application on behalf of members of the Tribes and administer programs and activities pursuant to FVPSA;

        (2) The resolution or equivalent documentation must specify the name(s) of the Tribe(s) on whose behalf the application is submitted and the service areas for the intended grant services;

        (3) Applications from consortia must provide letters of commitment, memoranda of understanding, or their equivalent identifying the primary applicant that is responsible for administering the grant, documenting commitments made by partnering eligible applicants, and describing their roles and responsibilities as partners in the consortia or collaboration;

        (4) A description of the procedures designed to involve knowledgeable individuals and interested organizations in providing services under the FVPSA. For example, knowledgeable individuals and interested organizations may include Tribal officials or social services staff involved in child abuse or family violence prevention, Tribal law enforcement officials, representatives of Tribal or State Domestic Violence Coalitions, and operators of domestic violence shelters and service programs;

        (5) A description of the applicant's operation of and/or capacity to carry out a family violence prevention and services program. This might be demonstrated in ways such as:

        (i) The current operation of a shelter, safe house, or domestic violence prevention program;

        (ii) The establishment of joint or collaborative service agreements with a local public agency or a private, non- profit agency for the operation of family violence prevention and intervention activities or services; or

        (iii) The operation of social services programs as evidenced by receipt of grants or contracts awarded under Indian Child Welfare grants from the Bureau of Indian Affairs; Child Welfare Services grants under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act; or Family Preservation and Family Support grants under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act.

        (6) A description of the services to be provided, how the applicant organization plans to use the grant funds to provide the direct services, to whom the services will be provided, and the expected results of the services;

        (7) An assurance that the Indian Tribe has a law or procedure to bar an abuser from a shared household or a household of the abused person, which may include eviction laws or procedures, where appropriate;

        (8) Documentation of the policies and procedures developed and implemented, including copies of the policies and procedures, to ensure that individual identifiers of client records will not be used when providing statistical data on program activities and program services or in the course of grant monitoring and that the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided domestic violence prevention or intervention services by any FVPSA-supported program will be strictly maintained; and

        (9) Such agreements, assurances, and information, in such form, and submitted in such manner as the Funding Opportunity Announcement and related program guidance prescribe.

        (d) Given the unique needs of victims of trafficking, FVPSA-funded programs are strongly encouraged to safely screen for and identify victims of human trafficking who are also victims or survivors of domestic violence or dating violence and provide services that support their unique needs.
