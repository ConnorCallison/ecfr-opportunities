      (a)  The DOL official(s) responsible for resolution shall promptly evaluate findings and recommendations reported by auditors and the corrective action plan developed by the recipient to determine proper actions in response to audit findings and recommendations. The process of audit resolution includes at a minimum an initial determination, an informal resolution period, and a final determination.

      (1)  After the conclusion of any comment period for audits provided the recipient/contractor, the responsible DOL official(s) shall make an initial determination on the allowability of questioned costs or activities, administrative or systemic findings, and the corrective actions outlined by the recipient. Such determination shall be based on applicable statutes, regulations, administrative directives, or terms and conditions of the grant/contract award instrument.

      (2)  The recipient/contractor shall have a reasonable period of time (as determined by the DOL official(s) responsible for audit resolution) from the date of issuance of the initial determination to informally resolve those matters in which the recipient/contractor disagrees with the decisions of the responsible DOL official(s).

      (3)  After the conclusion of the informal resolution period, the responsible DOL official(s) shall issue a final determination that:

      (i) As appropriate, indicate that efforts to informally resolve matters contained in the initial determination have either been successful or unsuccessful;

      (ii) Lists those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;

      (iii) Lists any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions set forth in the initial determination;

      In the DOL, ordinarily, a management decision is issued within six months of receipt of an audit from the audit liaison of the Office of the Inspector General and is extended an additional six months when the audit contains a finding involving a subrecipient of the pass-through entity being audited. The pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within twelve months of acceptance of the audit report by the FAC. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and should begin corrective action no later than upon receipt of the audit report. (See 2 CFR 200.521(d)).

      In the DOL, the DOL grantor agencies shall determine which of the two appeal options set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section the recipient may use to appeal the final determination of the grant officer. All awards within the same Federal financial assistance program shall follow the same appeal procedure.

      (a) Appeal to the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee, for which the audit was conducted.

      (1)  (i) Request for hearing. Within 21 days of receipt of the grant officer's final determination, the recipient may transmit, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a request for hearing to the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee, as noted in the final determination. A copy must also be sent to the grant officer who signed the final determination.

      (ii)  The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, if issued, and shall specifically state those portions of the final determination upon which review is requested. Those portions of the final determination not specified for review shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.

      (iii)  When no timely request for a hearing is made, the final determination shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor and shall not be subject to further review.

      (2)  The grantor agency shall establish procedures for the conduct of hearings by the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee.

      (3)  The head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee, should render a written decision no later than 90 days after the closing of the record. This decision constitutes final action of the Secretary.

      (b)  (1)  (i)  Within 21 days of receipt of the grant officer's final determination, the recipient may transmit by certified mail, return receipt requested, a request for hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street NW., Suite 400, Washington, DC 20001, with a copy to the grant officer who signed the final determination. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall designate an administrative law judge to hear the appeal.

      (ii)  The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, if issued, and shall specifically state those portions of the final determination upon which review is requested. Those portions of the final determination not specified for review shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.

      (iii)  When no timely request for a hearing is made, the final determination shall constitute final action by the Secretary and shall not be subject to further review.

      (2)  The DOL Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, set forth at 29 CFR part 18, shall govern the conduct of hearings under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (3)  The administrative law judge should render a written decision no later than 90 days after the closing of the record.

      (4)  The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor, unless, within 21 days after receipt of the decision of the administrative law judge, a party dissatisfied with the decision or any part thereof has filed exceptions with the Secretary, specifically identifying the procedure or finding of fact, law, or policy with which exception is taken. Any exceptions not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived. Thereafter, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the decision of the Secretary, unless the Secretary, within 30 days of such filing, has notified the parties that the case has been accepted for review.

      (5)  Any case accepted for review by the Secretary shall be decided within 180 days of such acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the final decision of the Secretary.

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) The Department of Labor's policies and procedures that you must follow are specified in:

    (1) Each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180; and

(The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance ( 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part ( Sec. 2998.220)).

    (b) For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, the Department of Labor's policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.
