### Part 303

**Authority:** Authority: 21 U.S.C. 601-695; 7 CFR 2.18, 2.53.

      § 303.1   Exemptions.

#### § § 303.1

      (a) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to:

      (1) The slaughtering by any individual of livestock of his own raising, and the preparation by him and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such livestock exclusively for use by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees;

      (2) The custom slaughter by any person of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats delivered by the owner thereof for such slaughter, and the preparation by such slaughterer and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such livestock, exclusively for use, in the household of such owner, by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees; nor to the custom preparation by any person of carcasses, parts thereof, meat or meat food products derived from the slaughter by any individual of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats of his own raising or from game animals, delivered by the owner thereof for such custom preparation, and transportation in commerce of such custom prepared articles, exclusively for use in the household of such owner, by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees:  That the following requirements are met by such custom operator;

      (i) Establishments that conduct custom operations must be maintained and operated in accordance with the provisions of §§ 416.1 through 416.6, except for: § 416.2(g)(2) through (6) of this chapter, regarding water reuse and any provisions of part 416 of this chapter relating to inspection or supervision of specified activities or other action by a Program employee. If custom operations are conducted in an official establishment, however, all of the provisions of part 416 of this chapter of shall apply to those operations.

      (ii) If the custom operator prepares or handles any products for sale, they are kept separate and apart from the custom prepared products at all times while the latter are in his custody;

      (iii) The custom prepared products are plainly marked “Not for Sale” as provided in § 316.16 of this subchapter, immediately after being prepared and are kept so identified until delivered to the owner; and

      (iv) If exempted custom slaughtering or other preparation of products is conducted in an official establishment, all facilities and equipment in the official establishment used for such custom operations shall be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they are used for preparing any products for sale.

      (b)(1) The exempted custom prepared products shall be prepared and handled in accordance with the provisions of §§ 318.5, 318.6, 381.300 through 318.311 of this subchapter and § 424.21 of subchapter E, and shall not be adulterated as defined in paragraph 1(m) of the Act. The provisions of §§ 318.5, 318.6, and 318.300 through 318.311 related to inspection or supervision of specified activities or other action by an inspection program employee and the provisions of § 318.6(b)(9) and (10) shall not apply to the preparation and handling of such exempted products.

      (2) The exempted custom prepared products shall comply with the requirements of §§ 316.16 and 317.16 of this subchapter.

      (3) The custom operators claiming exemption under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall keep records, in addition to records otherwise required by part 320 of this subchapter, showing the numbers and kinds of livestock slaughtered on a custom basis, the quantities and types of products prepared on a custom basis, and the names and addresses of the owners of the livestock and products.

      (4) Articles capable of use as human food, resulting from the exempted custom slaughter or other preparation of products shall be promptly denatured or otherwise identified in accordance with § 325.13 of this subchapter and not removed from the establishment where the custom operations are conducted until so identified, unless they are delivered to the owner of the articles for use in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (c) It has been determined that it is impracticable to provide inspection of the preparation of products at establishments in any unorganized Territory at which livestock are slaughtered or their products are prepared for distribution solely within such jurisdiction and that exempting such establishments from requirements of the Act for such inspections under the conditions stated in this section will otherwise facilitate enforcement of the Act. Therefore, such inspection requirements of the Act and of the regulations in this subchapter shall not apply at such establishments if they are operated in accordance with the regulations in part 416, §§ 416.1 through 416.5 of this chapter. However, the Administrator may refuse, withdraw, or modify any exemption under this paragraph when he determines in any specific case in accordance with the applicable rules of practice that such action is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act.

      (d)(1) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and restaurants, when conducted at any retail store or restaurant or similar retail-type establishment for sale in normal retail quantities or service of such articles to consumers at such establishments.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:

      (i) Operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and restaurants are the following:

      () Cutting up, slicing, _a_nd trimming carcasses, halves, quarters, or wholesale cuts into retail cuts such as steaks, chops, and roasts, and freezing such cuts;

      () Grinding and freezing products made from meat;

      () Curing, _c_ooking, smoking, rendering or refining of livestock fat, or other preparation of products, except slaughtering or the retort processing of canned products;

      () Breaking bulk shipments of pro_d_ucts;

      () Wrapping or r_e_wrapping products.

      (ii) Any quantity or product purchased by a consumer from a particular retail supplier shall be deemed to be a normal retail quantity if the quantity so purchased does not in the aggregate exceed one-half carcass. The following amounts of product will be accepted as representing one-half carcass of the species identified:

      (iii) A retail store is any place of business where:

      () The s_a_les of product are made to consumers only;

      () At least 75 percent, in terms of dollar value, of total sales of product represents sales to household consumers and the total dollar value of sales of product to consumers other than household consumers does not exceed the dollar limitation per calendar year set _b_y the Administrator. This dollar limitation is a figure which will automatically be adjusted during the first quarter of each calendar year, upward or downward, whenever the Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, indicates a change in the price of this same volume of product which exceeds $500. Notice of the adjusted dollar limitation will be published in the

      () Only federally or State inspe_c_ted and passed product is handled or used in the preparation of any product, except that product resulting from the custom slaughter or custom preparation of product may be handled or used in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) and (b) of this section but not for sale;

      () No sale of pro_d_uct is made in excess of a normal retail quantity as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;

      () Th_e_ preparation of products for sale to household consumers is limited to traditional and usual operations as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and

      () Th_e_ prep_a_ration o_f_ pro_d_ucts for sale to other than household consumers is limited to traditional and usual operations as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (), (), (), and () of this section. (A retail store at which custom slaughtering or preparation of products is conducted is not there_b_y disqualified from exemption as a retail store under this paragraph (d).)

      (iv)  () A rest_a_urant is any establishment where:

      () Product is prepared only for sale or service in meals or as entrees directly to individual consumers at such establishments;

      () Only federally or State inspected and passed product or such product prepared at a retail store exempted under paragraph (d)(_2_)(iii) of this section is handled or used in the preparation of any product;

      () No sale of product is made in excess of a normal retail quantity as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and

      () The preparation of product is limited to traditional and usual operations as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

      () The definition of a restaurant includes a caterer which delivers or serves product in meals, or as entrees, only to individual consumers and otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph.

      () For purposes of this paragraph, operations _c_onducted at a restaurant central kitchen facility shall be considered as being conducted at a restaurant if the restaurant central kitchen prepares meat or meat food products that are ready to eat when they leave such facility (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to a receiving restaurant by its own employees, without intervening transfer or storage, maintained in a safe, unadulterated condition during transportation, and served in meals or as entrees only to customers at restaurants, or through vending machines, owned or operated by the same person that owns or operates such facility, and which otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph:  That the requirements of §§ 320.1 through 320.4 of this subchapter apply to such facility.  That the exempted facility may be subject to inspection requirements under the Act for as long as the Administrator deems necessary, if the Administrator determines that the sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the processing procedures or methods at the facility are such that any of its meat or meat food products are rendered adulterated. When the Administrator has made such determination and subjected a restaurant central kitchen facility to such inspection requirements, the operator of such facility shall be afforded an opportunity to dispute the Administrator's determination in a hearing pursuant to rules of practice which will be adopted for this proceeding.

      (v) Similar retail-type establishment: Any establishment which is a combination retail store and restaurant; any delicatessen which meets the requirements for a retail store or restaurant as prescribed in paragraphs (d)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section; or other establishment as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

      (vi) Consumer: Any household consumer, hotel, restaurant, or similar institution as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

      (3) Whenever any complaint is received by the Administrator from any person alleging that any retail store claiming exemption under this paragraph (d), in any designated State or organized Territory that is identified under section 205 of the Act (as one that does not have or is not exercising adequate authority with respect to recordkeeping requirements) has been operated in violation of the conditions prescribed in this section for exemption, and the Administrator, upon investigation of the complaint, has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred, he shall so notify the operator of the retail store and afford him reasonable opportunity to present his views informally with respect to the matter. Thereafter, if the Administrator still has reason to believe that such a violation has occurred, and that a requirement that the operator keep records concerning the operations of the retail store would effectuate the purposes of the Act, the Administrator shall order the operator to maintain complete, accurate, and legible records of total monthly purchases and of total monthly sales of meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products, in terms of dollar values of the products involved. Such records shall separately show total sales to household consumers and total sales to other consumers and shall be maintained for the period prescribed in § 320.3 of this subchapter. If the operator maintains copies of bills of lading, receiving and shipping invoices, warehouse receipts, or similar documents which give the information required herein, additional records are not required by this subparagraph.

      (e)(1) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to meat pizzas containing meat food product ingredients which were prepared, inspected, and passed in a cured or cooked form as ready-to-eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed) in compliance with the requirements of the Act and these regulations; and the meat pizzas are to be served in public or private nonprofit institutions, provided that the meat pizzas are ready-to-eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to the receiving institution by employees of the preparing firm, receiving institution, or a food service management company contracted to conduct food service at the public or private nonprofit institution, without intervening transfer or storage.

      (2) The definitions at Chapter 1, 1-102, except 1-102(z) and the provisions of Chapters 2 through 8, except sections 2-102(a) and (b), 2-302(d), 2-403(a), 2-403(c), 2-404, 2-405, 2-407, 2-502 through 2-506, 2-508, 2-509, 4-105, 4-201(c), 4-208, 5-101(a), 5-103, 5-104, 5-202(c), 5-203, and 6-105, part IV, of the Food and Drug Administration's Food Service Sanitation Manual (1976 Recommendations), DHEW Publication No. (FDA) 78-2081, which is incorporated by reference, shall apply to the facilities and operations of businesses claiming this exemption.

      § 303.2   Experimentation: Intensity of inspection coverage.

#### § § 303.2

      (a) Pursuant to the Processed Products Inspection Improvement Act of 1986, Title IV of the Futures Trading Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-641), in establishments preparing products at which inspection under the Act and regulations is required, the frequency with which and the manner in which meat food products made from livestock previously slaughtered in official establishments are examined and inspected by Program employees is to be based on considerations relevant to effective regulation of meat food products and protection of the health and welfare of consumers. In order to test procedures for use in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining whether and, is so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage exceeds that which should be considered necessary pursuant to section 6 of the Act, as amended by section 403(a) of the Futures Trading Act of 1986, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the manner of inspection by Program employees shall be determined on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in accordance with this section.

      (b) The determinations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by the program and shall reflect evaluations of the performance and the characteristics and such establishments.

      (1) In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:

      (i) The history of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the person conducting operations at such establishment or by anyone responsibly connected with the business conducting operations at such establishment, as “responsibly connected” is defined in section 401(g) of the Act,

      (ii) The competence of the person conducting operations at such establishment, as indicated by:

      (A) Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable regulatory requirements,

      (B) Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and consistent manner, and

      (C) Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Program employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and

      (iii) The procedures used in such establishment to control the production process, environment, and resulting product in order to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

      (2) In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:

      (i) The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such establishment,

      (ii) The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at such establishment,

      (iii) The volume of product resulting from each such operation at such establishment,

      (iv) Whether and to what extent slaughter operations also are conducted at such establishment,

      (v) What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act also are prepared at such establishment, and

      (vi) The size of such establishment.

      (c)(1) For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (a) of this section, the frequency of inspection by Program employees of operations other than slaughter may be reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of such establishment described in paragraph (b)(1) indicates that there are:

      (i) No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10 years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and frequency of any such noncompliance), and

      (ii) The competence and control procedures needed to assure and monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

      (2)(i) The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:

      (A) The evaluation of the characteristics of such establishment described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,

      (B) The significance of potential public health consequences of noncompliance, and

      (C) The availability of Program employees.

      (ii) To the extent that such frequency of inspection or other conditions and methods of inspection coverage are identified as conflicting with provisions of the regulations in this subchapter, the Administrator will waive such provisions for the period of experimentation, in accordance with § 303.1(g) of this subchapter.

      § 304.2   Information to be furnished; grant or refusal of inspection.

#### § § 304.2

      (a) FSIS shall give notice in writing to each applicant granted inspection and shall specify in the notice the establishment, including the limits of the establishment's premises, to which the grant pertains.

      (b) The Administrator is authorized to grant inspection upon his determination that the applicant and the establishment are eligible therefor and to refuse to grant inspection at any establishment if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of this part or the regulations in parts 305, 307, and part 416, §§ 416.1 through 416.6 of this chapter or that the applicant has not received approval of labeling and containers to be used at the establishment as required by the regulations in parts 316 and 317. Any application for inspection may be refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.

      (c)(1) Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters in the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (84 Stat. 91), to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency or the Secretary of the Interior to act on a request for certification within a reasonable period (which shall not exceed 1 year after receipt of such request).

      (2) However, certification is not initially required in connection with an application for inspection granted after April 3, 1970, for facilities existing or under construction on April 3, 1970, although certification for such facilities is required to be obtained within the 3-year period immediately following April 3, 1970. Failure to obtain such certification and meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.

      § 307.4   Schedule of operations.

#### § § 307.4

      (a) No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except under the supervision of a Program employee. All slaughtering of animals and preparation of products shall be done with reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.

      (b) A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration. Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than 30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as 5  hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.

      (c) Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 consecutive hours per shift during the basic workweek subject to the provisions of § 307.5:  That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to put on required gear and to walk to a work station; to prepare the work station; to return from a work station and remove required gear; to sharpen knives, if necessary; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously handicap the Department in carrying out its function. These provisions are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as provided in § 318.4(h) of this subchapter.

      (d)(1) Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area supervisor shall take into account the efficient and effective use of inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify daily clock hours of operation and lunch periods for all departments of the establishment requiring inspection.

      (2) Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving an addition or elimination of shifts shall be submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved:  however, minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may be approved by the inspector in charge, if such request is received on the day preceding the day of change.

      (3) Request for inspection service outside an approved work schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service at the start of the following day:  That an inspector may be recalled to his assignment after completion of his daily tour of duty under the provisions of § 307.6(b).

      § 307.7   Safety requirements for electrical stimulating (EST) equipment.

#### § § 307.7

      (a)  Electrical stimulating (EST) equipment is equipment that provides electric shock treatment to carcasses for the purpose of accelerating rigor mortis of facilitating blood removal. These provisions do not apply to electrical equipment used to stun and/or slaughter animals or to facilitate hide removal. Electrical stimulating equipment consists of two separate pieces—the control system and the applicator. The EST control system contains the circuitry to generate pulsed DC or AC voltage for stimulation and is separate from the equipment used to apply the voltage to the carcass. The voltage is applied by inserting a probe that penetrates the carcass or is inserted in the rectum, placing a clamp in the nose, a carcass rub-bar, a conveyor with energized surfaces traveling with the carcass, or any other acceptable method.

      (b) —(1)  Either a bonded grounding conductor shall lead from each section of the carcass rail within the stimulating enclosure to the service ground, or the secondary voltage (stimulating circuit) shall be insulated from the service ground. If the stimulating section of the carcass rail and carcass drive mechanisms are insulated from the service ground then the stimulating rail or the return path shall be electrically bonded to the transformer secondary to isolate the stimulation voltage.

      (2)  Electrical stimulation shall occur in an area that will prevent persons from contacting an energized surface. If the area is surrounded by physical barriers, the enclosure shall be either electrically grounded or it shall be made of materials that do not conduct electricity. The interior of the stimulating area shall be visible from the start switch so the operator can be assured that there is no person, equipment or material present that should not be there prior to starting the stimulating sequence. If light or sound beam sensors form the enclosure, the stimulating equipment shall be automatically shut off when the sensor signals are broken.

      (3)  The following warning devices or signals shall be installed at each opening to the stimulating area through which a person would normally enter:

      (i) A red light that flashes distinctly during the operating cycle of the stimulating equipment.

      (ii) An ANSI Z53.1-Color Code sign reading (a) “Danger Electrical Hazard” for stimulating voltage below 50 or (b) “Danger High Voltage” for stimulating voltage above 50.

      (iii) An emergency stop button.

      (4)  If a warning horn or bell is installed, the signal shall be audible above background noises in the vicinity, and it shall sound for at least 1 second before each manual stimulation or before the carcass chain is started in an automatic system.

      (c) —(1)  Only persons who have received safety instruction by the equipment manufacturer or designee may operate electrical stimulating equipment.

      (2)  To prevent an electrical shock to personnel, the electricity supplied to the stimulating surfaces shall be locked-off when cleaning, mechanical inspection, maintenance or testing are performed.

      (3)  To prevent an electrical shock, personnel shall not spray streams of water on energized carcasses or on energized stimulating surfaces.

      (d)  (1) Stimulating probes or clamps shall be stored in a sanitary container which is insulated with a material approved by the Administrator.

      (2) The electric wires attached to a clamp or probe shall not allow for contact between the probe or clamp and an electrical ground and shall not extend outside the enclosure.

#### § § 309.2

      (a) Any livestock which, on ante-mortem inspection, do not clearly show, but are suspected of being affected with any disease or condition that, under part 311 of this subchapter, may cause condemnation of the carcass on post-mortem inspection, and any livestock which show, on ante-mortem inspection, any disease or condition that, under part 311 of this subchapter would cause condemnation of only part of the carcass on post-mortem inspection, shall be so handled as to retain its identity as a suspect until it is given final post-mortem inspection, when the carcass shall be marked and disposed of as provided in parts 310 and 311 of this subchapter, or until it is disposed of as otherwise provided in this part.

      (b) All seriously crippled animals and non-ambulatory disabled livestock shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.1 of this subchapter unless they are required to be classed as condemned under § 309.3. Non-ambulatory disabled livestock are livestock that cannot rise from a recumbent position or that cannot walk, including, but not limited to, those with broken appendages, severed tendons or ligaments, nerve paralysis, fractured vertebral column, or metabolic conditions.

      (c) Livestock which have reacted to a test for leptospirosis, or anaplasmosis, but which show no symptoms of the disease, shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.10 of this subchapter.

      (d) Livestock which are known to have reacted to the tuberculin test shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.2 of this subchapter, except that livestock bearing an official “USDA Reactor” or similar State reactor tag shall not be tagged as U.S. Suspects.

      (e) Any cattle found on ante-mortem inspection to be affected with epithelioma of the eye or of the orbital region to a lesser extent than as described in § 309.6 shall be identified as a U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.12 of this subchapter.

      (g) Any livestock suspected of being affected with anasarca may be set apart and held for treatment under Program or other responsible official supervision approved by the area supervisor. If at the expiration of the treatment period the livestock upon examination is found to be free from disease, it may be released for any purpose. Otherwise, it shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.8 of this subchapter or condemned and disposed of as provided in § 309.8, whichever is appropriate.

      (h) All hogs suspected on ante-mortem inspection of being affected with swine erysipelas shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.5 of this subchapter or paragraph (i) of this section.

      (i) A hog suspected of being affected with swine erysipelas may be set apart and held for treatment under Program or other responsible official supervision approved by the area supervisor. If at the expiration of the treatment period the animal upon examination is found to be free from disease, it may be released for any purpose. Otherwise, it shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.5 of this subchapter, or condemned and disposed of as provided in § 309.13, whichever is appropriate.

      (j) Any livestock which is affected with vesicular exanthema or vesicular stomatitis, but which has recovered to the extent that the lesions are in process of healing, the temperature is within normal range, and the livestock shows a return to normal appetite and activity, shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.32 of this subchapter, except that if desired, such livestock may be set apart and held under supervision of a Program employee or other official designated by the area supervisor for treatment. If the livestock is set aside for treatment, the U.S. Suspect identification device will be removed by a Program employee, following such treatment, if the livestock is found to be free from any such disease. Such livestock found to be free from any such disease may be released for slaughter or for purposes other than slaughter, provided that in the latter instance, the operator of the official establishment or the owner of the animal shall first obtain permission from the local, State, or Federal livestock sanitary official having jurisdiction over the movement of such livestock.

      (k) Livestock which are offered for ante-mortem inspection under this part, and which are regarded by the inspector as immature, shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and, if slaughtered, the disposition of their carcasses shall be determined by the post-mortem findings in connection with the ante-mortem conditions. If not slaughtered as suspects, such livestock shall be held under supervision of a Program employee or other official designated by the area supervisor, and after sufficient development may be released for slaughter or may be released for any other purpose, provided they have not been exposed to any infectious or contagious disease. If such exposure occurs, permission should be obtained from the nearest Veterinary Services unit of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to release of such livestock.

    PART 310—POST-MORTEM INSPECTION

### Part 310

**Authority:** Authority: 21 U.S.C. 601-695; 7 CFR 2.18, 2.53.

**Source:** Source: 35 FR 15567, Oct. 3, 1970, unless otherwise noted.

      § 310.1   Extent and time of post-mortem inspection; post-mortem inspection staffing standards.

#### § § 310.1

      (a) A careful post-mortem examination and inspection shall be made of the carcasses and parts thereof of all livestock slaughtered at official establishments. Such inspection and examination shall be made at the time of slaughter unless, because of unusual circumstances, prior arrangements acceptable to the Administrator have been made in specific cases by the circuit supervisor for making such inspection and examination at a later time.

      (b)(1) The staffing standards on the basis of the number of carcasses to be inspected per hour are outlined in the following tables. Standards for multiple inspector lines are based on inspectors rotating through the different types of inspection stations during each shift to equalize the workload. The inspector in charge shall have the authority to require the establishment to reduce slaughter line speeds where, in his judgment, the inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed at the current line speed because of particular deficiencies in carcass preparation and presentation by the plant at the higher speed, or because the health condition of the particular animals indicates a need for more extensive inspection.

      (2)  For all cattle staffing standards, an “a” in the “Number of Inspectors by Stations” column means that one inspector performs the entire inspection procedure and a “b” means that one inspector performs the head and lower carcass inspection and a second inspector performs the viscera and upper carcass inspection.

      (i) Inspection Using the Viscera Truck.

      (A) Rules for determining adjusted maximum slaughter rates for single-inspector kills considering walking distance according to the table in this subdivision: Determine the distances the inspector actually walks between the points shown in columns 2 through 14 of the following table. For each column, determine the deduction figure opposite the appropriate number of feet in column 1. Compute the total of the deduction figures for columns 2 through 14. The adjusted maximum rate is the maximum rate in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus total of the deduction figures. If the resultant number is not a whole number, it must be rounded off to the next  whole number.

      (B) Rules for determining adjusted maximum slaughter rates for two-inspector kills considering walking distance according to the table in this subdivision: Determine the distances the inspectors actually walk between the points shown in columns 2 through 9 of the following table. Column 9 is used only if the condemned brands and tags the viscera inspector uses are kept at a location other than at the washbasin-sterilizer. For each column, determine the deduction figure opposite the appropriate number of feet in column 1. Compute the total of the deduction figures for columns 2 through 9. Divide this total by 2. The adjusted maximum rate is the maximum rate in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus the number calculated above. If the resultant number is not a whole number, it must be rounded off to the next  whole number.

      (ii) Inspection Using Viscera Table, Tongue-In Presentation of Heads.

      (iii) Inspection Using Viscera Table, Tongue-Out Presentation of Heads.

      (3)  There are two systems of post-mortem inspection: The New Swine Slaughter Inspection System (NSIS), which may be used for market hogs, and the traditional inspection system, which may be used for all swine.

      (i) The NSIS may be used for market hogs if the official establishment requests to use it and meets or agrees to meet the requirements in 9 CFR 309.19 and § 310.26. The Administrator may permit establishments that slaughter classes of swine other than market hogs to use NSIS under a waiver from the provisions in 9 CFR 309.19 and § 310.26 as provided by 9 CFR 303.1(h). The Administrator also may permit establishments that slaughter both market hogs and other classes of swine to slaughter the market hogs under NSIS and slaughter the other classes of swine under traditional inspection.

      (ii) Traditional inspection shall be used for swine when NSIS is not used. The following inspection staffing standards are applicable to swine slaughter configurations operating under traditional inspection when NSIS is not used. The inspection standards for all slaughter lines are based upon the observation rather than palpation, at the viscera inspection station, of the spleen, liver, heart, lungs, and mediastinal lymph nodes. In addition, for one- and two-inspector lines under traditional inspection, the standards are based upon the distance walked (in feet) by the inspector between work stations; and for three or more inspector slaughter lines, upon the use of a mirror, as described in § 307.2(m)(6) of this chapter, at the carcass inspection station. Although not required in a one- or two-inspector slaughter configuration, except in certain cases as determined by the inspection service, if a mirror is used, it must comply with the requirements of § 307.2(m)(6).

      § 310.2   Identification of carcass with certain severed parts thereof and with animal from which derived.

#### § § 310.2

      (a) The head, tail, tongue, thymus gland, and all viscera of each slaughtered animal, and all blood and other parts of such animal to be used in the preparation of meat food products or medical products, shall be handled in such a manner as to identify them with the rest of the carcass and as being derived from the particular animal involved, until the post-mortem examination of the carcass and parts thereof has been completed. Such handling shall include the retention of ear tags, backtags, implants, and other identifying devices affixed to the animal, in such a way to relate them to the carcass until the post-mortem examination has been completed.

      (b) The official State-Federal Department backtag on any carcass shall:

      (1)(i) Be removed from the hide of the animal by an establishment employee and placed in a clear plastic bag. The bag containing the tag shall be affixed to the corresponding carcass.

      (ii) The bag containing the tag shall be removed from the carcass by an establishment employee and presented with the viscera to the Program inspector at the point where such inspector conducts the viscera inspection.

      (2)(i) Brucellosis and tuberculosis ear tags, herd identification ear tags, sales tags, ear bangles, and similar identification devices shall be removed from the animal's hide or ear by an establishment employee and shall be placed in a clear plastic bag and affixed to the corresponding carcass.

      (ii) The bag containing the tag shall be removed from the carcass by an establishment employee and presented with the viscera to the Program inspector at the point where such inspector conducts the viscera inspection.

      (3) In cases where both types of devices described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are present on the same animal, both types may be placed in the same plastic bag or in two separate bags.

      (4) The circuit supervisor may allow the use of any alternate method proposed by the operator of an official establishment for handling the type of devices described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if such alternate method would provide a ready means of identifying a specific carcass with the corresponding devices by a Program inspector during the post-mortem inspection.

      (5) Disposition and use of identifying devices.

      (i) The official State-Federal Department backtags will be collected by a Program inspector and used to obtain traceback information necessary for proper disposition of the animal or carcass and otherwise handled according to instructions issued to the inspectors.

      (ii) The devices described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be collected by the Program inspector when required to obtain traceback information necessary for proper disposition of the animal or carcass and for controlling the slaughter of reactor animals. Devices not collected for these purposes shall be discarded after the post-mortem examination is complete.

      (6) Plastic bags used by the establishment for collecting identifying devices will be furnished by the Department.

      § 310.3   Carcasses and parts in certain instances to be retained.

#### § § 310.3

      Each carcass, including all detached organs and other parts, in which any lesion or other condition is found that might render the meat or any part unfit for food purposes, or otherwise adulterated, and which for that reason would require a subsequent inspection, shall be retained by the Program employee at the time of inspection. The identity of every such retained carcass, detached organ, or other part shall be maintained until the final inspection has been completed. Retained carcasses shall not be washed or trimmed unless authorized by the Program employee.

      § 310.4   Identification of carcasses and parts; tagging.

#### § § 310.4

      Such devices and methods as may be approved by the Administrator may be used for the temporary identification of retained carcasses, organs, and other parts. In all cases, the identification shall be further established by affixing “U.S. Retained” tags as soon as practicable and before final inspection. These tags shall not be removed except by a Program employee.

      § 310.5   Condemned carcasses and parts to be so marked; tanking; separation.

#### § § 310.5

      Each carcass or part which is found on final inspection to be unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise adulterated shall be conspicuously marked, on the surface tissues thereof, by a Program employee at the time of inspection, as “U.S. Inspected and Condemned.” Condemned detached organs and other parts of such character that they cannot be so marked shall be placed immediately in trucks or receptacles which shall be kept plainly marked “U.S. Condemned,” in letters not less than 2 inches high. All condemned carcasses and parts shall remain in the custody of a Program employee and shall be disposed of as required in the regulations in part 314 of this subchapter at or before the close of the day on which they are condemned.

      § 310.6   Carcasses and parts passed for cooking; marking.

#### § § 310.6

      Carcasses and parts passed for cooking shall be marked conspicuously on the surface tissues thereof by a Program employee at the time of inspection, “U.S. Passed for Cooking.” All such carcasses and parts shall be cooked in accordance with part 315 of this subchapter, and until so cooked shall remain in the custody of a Program employee.

      § 310.7   Removal of spermatic cords, pizzles and preputial diverticuli.

#### § § 310.7

      Spermatic cords and pizzles shall be removed from all carcasses. Preputial diverticuli shall be removed from hog carcasses.

      § 310.8   Passing and marking of carcasses and parts.

#### § § 310.8

      Carcasses and parts found to be sound, healthful, wholesome, and otherwise not adulterated shall be passed and marked as provided in part 316 of this subchapter. In all cases where carcasses showing localized lesions are passed for food or for cooking and “U.S. Retained” tags are attached to the carcasses, the affected tissues shall be removed and condemned before the tags are removed. “U.S. Retained” tags shall be removed only by a Program employee.

      § 310.9   Anthrax; carcasses not to be eviscerated; disposition of affected carcasses; hides, hoofs, horns, hair, viscera and contents, and fat; handling of blood and scalding vat water; general cleanup and disinfection.

#### § § 310.9

      (a) Carcasses found before evisceration to be affected with anthrax shall not be eviscerated but shall be retained, condemned, and immediately tanked or otherwise disposed of as provided in part 314 of this subchapter.

      (b) All carcasses and all parts, including hides, hoofs, horns, hair, viscera and contents, blood, and fat of any livestock found to be affected with anthrax shall be condemned and immediately disposed of as provided in part 314 of this subchapter, except that the blood may be handled through the usual blood cooking and drying equipment.

      (c) Any part of any carcass that is contaminated with anthrax-infected material through contact with soiled instruments or otherwise shall be immediately condemned and disposed of as provided in part 314 of this subchapter.

      (d) The scalding vat water through which hog carcasses affected with anthrax have passed shall be immediately drained into the sewer and all parts of the scalding vat shall be cleaned and disinfected as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (e)(1) That portion of the slaughtering department, including the bleeding area, scalding vat, gambrelling bench, floors, walls, posts, platforms, saws, cleavers, knives, and hooks, as well as employees' boots and aprons, contaminated through contact with anthrax-infected material, shall, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section be cleaned immediately and disinfected with one of the following disinfectants or other disinfectant   approved specifically for this purpose by the Administrator:

      (i) A 5 percent solution of sodium hydroxide or commercial lye containing at least 94 percent of sodium hydroxide. The solution shall be freshly prepared immediately before use by dissolving 2  pounds of sodium hydroxide or lye in 5  gallons of hot water and shall be applied as near scalding hot as possible to be most effective. (Owing to the extremely caustic nature of sodium hydroxide solution, precautionary measures such as the wearing of rubber gloves and boots to protect the hands and feet, and goggles to protect the eyes, should be taken by those engaged in the disinfection process. It is also advisable to have an acid solution, such as vinegar, in readiness in case any of the sodium hydroxide solution should come in contact with any part of the body.)

      (ii) A solution of sodium hypochlorite containing approximately one-half of 1 percent (5,000 parts per million) of available chlorine. The solution shall be freshly prepared.

      (iii) When a disinfectant solution has been applied to equipment which will afterwards contact product, the equipment shall be rinsed with clean water before such contact.

      (2) In case anthrax infection is found in the hog slaughtering department, an immediate preliminary disinfection shall be made from the head-dropper's station to the point where the disease is detected and the affected carcasses shall be cut down from the rail and removed from the room. Upon completion of the slaughtering of the lot of hogs of which the anthrax-infected animals were a part, slaughtering operations shall cease, and a thorough cleanup and disinfection shall be made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the slaughter of the lot has not been completed by the close of the day on which anthrax was detected, the cleanup and disinfection shall not be deferred beyond the close of that day.

      (3) The first and indispensable precautionary step for persons who have handled anthrax material is thorough cleansing of the hands and arms with liquid soap and running hot water. It is important that this step be taken immediately after exposure, before vegetative anthrax organisms have had time to form spores. In the cleansing, a brush or other appropriate appliance shall be used to insure the removal of all contaminating material from under and about the fingernails. This process of cleansing is most effective when performed in repeated cycles of lathering and rinsing rather than in spending the same amount of time in scrubbing with a single lathering. After the hands have been cleansed thoroughly and rinsed free of soap, they may, if desired, be immersed for about 1 minute in a 1:1,000 solution of bichloride of mercury, followed by thorough rinsing in clean running water. Supplies of bichloride of mercury for the purpose must be held in the custody of the veterinary medical officer. (As a precautionary measure, all persons exposed to anthrax infection should report promptly any suspicious condition (sore or carbuncle) or symptom to a physician, in order that anti-anthrax serum or other treatment may be administered as indicated.)

      § 310.13   Inflating carcasses or parts thereof; transferring caul or other fat.

#### § § 310.13

      (a) Establishments that slaughter livestock and prepare livestock carcasses and parts may inflate carcasses or parts of carcasses with air if they develop, implement, and maintain controls to ensure that the air inflation procedure does not cause insanitary conditions or adulterate product. Establishments shall incorporate these controls into their HACCP plans or Sanitation SOPs or other prerequisite programs.

      (b)(1) Transferring the caul or other fat from a fat to a lean carcass is prohibited.

      (2) Injecting compressed air into the skulls of cattle in conjunction with a captive bolt stunner to hold the animal still for dressing operations is prohibited.

#### § § 310.17

      (a) Lactating mammary glands and diseased mammary glands of cattle, sheep, swine, and goats shall be removed without opening the milk ducts or sinuses. If pus or other objectionable material is permitted to come in contact with the carcass, the parts of the carcass thus contaminated shall be removed and condemned.

      (b) Nonlactating cow udders may be saved for food purposes provided suitable facilities for handling and inspecting them are provided. Examination of udders by palpation shall be done by a Program employee. When necessary, in the judgment of the Program employee for adequate inspection, the official establishment employees shall incise udders in sections no greater than 2 inches in thickness. All udders showing disease lesions shall be condemned by a Program employee. Each udder shall be properly identified with its respective carcass and kept separate and apart from other udders until its disposal has been accomplished in accordance with the provisions of part 311 of this subchapter.

#### § § 310.18

      (a) Carcasses, organs, and other parts shall be handled in a sanitary manner to prevent contamination with fecal material, urine, bile, hair, dirt, or foreign matter; however, if contamination occurs, it shall be promptly removed in a manner satisfactory to the inspector.

      (b) Brains, cheek meat, and head trimmings from animals stunned by lead, sponge iron, or frangible bullets shall not be saved for use as human food but shall be handled as described in § 314.1 or § 314.3 of this subchapter.

      (c) Official swine slaughter establishments must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to prevent contamination of carcasses and parts by enteric pathogens, and visible fecal material, ingesta, and milk contamination throughout the entire slaughter and dressing operation. Establishments must incorporate these procedures into their HACCP plans, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite programs. These procedures must include sampling and analysis for microbial organisms in accordance with the sampling location and frequency requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section to monitor their ability to maintain process control.

      (1)  Official swine slaughter establishments, except for very low-volume establishments, must collect and analyze carcass samples for microbial organisms at the pre-evisceration and post-chill points in the process. Establishments that slaughter more than one type of livestock must test the type of livestock slaughtered in the greatest number. Establishments that bone their products before chilling ( hot-boned products) must collect and analyze samples at the pre-evisceration point in the process and after the final wash instead of at post-chill. Very low-volume establishments must collect and analyze samples for microbial organisms at the post-chill point in the process. All swine establishments must sponge or excise tissue from the ham, belly, and jowl areas.

      (i) Very low-volume establishments annually slaughter no more than 20,000 swine, or a combination of swine and other livestock not exceeding 6,000 cattle and 20,000 total of all livestock.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (2)  Establishments, except for very low-volume establishments as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, must collect and analyze samples at a frequency proportional to the establishment's volume of production at the following rates:

      (i) Establishments, except for very low-volume establishments as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, must collect and analyze samples at a frequency of once per 1,000 carcasses, but a minimum of once during each week of operation.

      (ii) Very low-volume establishments as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must collect and analyze samples at least once during each week of operation starting June 1 of every year. If, after consecutively collecting 13 weekly samples, very low-volume establishments can demonstrate that they are effectively maintaining process control, they may modify their sampling plans.

      (iii) Establishments must maintain accurate records of all test results and retain these records as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (d) Official swine slaughter establishments must maintain daily records sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the procedures required under this section. Records required by this section may be maintained on computers if the establishment implements appropriate controls to ensure the integrity of the electronic data. Records required by this section must be maintained for at least one year and must be accessible to FSIS.

      (a) Calf carcasses from animals suspected of containing biological residues under § 309.16(d) of this subchapter shall, on post-mortem inspection, be handled in accordance with the provisions of this section.

      (b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

      (1)  A calf up to 3 weeks of age or up to 150 pounds.

      (2)  A calf that the producer and all other subsequent custodians of the calf certify in writing has not been treated with any animal drug while in his or her custody or has been treated with one or more drugs in accordance with FDA approved label directions while in his or her custody and has been withheld from slaughter for the period(s) of time specified by those label directions.

      (3)  A carcass that an inspector determines shows no lesions of disease or signs of disease treatment at post-mortem inspection

      (4)  The owner of the calf at the time of its birth.

      (5)  A calf carcass that an inspector on post-mortem inspection determines has either signs of disease treatment or lesions of disease or was from an animal identified as sick on ante-mortem.

      (6)  Sign of treatment of a disease is indicated by leakage around jugular veins, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection lesions, or discoloration from particles or oral treatment in any part of the digestive tract.

      (7)  An inspector of the Program that has obtained a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree which is recognized by the Program.

      (c)  The inspector shall perform a swab bioassay test   on:

      (1) Any carcass from a calf tagged as “U.S. Suspect” at the time of ante-mortem inspection, except that calves whose carcasses are condemned for pathology shall not be tested for drug residues.

      (2) Any carcass which he/she finds has either lesions of disease which is not condemned because of these lesions or a sign of treatment of disease at the time of post-mortem inspection,

      (3) Any carcass of a calf from a producer whose calf or calves have previously been condemned for residues as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, and

      (4) Carcasses from healthy-appearing certified and noncertified calves, as determined by the veterinary medical officer during ante-mortem inspection, will be selected for testing as set forth below:

      (d)

      (1) The inspector shall test all carcasses as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) Upon initiation of this program at an establishment, the inspector shall begin the testing rate for carcasses from healthy-appearing certified and noncertified calves at Level D as prescribed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The inspector shall increase the testing rate to the next higher level the following business day when three carcasses in 100 or less consecutively tested show a positive test result for a drug residue. The inspector shall decrease it to the next lower level when no more than two calves show a positive test result for a drug residue in either 500 calves consecutively tested or all calves tested over a 60 working day period.

      (3) Test results shall be determined by the veterinary medical officer.

      (4) The establishment may designate one or more of its employees to aid the inspector in performing the swab bioassay test under the supervision of the veterinary medical officer who shall interpret the results, maintain animal identification with the test unit, and ensure integrity of the testing program.

      (5) All carcasses and parts thereof from calves selected for testing shall be retained until all test results are complete.

      (6) The veterinary medical officer shall condemn all carcasses and parts thereof for which there are positive test results and release for human consumption all carcasses and parts thereof for which there are negative test results.

      (7) If there is a positive test result, subsequent calves from the producer of the calf shall be tested in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. These test results will not be included in computations to determine an establishment's compliance record.

      (8) The veterinary medical officer may reduce inspection line rates when, in his/her judgment, the prescribed testing cannot be adequately performed within the time available because the establishment's compliance history dictates a need for extensive testing.

      (e)  The inspector shall perform a swab bioassay test on all carcasses of all calves in the group. The veterinary medical officer shall determine the test results and shall condemn any carcass and parts thereof for which there is a positive test result and pass for human consumption any such carcass and parts thereof for which there is a negative test result. All subsequent calves from the same producer which has previously sold or delivered to official establishments any carcass that was condemned because of drug residues must be tested according to this paragraph until five consecutive animals test completely free of animal drug residues.

      (f) If the owner or operator of an official establishment disagrees with the veterinary medical officer's disposition of carcasses and parts thereof, the owner or operator may appeal as provided in section 306.5 of this chapter.

      § 310.22   Specified risk materials from cattle and their handling and disposition.

#### § § 310.22

      (a) The following materials from cattle are specified risk materials, except when they are from cattle from a country that can demonstrate that its bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk status can reasonable be expected to provide the same level of protection from human exposure to the BSE agent as prohibiting specified risk materials for use as human food does in the United States:

      (1) The brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column (excluding the vertebrae of the tail, the transverse processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and the wings of the sacrum), and dorsal root ganglia from cattle 30 months of age and older and

      (2) The distal ileum of the small intestine and the tonsils from all cattle.

      (b) Specified risk materials are inedible and prohibited for use as human food.

      (c) Specified risk materials must be removed from the carcasses of cattle, segregated from edible materials, and disposed of in accordance with § 314.1 or § 314.3 of this subchapter. The spinal cord from cattle 30 months of age and older must be removed from the carcass at the establishment where the animal was slaughtered.

      (d)  (1) The small intestine from all cattle may be used for human food if:

      (i) It is derived from cattle that were inspected and passed in an official establishment in the United States or in a certified foreign establishment in a country eligible to export meat and meat products to the United States under 9 CFR 327.2(b) and it is otherwise eligible for importation under 9 CFR 327.1(b), and

      (ii) The distal ileum is removed by a procedure that removes at least 80 inches of the uncoiled and trimmed small intestine as measured from the ceco-colic junction and progressing proximally towards the jejunum or by a procedure that the establishment demonstrates is effective in ensuring complete removal of the distal ileum.

      (iii) If the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section are not met, the entire small intestine must be removed from the carcass, segregated from edible materials, and disposed of in accordance with §§ 314.1 or 314.3 of this subchapter.

      (2) The requirements in paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to materials from cattle from countries that can demonstrate that their BSE risk status can reasonably be expected to provide the same level of protection from human exposure to the BSE agent as prohibiting specified risk materials for use as human food does in the United States.

      (e)  (1) Establishments that slaughter cattle and establishments that process the carcasses or parts of cattle must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials. These procedures must address potential contamination of edible materials with specified risk materials before, during, and after entry into the establishment. Establishments must incorporate their procedures for the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials into their HACCP plans or Sanitation SOPs or other prerequisite programs.

      (2) Establishments that slaughter cattle and establishments that process the carcasses or parts of cattle must take appropriate corrective action when either the establishment or FSIS determines that the establishment's procedures for the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials, or the implementation or maintenance of these procedures, have failed to ensure that specified risk materials are adequately and effectively removed from the carcasses of cattle, segregated from edible materials, and disposed of in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) Establishments that slaughter cattle and establishments that process the carcasses or parts of cattle must routinely evaluate the effectiveness of their procedures for the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials in preventing the use of these materials for human food and must revise the procedures as necessary whenever any changes occur that could affect the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials.

      (4)  (i) Establishments that slaughter cattle and establishments that process the carcasses or parts of cattle must maintain daily records sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the procedures for the removal, segregation, and disposition of the materials listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and any corrective actions taken.

      (ii) Records required by this section may be maintained on computers provided that the establishment implements appropriate controls to ensure the integrity of the electronic data.

      (iii) Records required by this section must be retained for at least one year and must be accessible to FSIS. All such records must be maintained at the official establishment for 48 hours following completion, after which they may be maintained off-site provided such records can be made available to FSIS within 24 hours of request.

      (f)  (1) If an establishment that slaughters cattle, or that processes the carcasses or parts from cattle, does not segregate the carcasses and parts from cattle 30 months of age and older from the carcasses and parts from cattle younger than 30 months during processing operations it must:

      (i) Use dedicated equipment to cut through specified risk materials; or

      (ii) Clean and sanitize equipment used to cut through specified risk materials before the equipment is used on carcasses or parts from cattle younger than 30 months of age.

      (2) If an establishments that slaughters cattle, or that process the carcasses or parts from cattle, segregates the carcasses and parts of cattle 30 months of age and older from cattle younger than 30 months of age during processing operations, and processes the carcasses or parts from the cattle younger than 30 months first, it may use routine operational sanitation procedures on equipment used to cut through specified risk materials.

      (g) Slaughter establishments may ship beef carcasses or parts that contain vertebral columns from cattle 30 months of age and older to another federally-inspected establishment for further processing if the establishment shipping these materials:

      (1) Maintains control of the carcasses or parts while they are in transit or ensures that the carcasses or parts move under FSIS control;

      (2) Ensures that the carcasses or parts are accompanied by documentation that clearly states that the carcasses or parts contain vertebral columns from cattle that were 30 months of age and older at the time of slaughter;

      (3) Maintains records that identify the official establishment that received the carcasses or parts;

      (4) Maintains records that verify that the official establishment that received the carcasses or parts removed the portions of the vertebral column designated as specified risk materials in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and disposed of them in accordance with § 314.1 or § 314.3 of this subchapter.

      (h) The materials listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be deemed to be from cattle 30 months of age and older unless the establishment can demonstrate through documentation that the materials are from an animal that was younger than 30 months of age at the time of slaughter.

#### § § 310.24

      § 310.25   Contamination with microorganisms; process control verification criteria and testing; pathogen reduction standards.

#### § § 310.25

      (a) Criteria for verifying process control;  testing. (1) Each official establishment that slaughters livestock must test for  Biotype 1 () Establishments that slaughter more than one type of livestock or both livestock and poultry, shall test the type of livestock or poultry slaughtered in the greatest number. The establishment shall:

      (i) Collect samples in accordance with the sampling techniques, methodology, and frequency requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

      (ii) Obtain analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

      (iii) Maintain records of such analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      (2) Sampling requirements.

      (i)  Each establishment shall prepare written specimen collection procedures which shall identify employees designated to collect samples, and shall address location(s) of sampling, how sampling randomness is achieved, and handling of the sample to ensure sample integrity. The written procedure shall be made available to FSIS upon request.

      (ii)  The establishment must collect samples from all chilled livestock carcasses, except those boned before chilling (hot-boned), which must be sampled after the final wash. Samples must be collected in the following manner;

      (A) For cattle, establishments must sponge or excise tissue from the flank, brisket and rump, except for hide-on calves, in which case establishments must take samples by sponging from inside the flank, inside the brisket, and inside the rump.

      (B) For sheep, goat, horse, mule, or other equine carcasses, establishments must sponge from the flank, brisket and rump, except for hide-on carcasses, in which case establishments must take samples by sponging from inside the flank, inside the brisket, and inside the rump.

      (iii)  Slaughter establishments, except very low volume establishments as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, must take samples at a frequency proportional to the volume of production at the following rates:

      (A) Cattle, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and other equines: 1 test per 300 carcasses, but, a minimum of one sample during each week of operation.

      (iv)  An establishment operating under a validated HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.2(b) of this chapter may substitute an alternative frequency for the frequency of sampling required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section if,

      (A) The alternative is an integral part of the establishment's verification procedures for its HACCP plan and,

      (B) FSIS does not determine, and notify the establishment in writing, that the alternative frequency is inadequate to verify the effectiveness of the establishment's processing controls.

      (v)  (A) Very low volume establishments annually slaughter no more than 6,000 cattle, 6,000 sheep, 6,000 goats, 6,000 horses, mules or other equines, or a combination of livestock not exceeding 6,000 cattle and 20,000 total of all livestock. Very low volume establishments that collect samples by sponging shall collect at least one sample per week, starting the first full week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until June 1 of the following year or until 13 samples have been collected, whichever comes first. Very low volume establishments collecting samples by excising tissue from carcasses shall collect one sample per week, starting the first full week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until one series of 13 tests meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.

      (B) Upon the establishment's meeting requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section, weekly sampling and testing is optional, unless changes are made in establishment facilities, equipment, personnel or procedures that may affect the adequacy of existing process control measures, as determined by the establishment or FSIS. FSIS determinations that changes have been made requiring resumption of weekly testing shall be provided to the establishment in writing.

      (3)  Laboratories may use any quantitative method for analysis of  that is approved as an AOAC Official Method of the AOAC International (formerly the Association of Official Analytical Chemists)   or approved and published by a scientific body and based on the results of a collaborative trial conducted in accordance with an internationally recognized protocol on collaborative trials and compared against the three tube Most Probable Number (MPN) method and agreeing with the 95 percent upper and lower confidence limit of the appropriate MPN index.

      (4)  The establishment shall maintain accurate records of all test results, in terms of CFU/cm  of surface area sponged or excised. Results shall be recorded onto a process control chart or table showing at least the most recent 13 test results, by type of livestock slaughtered. Records shall be retained at the establishment for a period of 12 months and shall be made available to FSIS upon request.

      (5)  (i) An establishment excising samples from carcasses is operating within the criteria when the most recent  test result does not exceed the upper limit (M), and the number of samples, if any, testing positive at levels above (m) is three or fewer out of the most recent 13 samples (n) taken, as follows:

      (ii) Establishments sponging carcasses shall evaluate  test results using statistical process control techniques.

      (6)  Test results that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are an indication that the establishment may not be maintaining process controls sufficient to prevent fecal contamination. FSIS shall take further action as appropriate to ensure that all applicable provisions of the law are being met.

      (7)  Inspection shall be suspended in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for such proceedings upon a finding by FSIS that one or more provisions of paragraphs (a) (1)-(4) of this section have not been complied with and written notice of same has been provided to the establishment.

      (b) Pathogen reduction performance standard; —(1)  An establishment's raw meat products, when sampled and tested by FSIS for  as set forth in this section, may not test positive for  at a rate exceeding the applicable national pathogen reduction performance standard, as provided in Table 1 to this paragraph:

      (2)  FSIS will sample and test raw meat products in an individual establishment on an unannounced basis to determine prevalence of  in such products to determine compliance with the standard. The frequency and timing of such testing will be based on the establishment's previous test results and other information concerning the establishment's performance. In an establishment producing more than one class of product subject to the pathogen reduction standard, FSIS may sample any or all such classes of products.

      (3)  When FSIS determines that an establishment has not met the performance standard:

      (i) The establishment shall take immediate action to meet the standard.

      (ii) If the establishment fails to meet the standard on the next series of compliance tests for that product, the establishment shall reassess its HACCP plan for that product and take appropriate corrective actions.

      (iii) Failure by the establishment to act in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, or failure to meet the standard on the third consecutive series of FSIS-conducted tests for that product, constitutes failure to maintain sanitary conditions and failure to maintain an adequate HACCP plan, in accordance with part 417 of this chapter, for that product, and will cause FSIS to suspend inspection services. Such suspension will remain in effect until the establishment submits to the FSIS Administrator or his/her designee satisfactory written assurances detailing the action taken to correct the HACCP system and, as appropriate, other measures taken by the establishment to reduce the prevalence of pathogens.

      (a)  The establishment must comply with the facilities requirements in 9 CFR part 307. The establishment must provide a mirror at the carcass inspection station in accordance with 9 CFR 307.2(m)(6).

      (b)  The establishment must conduct carcass sorting activities and identify any condemnable conditions or defects before carcasses are presented to online inspectors. Establishment sorters must incise mandibular lymph nodes and palpate the viscera to detect the presence of animal diseases as part of their sorting activities. The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to ensure that market hog carcasses adulterated with septicemia, toxemia, pyemia, or cysticercosis are properly removed before the point of post-mortem inspection of carcasses. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite program. These procedures must cover the establishment sorting activities required under this section.

      (c)  The line speed limits in § 310.1 do not apply to the establishment, provided it is able to maintain effective process control and prevent contamination of carcasses and parts by enteric pathogens and visible fecal material, ingesta, and milk. Establishments operating under the NSIS must reduce their line speed as directed by the Inspector-in-Charge (IIC). The IIC is authorized to direct an establishment to operate at a reduced line speed when in their judgment a carcass-by-carcass inspection cannot be adequately performed within the time available due to the manner in which the carcasses are presented to the online inspector, the health conditions of a particular herd, or factors that may indicate a loss of process control.

      (d)  (1) The establishment must maintain records to document that the products resulting from its slaughter operation meet the definition of Ready-to-cook pork product in § 301.2. These records are subject to review and evaluation by FSIS personnel.

      (2) The establishment must maintain records to document the number of carcasses disposed of per day by establishment sorters before FSIS post-mortem inspection and the reasons that the carcasses were disposed of. These records are subject to review and evaluation by FSIS personnel.

**Source:** Source: 35 FR 15569, Oct. 3, 1970, unless otherwise noted.

      § 311.1   Disposal of diseased or otherwise adulterated carcasses and parts; general.

#### § § 311.1

      (a) The carcasses or parts of carcasses of all animals slaughtered at an official establishment and found at the time of slaughter or at any subsequent inspection to be affected with any of the diseases or conditions named in this part shall be disposed of according to the section pertaining to the disease or condition:  That no product shall be passed for human food under any such section unless it is found to be otherwise not adulterated. Products passed for cooking or refrigeration under this part must be so handled at the official establishment where they are initially prepared unless they are moved to another official establishment for such handling or in the case of products passed for refrigeration are moved for such refrigeration to a freezing facility approved by the Administrator in specific cases:  That when so moved the products are shipped in containers sealed in accordance with § 318.10(c) of this subchapter or in a sealed means of conveyance as provided in § 325.7 of this subchapter. Owning to the fact that it is impracticable to formulate rules covering every case and to designate at just what stage a disease process or a condition results in adulteration of a product, the decision as to the disposal of all carcasses, organs, or other parts not specifically covered in this part shall be left to the veterinary medical officer. The veterinary medical officer shall exercise his judgment regarding the disposition of all carcasses or parts of carcasses under this part in a manner which will insure that only wholesome, unadulterated product is passed for human food.

      (b) In cases of doubt as to a condition, a disease, or the cause of a condition, or to confirm a diagnosis, representative specimens of the affected tissues, properly prepared and packaged, shall be sent for examination to one of the laboratories of the Biological Control Section of the Program.

      § 311.2   Tuberculosis.

#### § § 311.2

      The following principles shall apply to the disposition of carcasses of livestock based on the difference in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in swine, cattle, sheep, goats, and equines.

      (a)  The entire carcass of swine, cattle, sheep, goats, and equines shall be condemned if any of the following conditions occur:

      (1) When the lesions of tuberculosis are generalized (tuberculosis is considered to be generalized when the lesions are distributed in a manner made possible only by entry of the bacilli into the systemic circulation);

      (2) When on ante mortem inspection the animal is observed to have a fever found to be associated with an active tuberculosis lesion on post mortem inspection;

      (3) When there is an associated cachexia;

      (4) When a tuberculosis lesion is found in any muscle or intermuscular tissue, or bone, or joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract) or in any lymph node as a result of draining a muscle, bone, joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract);

      (5) When the lesions are extensive in tissues of either the thoracic or the abdominal cavity;

      (6) When the lesions are multiple, acute, and actively progressive; or

      (7) When the character or extent of the lesions otherwise is not indicative of a localized condition.

      (b)  An organ or other part of a swine, cattle, sheep, goat, or equine carcass affected by localized tuberculosis shall be condemned when it contains lesions of tuberculosis or when the corresponding lymph node contains lesions of tuberculosis.

      (c)  Carcasses of cattle may be passed without restriction for human food only when the carcass of an animal not identified as a reactor to a tuberculin test administered by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State, or accredited veterinarian   is found free of tuberculosis lesions during postmortem inspection.

      (d)  (1) When a cattle carcass reveals a tuberculosis lesion or lesions not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.

      (2) When the carcass of a cattle identified as a reactor to a tuberculin test administered by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State or accredited veterinarian is found free of lesions of tuberculosis, the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter.

      (e)  Swine carcasses found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection may be passed for human food without restriction. When tuberculosis lesions in any swine carcass are localized and confined to one primary seat of infection, such as the cervical lymph nodes, the mesenteric lymph nodes, or the mediastinal lymph nodes, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for human food without restriction after the affected organ or other part is condemned.

      (f)  When the carcass of any swine reveals lesions more severe or more numerous than those described in paragraph (e) of this section, but not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portions of such carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.

      (g)  Carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines may be passed without restriction for human food only if found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection.

      (h)  If a carcass of any sheep, goat, or equine reveals a tuberculosis lesion or lesions that are not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.

#### § § 311.3

      (a) The carcasses of all hogs affected with hog cholera shall be condemned.

      (b) Inconclusive but suspicious symptoms of hog cholera observed during the ante-mortem inspection of a U.S. suspect shall be duly considered in connection with post-mortem findings and when the carcass of such a suspect shows lesions in the kidneys and the lymph nodes which resemble lesions of hog cholera, they shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned.

      (c) When lesions resembling those of hog cholera occur in kidneys and lymph nodes of carcasses of hogs which appeared normal on ante-mortem inspection, further inspection of such carcasses shall be made for corroborative lesions. If on such further inspection, characteristic lesions of hog cholera are found in some organ or tissue in addition to those in the kidneys or in the lymph nodes or in both, then all lesions shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned. Immediate notification shall be given by the inspector to the official in the Veterinary Services unit of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who has responsibility for control of swine diseases in the State where the swine are located.

      (1) The affection has involved the osseous structures of the head with extensive infection, suppuration, and necrosis;

      (2) There is metastasis from the eye, or the orbital region, to any lymph node including the parotid lymph node, internal organs, muscles, skeleton, or other structures, regardless of the extent of the primary tumor; or

      (3) The affection, regardless of extent, is associated with cachexia or evidence of absorption or secondary changes.

      (b) Carcasses of animals affected with epithelioma of the eye, or the orbital region, to a lesser extent than as described in paragraph (a) of this section may be passed for human food after removal and condemnation of the head, including the tongue, provided the carcass is otherwise normal.

      § 311.13   Pigmentary conditions; melanosis, xanthosis, ochronosis, etc.

#### § § 311.13

      (a) Except as provided in § 311.19, carcasses of livestock showing generalized pigmentary deposits shall be condemned.

      (b) The affected parts of carcasses showing localized pigmentary deposits of such character as to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated shall be removed and condemned.

      § 311.14   Abrasions, bruises, abscesses, pus, etc.

#### § § 311.14

      All slight, well-limited abrasions on the tongue and inner surface of the lips and mouth, when without lymph node involvement, shall be carefully excised, leaving only sound, normal tissue, which may be passed for human food. Any organ or other part of a carcass which is badly bruised or which is affected by an abscess, or a suppurating sore shall be condemned; and when the lesions are of such character or extent as to affect the whole carcass, the whole carcass shall be condemned. Portions of carcasses which are contaminated by pus or other diseased material shall be condemned.

      § 311.15   Brucellosis.

#### § § 311.15

      Carcasses affected with localized lesions of brucellosis may be passed for human food after the affected parts are removed and condemned.

      § 311.16   Carcasses so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.

#### § § 311.16

      (a) All carcasses of animals so infected that consumption of the products thereof may give rise to food poisoning shall be condemned. This includes all carcasses showing signs of:

      (1) Acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, or meninges.

      (2) Septicemia or pyemia, whether puerperal, traumatic, or without any evident cause.

      (3) Gangrenous or severe hemorrhagic enteritis or gastritis.

      (4) Acute diffuse metritis or mammitis.

Carcasses or parts of carcasses contaminated by contact with such diseased carcasses shall be condemned unless all contaminated tissues are removed within 2 hours.

      § 311.17   Necrobacillosis, pyemia, and septicemia.

#### § § 311.17

      From the standpoint of meat inspection, necrobacillosis may be regarded as a local infection at the beginning, and carcasses in which the lesions are localized may be passed for human food if in a good state of nutrition, after those portions affected with necrotic lesions are removed and condemned. However, when emaciation, cloudy swelling of the parenchymatous tissue of organs or enlargement of the lymph nodes is associated with the infection, it is evident that the disease has progressed beyond the condition of localization to a state of toxemia, and the entire carcass shall therefore be condemned as both unwholesome and noxious. Pyemia or septicemia may intervene as a complication of the local necrosis, and when present the carcass shall be condemned in accordance with § 311.16.

      § 311.18   Caseous lymphadenitis.

#### § § 311.18

      (a) A thin carcass showing well-marked lesions in the viscera and the skeletal lymph nodes, or a thin carcass showing extensive lesions in any part shall be condemned.

      (b) A thin carcass showing well-marked lesions in the viscera with only slight lesions elsewhere or showing well-marked lesions in the skeletal lymph nodes with only slight lesions elsewhere may be passed for cooking.

      (c) A thin carcass showing only slight lesions in the skeletal lymph nodes and in the viscera may be passed for human food without restriction.

      (d) A well-nourished carcass showing well-marked lesions in the viscera and with only slight lesions elsewhere or showing well-marked lesions confined to the skeletal lymph nodes with only slight lesions elsewhere may be passed for human food without restriction.

      (e) A well-nourished carcass showing well-marked lesions in the viscera and the skeletal lymph nodes may be passed for cooking; but where the lesions in a well-nourished carcass are both numerous and extensive, it shall be condemned.

      (f) All affected organs and nodes of carcasses passed for human food without restriction or passed for cooking shall be removed and condemned.

      (g) As used in this section, the term “thin” does not apply to a carcass which is anemic or emaciated; and the term “lesions” refers to lesions of caseous lymphadenitis.

      § 311.19   Icterus.

#### § § 311.19

      Carcasses showing any degree of icterus shall be condemned. Yellow fat conditions caused by nutritional factors or characteristic of certain breeds of livestock and yellow fat sometimes seen in sheep shall not be confused with icterus. Such carcasses should be passed for human food, if otherwise normal.

      § 311.20   Sexual odor of swine.

#### § § 311.20

      (a) Carcasses of swine which give off a pronounced sexual odor shall be condemned.

      (b) The meat of swine carcasses which give off a sexual odor less than pronounced may be passed for use in comminuted cooked meat food product or for rendering. Otherwise it shall be condemned.

#### § § 311.23

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, carcasses of cattle affected with lesions of cysticercus bovis shall be disposed of as follows:

      (1) Carcasses of cattle displaying lesions of cysticercus bovis shall be condemned if the infestation is extensive or if the musculature is edematous or discolored. Carcasses shall be considered extensively infested if in addition to finding lesions in at least two of the usual inspection sites, namely the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, they are found in at least two of the sites exposed by (i) an incision made into each round exposing the musculature in cross section, and (ii) a transverse incision into each forelimb commencing 2 or 3 inches above the point of the olecranon and extending to the humerus.

      (2) Carcasses of cattle showing one or more tapeworm lesions of cysticercus bovis but not so extensive as indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as determined by a careful examination, including examination of, but not limited to, the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, may be passed for human food after removal and condemnation of the lesions with surrounding tissues:  That the carcasses, appropriately identified by retained tags, are held in cold storage under positive control of a USDA Food Inspector at a temperature not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 10 days, or in the case of boned meat derived from such carcasses, the meat, when in boxes, tierces, or other containers, appropriately identified by retained tags, is held under positive control of a Program Inspector at a temperature of not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 20 days. As an alternative to retention in cold storage as provided in this subparagraph, such carcasses and meat may be heated throughout to a temperature of at least 140 °F. under positive control of a Program Inspector.

      (b) Edible viscera and offal shall be disposed of in the same manner as the rest of the carcass from which they were derived unless any lesion of cysticercus bovis is found in these byproducts, in which case they shall be condemned.

      § 311.24   Hogs affected with tapeworm cysts.

#### § § 311.24

      Carcasses of hogs affected with tapeworm cysts (Cysticercus cellulosae) may be passed for cooking, unless the infestation is excessive, in which case the carcass shall be condemned.

      § 311.25   Parasites not transmissible to man; tapeworm cysts in sheep; hydatid cysts; flukes; gid bladder-worms.

#### § § 311.25

      (a) In the disposal of carcasses, edible organs, and other parts of carcasses showing evidence of infestation with parasites not transmissible to man, the following general rules shall govern except as otherwise provided in this section: If the lesions are localized in such manner and are of such character that the parasites and the lesions caused by them can be completely removed, the nonaffected portion of the carcass, organ, or other part of the carcass may be passed for human food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions. If an organ or other part of a carcass shows numerous lesions caused by parasites, or if the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the part in any way unfit for human food, the affected part shall be condemned. If parasites are found to be distributed in a carcass in such a manner or to be of such character that their removal and the removal of the lesions caused by them is impracticable, no part of the carcass shall be passed for human food. If the infestation is excessive, the carcass shall be condemned. If the infestation is moderate, the carcass may be passed for cooking, but in case such carcass is not cooked as required by part 315 of this subchapter, it shall be condemned.

      (b) In the case of sheep carcasses affected with tapeworm cysts (Cysticercus ovis, so-called sheep measles, not transmissible to man), such carcasses may be passed for human food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions:  That if, upon the final inspection of sheep carcasses retained on account of measles, the total number of cysts found embedded in muscular tissue, or in immediate relation with muscular tissue, excluding the heart, exceeds five, the entire carcass shall be condemned, or such carcass shall be heated throughout to a temperature of at least 140 °F. After removal and condemnation of all affected portions.

      (c) Carcasses found infested with gid bladder-worms (Coenurus cerebralis, Multiceps multiceps) may be passed for human food after condemnation of the affected organ (brain or spinal cord).

      (d) Organs or other parts of carcasses infested with hydatid cysts (echinococus) shall be condemned.

      (e) Livers infested with flukes or fringed tapeworms shall be condemned.

      § 311.26   Emaciation.

#### § § 311.26

      Carcasses of livestock too emaciated to produce wholesome meat, and carcasses which show a serous infiltration of muscle tissues, or a serous or mucoid degeneration of the fatty tissue, shall be condemned. A gelatinous change of the fat of the heart and kidneys of well-nourished carcasses and mere leanness shall not be classed as emaciation.

If all parts are not so kept for inspection, the carcass shall be condemned. If, on inspection of a carcass slaughtered in the absence of an inspector, any lesion or other evidence is found indicating that the animal was sick or diseased, or affected with any other condition requiring condemnation of the animal on ante-mortem inspection, or if there is lacking evidence of the condition which rendered emergency slaughter necessary, the carcass shall be condemned. The parts and carcasses of cattle slaughtered in the absence of an inspector shall not be used for human food.

      (a) Livers affected with carotenosis shall be condemned.

      (b) Cattle livers and calf livers showing the conditions sometimes designated as “telangiectatic,” “sawdust,” or “spotted” shall be disposed of as follows:

      (1) When any or all of the conditions are slight in the organ, the whole organ shall be passed for human food without restriction.

      (2) When any or all of the conditions are more severe than slight and involve less than one-half of the organ, while in the remainder of the organ the conditions are slight or nonexistent, the remainder shall be passed for human food without restriction and the other portion shall be condemned.

      (3) When any or all of the conditions are more severe than slight and involve one-half or more of the organ, the whole organ shall be condemned.

      (4) The divisions of an organ into two parts as contemplated in this paragraph for disposition, shall be accomplished by one cut through the organ. This, of course, does not prohibit incisions which are necessary for inspection.

      (c) “Telangiectatic,” “sawdust,” or “spotted” livers and parts of livers which are condemned for human food may be shipped from an official establishment for purposes other than human food in accordance with § 314.10 of this subchapter.

      § 311.32   Vesicular diseases.

#### § § 311.32

      (a) Any carcass affected with vesicular disease shall be condemned if the condition is acute and if the extent of the condition is such that it affects the entire carcass or there is evidence of absorption or secondary change.

      (b) If muscular lesions are found to be distributed in such a manner or to be of such character that removal is practical, the following rules shall govern the disposal of the carcasses, edible organs, and other parts of carcasses showing such muscular lesions. If the lesions are localized in such a manner and are of such a character that the affected tissues can be removed, the nonaffected parts of the carcass may be passed for human food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portion. If a part of the carcass shows numerous lesions, or if the character of the lesion is such that complete extirpation is difficult and uncertainly accomplished, or if the lesion renders the part in any way unfit for human food, the part shall be condemned.

      (c) If the lesions are slight or of such character as to be insignificant from a standpoint of wholesomeness, the carcass or parts may be passed for use in the manufacture of comminuted cooked product, after removal and condemnation of the visibly affected portions.

      § 313.1   Livestock pens, driveways and ramps.

#### § § 313.1

      (a) Livestock pens, driveways and ramps shall be maintained in good repair. They shall be free from sharp or protruding objects which may, in the opinion of the inspector, cause injury or pain to the animals. Loose boards, splintered or broken planking, and unnecessary openings where the head, feet, or legs of an animal may be injured shall be repaired.

      (b) Floors of livestock pens, ramps, and driveways shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide good footing for livestock. Slip resistant or waffled floor surfaces, cleated ramps and the use of sand, as appropriate, during winter months are examples of acceptable construction and maintenance.

      (c) U.S. Suspects (as defined in § 301.2(xxx)) and dying, diseased, and disabled livestock (as defined in § 301.2(y)) shall be provided with a covered pen sufficient, in the opinion of the inspector, to protect them from the adverse climatic conditions of the locale while awaiting disposition by the inspector.

      (d) Livestock pens and driveways shall be so arranged that sharp corners and direction reversal of driven animals are minimized.

      § 313.2   Handling of livestock.

#### § § 313.2

      (a) Driving of livestock from the unloading ramps to the holding pens and from the holding pens to the stunning area shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Livestock shall not be forced to move faster than a normal walking speed.

      (b) Electric prods, canvas slappers, or other implements employed to drive animals shall be used as little as possible in order to minimize excitement and injury. Any use of such implements which, in the opinion of the inspector, is excessive, is prohibited. Electrical prods attached to AC house current shall be reduced by a transformer to the lowest effective voltage not to exceed 50 volts AC.

      (c) Pipes, sharp or pointed objects, and other items which, in the opinion of the inspector, would cause injury or unnecessary pain to the animal shall not be used to drive livestock.

      (d) Disabled livestock and other animals unable to move.

      (1) Disabled animals and other animals unable to move shall be separated from normal ambulatory animals and placed in the covered pen provided for in § 313.1(c).

      (2) The dragging of disabled animals and other animals unable to move, while conscious, is prohibited. Stunned animals may, however, be dragged.

      (3) Disabled animals and other animals unable to move may be moved, while conscious, on equipment suitable for such purposes; e.g., stone boats.

      (e) Animals shall have access to water in all holding pens and, if held longer than 24 hours, access to feed. There shall be sufficient room in the holding pen for animals held overnight to lie down.

      (f) Stunning methods approved in § 313.30 shall be effectively applied to animals prior to their being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut.

      § 313.5   Chemical; carbon dioxide.

#### § § 313.5

      The slaughtering of sheep, calves and swine with the use of carbon dioxide gas and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.

      (a)  (1) The carbon dioxide gas shall be administered in a chamber in accordance with this section so as to produce surgical anesthesia in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animals shall be exposed to the carbon dioxide gas in a way that will accomplish the anesthesia quickly and calmly, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. In swine, carbon dioxide may be administered to induce death in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut.

      (2) The driving or conveying of the animals to the carbon dioxide chamber shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the anesthesia chamber is essential since the induction, or early phase, of anesthesia is less violent with docile animals. Among other things this requires that, in driving animals to the anesthesia chamber, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.

      (3) On emerging from the carbon dioxide tunnel, the animals shall be in a state of surgical anesthesia and shall remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking, and bleeding, except for swine in which death has been induced by the administration of carbon dioxide. Asphyxia or death from any cause shall not be produced in animals before bleeding, except for swine in which death has been induced by the administration of carbon dioxide.

      (b) —(1)  (i) The carbon dioxide gas shall be administered in a tunnel which is designed to permit the effective exposure of the animal. Two types of tunnels, based on the same principle, are in common use for carbon dioxide anesthesia. They are the “U” type tunnel and the “Straight Line” type tunnel, and are based on the principle that carbon dioxide gas has a higher specific gravity than air. The tunnels are open at both ends for entry and exit of animals and have a depressed central section. Anesthetizing, or, in the case of swine, death-inducing, carbon dioxide concentrations are maintained in the central sections of the tunnels. Effective anaesthetization is produced in these central sections. Animals are driven from holding pens through pathways constructed of large-diameter pipe or smooth metal and onto continuous conveyor devices that move the animals through the tunnels. The animals are either compartmentalized on the conveyors by mechanical impellers synchronized with the conveyor or they are otherwise prevented from crowding. While impellers are used to compartmentalize the animals, mechanically or manually operated gates are used to move the animals onto the conveyors. Surgically anaesthetized animals, or killed swine, are moved out of the tunnels by the same continuous conveyors that moved them into and through the carbon dioxide gas.

      (ii) Flow of animals into and through the carbon dioxide chamber is dependent on one operator. The operation or stoppage of the conveyor is entirely dependent upon this operator. It is necessary that he be skilled, attentive, and aware of his responsibility. Overdosages and death of animals can be brought about by carelessness of this individual.

      (2)  The ability of anesthetizing equipment to perform with maximum efficiency is dependent on its proper design and efficient mechanical operation. Pathways, compartments, gas chambers, and all other equipment used must be designed to accommodate properly the species of animals being anesthetized. They shall be free from pain-producing restraining devices. Injury of animals must be prevented by the elimination of sharp projections or exposed wheels or gears. There shall be no unnecessary holes, spaces or openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Impellers or other devices designed to mechanically move or drive animals or otherwise keep them in motion or compartmentalized shall be constructed of flexible or well padded rigid material. Power activated gates designed for constant flow of animals to anesthetizing equipment shall be so fabricated that they will not cause injury. All equipment involved in anesthetizing animals shall be maintained in good repair.

      (3)  Maintenance of a uniform carbon dioxide concentration and distribution in the anesthesia chamber is a vital aspect of producing surgical anesthesia. This may be assured by reasonably accurate instruments which sample and analyze carbon dioxide gas concentration within the chamber throughout anesthetizing operations. Gas concentration shall be maintained uniform so that the degree of anesthesia in exposed animals will be constant. Carbon dioxide gas supplied to anesthesia chambers may be from controlled reduction of solid carbon dioxide or from a controlled liquid source. In either case the carbon dioxide shall be supplied at a rate sufficient to anesthetize adequately and uniformly the number of animals passing through the chamber. Sampling of gas for analysis shall be made from a representative place or places within the chamber and on a continuing basis. Gas concentrations and exposure time shall be graphically recorded throughout each day's operation. Neither carbon dioxide nor atmospheric air used in the anesthesia chambers shall contain noxious or irritating gases. Each day before equipment is used for anesthetizing animals, proper care shall be taken to mix adequately the gas and air within the chamber. All gas producing and control equipment shall be maintained in good repair and all indicators, instruments, and measuring devices must be available for inspection by Program inspectors during anesthetizing operations and at other times. An exhaust system must be provided so that, in case of equipment failure, non-uniform carbon dioxide concentrations in the gas tunnel or contamination of the ambient air of the establishment will be prevented.

      § 313.15   Mechanical; captive bolt.

#### § § 313.15

      The slaughtering of sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses, mules, and other equines by using captive bolt stunners and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.

      (a)  (1) The captive bolt stunners shall be applied to the livestock in accordance with this section so as to produce immediate unconsciousness in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animals shall be stunned in such a manner that they will be rendered unconscious with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.

      (2) The driving of the animals to the stunning area shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the stunning areas is essential since accurate placement of stunning equipment is difficult on nervous or injured animals. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the stunning areas, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.

      (3) Immediately after the stunning blow is delivered the animals shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness and remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding.

      (b) —(1)  (i) Acceptable captive bolt stunning instruments may be either skull penetrating or nonpenetrating. The latter type is also described as a concussion or mushroom type stunner. Penetrating instruments on detonation deliver bolts of varying diameters and lengths through the skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by physical brain destruction and a combination of changes in intracranial pressure and acceleration concussion. Nonpenetrating or mushroom stunners on detonation deliver a bolt with a flattened circular head against the external surface of the animal's head over the brain. Diameter of the striking surface of the stunner may vary as conditions require. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a combination of acceleration concussion and changes in intracranial pressures. A combination instrument utilizing both penetrating and nonpenetrating principles is acceptable. Energizing of instruments may be accomplished by detonation of measured charges of gunpowder or accurately controlled compressed air. Captive bolts shall be of such size and design that, when properly positioned and activated, immediate unconsciousness is produced.

      (ii) To assure uniform unconsciousness with every blow, compressed air devices must be equipped to deliver the necessary constant air pressure and must have accurate, constantly operating air pressure gauges. Gauges must be easily read and conveniently located for use by the stunning operator and the inspector. For purposes of protecting employees, inspectors, and others, it is desirable that any stunning device be equipped with safety features to prevent injuries from accidental discharge. Stunning instruments must be maintained in good repair.

      (iii) The stunning area shall be so designed and constructed as to limit the free movements of animals sufficiently to allow the operator to locate the stunning blow with a high degree of accuracy. All chutes, alleys, gates and restraining mechanisms between and including holding pens and stunning areas shall be free from pain-producing features such as exposed bolt ends, loose boards, splintered or broken planking, and protruding sharp metal of any kind. There shall be no unnecessary holes or other openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Overhead drop gates shall be suitably covered on the bottom edge to prevent injury on contact with animals. Roughened or cleated cement shall be used as flooring in chutes leading to stunning areas to reduce falls of animals. Chutes, alleys, and stunning areas shall be so designed that they will comfortably accommodate the kinds of animals to be stunned.

      (iv) The stunning operation is an exacting procedure and requires a well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately place the stunning instrument to produce immediate unconsciousness. He must use the correct detonating charge with regard to kind, breed, size, age, and sex of the animal to produce the desired results.

      (2)  (i) Choice of instrument and force required to produce immediate unconsciousness varies, depending on kind, breed, size, age, and sex of the animal. Young swine, lambs, and calves usually require less stunning force than mature animals of the same kind. Bulls, rams, and boars usually require skull penetration to produce immediate unconsciousness. Charges suitable for smaller kinds of livestock such as swine or for young animals are not acceptably interchanged for use on larger kinds or older livestock, respectively.

      (ii) Captive bolt stunners that deliberately inject compressed air into the cranium at the end of the penetration cycle shall not be used to stun cattle.

      § 313.16   Mechanical; gunshot.

#### § § 313.16

      The slaughtering of cattle, calves, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines by shooting with firearms and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.

      (a)  (1) The firearms shall be employed in the delivery of a bullet or projectile into the animal in accordance with this section so as to produce immediate unconsciousness in the animal by a single shot before it is shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animal shall be shot in such a manner that they will be rendered unconscious with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.

      (2) The driving of the animals to the shooting areas shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the shooting area is essential since accurate placement of the bullet is difficult in case of nervous or injured animals. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the shooting areas, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.

      (3) Immediately after the firearm is discharged and the projectile is delivered, the animal shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness and remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding.

      (b) —(1)  (i) On discharge, acceptable firearms dispatch free projectiles or bullets of varying sizes and diameters through the skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a combination of physical brain destruction and changes in intracranial pressure. Caliber of firearms shall be such that when properly aimed and discharged, the projectile produces immediate unconsciousness.

      (ii) To assure uniform unconsciousness of the animal with every discharge where small-bore firearms are employed, it is necessary to use one of the following type projectiles: Hollow pointed bullets; frangible iron plastic composition bullets; or powdered iron missiles. When powdered iron missiles are used, the firearms shall be in close proximity with the skull of the animal when fired. Firearms must be maintained in good repair. For purposes of protecting employees, inspectors and others, it is desirable that all firearms be equipped with safety devices to prevent injuries from accidental discharge. Aiming and discharging of firearms should be directed away from operating areas.

      (iii) The provisions contained in § 313.15(b)(1)(iii) with respect to the stunning area also apply to the shooting area.

      (iv) The shooting operation is an exacting procedure and requires a well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately direct the projectile to produce immediate unconsciousness. He must use the correct caliber firearm, powder charge and type of ammunition to produce the desired results.

      (2)  Choice of firearms and ammunition with respect to caliber and choice of powder charge required to produce immediate unconsciousness of the animal may vary depending on age and sex of the animal. In the case of bulls, rams, and boars, small bore firearms may be used provided they are able to produce immediate unconsciousness of the animals. Small bore firearms are usually effective for stunning other cattle, sheep, swine, and goats, and calves, horses, and mules.

      § 313.30   Electrical; stunning or slaughtering with electric current.

#### § § 313.30

      The slaughtering of swine, sheep, calves, cattle, and goats with the use of electric current and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.

      (a)  (1) The electric current shall be administered so as to produce, at a minimum, surgical anesthesia, i.e., a state where the animal feels no painful sensation. The animals shall be either stunned or killed before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. They shall be exposed to the electric current in a way that will accomplish the desired result quickly and effectively, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.

      (2) The driving or conveying of the animals to the place of application of electric current shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the place of application is essential to ensure rapid and effective insensibility. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the place of application, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.

      (3) The quality and location of the electrical shock shall be such as to produce immediate insensibility to pain in the exposed animal.

      (4) The stunned animal shall remain in a state of surgical anesthesia through shackling, sticking, and bleeding.

      (b) —(1)  It is necessary that the operator of electric current application equipment be skilled, attentive, and aware of his or her responsibility.

      (2)  The ability of electric current equipment to perform with maximum efficiency is dependent on its proper design and efficient mechanical operation. Pathways, compartments, current applicators, and all other equipment used must be designed to properly accommodate the species of animals being anesthetized. Animals shall be free from pain-producing restraining devices. Injury of animals must be prevented by the elimination of sharp projections or exposed wheels or gears. There shall be no unnecessary holes, spaces or openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Impellers or other devices designed to mechanically move or drive animals or otherwise keep them in motion or compartmentalized shall be constructed of flexible or padded material. Power activated gates designed for constant flow of animals shall be so fabricated that they will not cause injury. All equipment used to apply and control the electrical current shall be maintained in good repair, and all indicators, instruments, and measuring devices shall be available for inspection by Program inspectors during the operation and at other times.

      (3)  Each animal shall be given a sufficient application of electric current to ensure surgical anesthesia throughout the bleeding operation. Suitable timing, voltage and current control devices shall be used to ensure that each animal receives the necessary electrical charge to produce immediate unconsciousness. The current shall be applied so as to avoid the production of hemorrhages or other tissue changes which could interfere with inspection procedures.

      § 313.50   Tagging of equipment, alleyways, pens, or compartments to prevent inhumane slaughter or handling in connection with slaughter.

#### § § 313.50

      When an inspector observes an incident of inhumane slaughter or handling in connection with slaughter, he/she shall inform the establishment operator of the incident and request that the operator take the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence. If the establishment operator fails to take such action or fails to promptly provide the inspector with satisfactory assurances that such action will be taken, the inspector shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, as appropriate.

      (a) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of facility deficiencies, disrepair, or equipment breakdown, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag thereto. No equipment, alleyway, pen or compartment so tagged shall be used until made acceptable to the inspector. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to such tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.

      (b) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of establishment employee actions in the handling or moving of livestock, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag to the alleyways leading to the stunning area. After the tagging of the alleyway, no more livestock shall be moved to the stunning area until the inspector receives satisfactory assurances from the establishment operator that there will not be a recurrence. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to the tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.

      (c) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of improper stunning, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag to the stunning area. Stunning procedures shall not be resumed until the inspector receives satisfactory assurances from the establishment operator that there will not be a recurrence. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to such tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.

      § 314.1   Disposition of condemned products at official establishments having tanking facilities; sealing of tanks.

#### § § 314.1

      (a) Carcasses, parts of carcasses, and other products condemned at official establishments having facilities for tanking shall, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or elsewhere in this part, be disposed of by tanking as follows:

      (1) The lower opening of the tank shall first be sealed securely by a Program employee, except when permanently connected with a blow line; then the condemned products shall be placed in the tank in his presence, after which the upper opening shall also be sealed securely by such employee, who shall then see that the contents of the tank are subjected to sufficient heating for sufficient time to effectively destroy the contents for human food purposes.

      (2) The use of equipment such as crushers or hashers for pretanking preparation of condemned products in the inedible products department has been found to give inedible character and appearance to the material. Accordingly, if condemned products are so crushed or hashed, conveying systems, rendering tanks, and other equipment used in the further handling of crushed or hashed material need not be locked or sealed during the tanking operations. If the rendering tanks or other equipment contain condemned material not so crushed or hashed, the equipment shall be sealed as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the crushed or hashed material is not rendered in the establishment where produced, it shall be denatured as provided for in § 314.3 before leaving such establishment.

      (b) The seals of tanks shall be broken only by a Program employee and only after the contents of the tanks have been treated as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The rendered fat derived from condemned material shall be held until a Program employee shall have had an opportunity to determine whether it conforms with the requirements of this section. Samples shall be taken by Program employees as often as is necessary to determine whether the rendered fat is effectually denatured.

      (c) Carcasses of animals condemned under § 309.3 of this subchapter may be disposed of as provided in § 314.3, in lieu of tanking, with the approval of the inspector.

#### § § 314.11

      Condemned carcasses of animals affected with one or more of the following conditions may be shipped from an official establishment only for purposes other than human food and only if permission therefor is obtained from the circuit supervisor: Anasarca, Ocular Squamous Cell Carcinoma (after removal of neoplastic tissue), emaciation, eosinophilic myositis, immaturity, nonseptic bruises and injuries, and sarcosporidiosis. This provision also applies to unborn calves and to products such as paunches and udders when they have not been handled as required under this subchapter for products for human food purposes; provided, such articles have not been condemned for other pathological reasons. Such permission will be granted only if all parts to be so used will be promptly handled, freely slashed and adequately identified as required by § 325.13(a)(2) of this subchapter. The slashing, identification and packing of the product shall be accomplished in an inedible product area under the supervision of an inspector. Facilities must be adequate so that the carcasses or parts saved under these provisions are not contaminated with pus, manure, septic, or toxic materials, or similar substances. The operation must not result in unsanitary conditions within the establishment.

        (5) An official inspection legend and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the number of the official establishment, in the form required by part 312 of this subchapter;

        (6) Any other information required by the regulations in this part or part 319 of this subchapter.

        (d) The principal display panel shall be the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for sale. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part and part 319 of this subchapter with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring of such information by designs or vignettes or crowding. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. The principal display panel shall be:

        (1) In the case of a rectangular package, one entire side, the area of which is at least the product of the height times the width of that side.

        (2) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container:

        (i) An area that is 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference of the container, or

        (ii) A panel, the width of which is one-third of the circumference and the height of which is as high as the container:  That if there is immediately to the right or left of such principal display panel, a panel which has a width not greater than 20 percent of the circumference and a height as high as the container, and which is reserved for information prescribed in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (5), such panel shall be known as the “20 percent panel” and such information may be shown on that panel in lieu of showing it on the principal display panel.

        (3) In the case of a container of any other shape, 40 percent of the total surface of the container.

        (e)(1) Any descriptive designation used as a product name for a product which has no common or usual name shall clearly and completely identify the product. Product which has been prepared by salting, smoking, drying, cooking, chopping, or otherwise shall be so described on the label unless the name of the product implies, or the manner of packaging shows that the product was subjected to such preparation. The unqualified terms “meat,” “meat byproduct,” “meat food product,” and terms common to the meat industry but not common to consumers such as “picnic,” “butt,” “cala,” “square,” “loaf,” “spread,” “delight,” “roll,” “plate,” “luncheon,” and “daisy” shall not be used as names of a product unless accompanied with terms descriptive of the product or with a list of ingredients, as deemed necessary in any specific case by the Administrator in order to assure that the label will not be false or misleading.

        (2) The product name for a raw meat product that contains added solution and does not meet a standard of identity in 9 CFR part 319 must contain a descriptive designation that includes:

        (i) The percentage of added solution (total weight of the solution ingredients divided by the weight of the raw meat without solution or any other added ingredients multiplied by 100). The percentage of added solution must appear as a number (such as, 15, 20, 30) and the percent symbol (%). The percentage of added solution may be declared by the words “containing” or “contains” (such as, “contains 15% added solution of water and salt,” or “containing 15% added solution of water and teriyaki sauce”).

        (ii) The common or usual name of all individual ingredients or multi-ingredient components in the solution listed in descending order of predominance by weight.

        (iii) When the descriptive designation includes all ingredients in the solution, a separate ingredients statement is not required on the label. When the descriptive designation includes multi-ingredient components and the ingredients of the component are not declared in the descriptive designation, all ingredients in the product must be declared in a separate ingredients statement on the label as required in § 317.2(c)(2) and (f).

        (iv) The product name and the descriptive designation must be printed in a single easy-to-read type style and color and must appear on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than one-third ( ) the size of the largest letter.

        (v) The word “enhanced” cannot be used in the product name.

        (3)

        (i) Unless the product is destined to be fully cooked or to receive another full lethality treatment at an official establishment, the product name for a raw or partially cooked beef product that has been mechanically tenderized, whether by needle or by blade, must contain the term “mechanically tenderized,” “needle tenderized,” or “blade tenderized,” as a descriptive designation and an accurate description of the beef component.

        (ii) The product name must appear in a single easy-to-read type style and color and on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than   the size of the largest letter.

        (iii) The labels on raw or partially cooked needle- or blade-tenderized beef products destined for household consumers, hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions must contain validated cooking instructions, including the cooking method, that inform consumers that these products need to be cooked to a specified minimum internal temperature, whether the product needs to be held for a specified time at that temperature or higher before consumption to ensure that potential pathogens are destroyed throughout the product, and a statement that the internal temperature should be measured by a thermometer. These validated cooking instructions may appear anywhere on the label.

        (f)(1) The list of ingredients shall show the common or usual names of the ingredients arranged in the descending order of predominance, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph.

        (i) The terms spice, natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor and flavoring may be used in the following manner:

        (A) The term “spice” means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, with the exceptions of onions, garlic and celery, whose primary function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in 21 CFR 182.10, and 184.

        (B) The term “natural flavor,” “natural flavoring,” “flavor” or “flavoring” means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product or roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portion of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.

        (ii) The term “corn syrup” may be used to designate either corn syrup or corn syrup solids.

        (iii) The term “animal and vegetable fats” or “vegetable and animal fats” may be used to designate the ingredients of mixtures of such edible fats in product designated “compound” or “shortening.” “Animal fats” as used herein means fat derived from inspected and passed cattle, sheep, swine, or goats.

        (iv) When a product is coated with pork fat, gelatin, or other approved substance and a specific declaration of such coating appears contiguous to the name of the product, the ingredient statement need not make reference to the ingredients of such coating.

        (v) When two meat ingredients comprise at least 70 percent of the meat and meat byproduct ingredients of a formula and when neither of the two meat ingredients is less than 30 percent by weight of the total meat and meat byproducts used, such meat ingredients may be interchanged in the formula without a change being made in the ingredients statement on labeling materials:  That the word “and” in lieu of a comma shall be shown between the declaration of such meat ingredients in the statement of ingredients.

        (vi)(A) Product ingredients which are present in individual amounts of 2 percent or less by weight may be listed in the ingredients statement in other than descending order of predominance:  That such ingredients are listed by their common or usual names at the end of the ingredients statement and preceded by a quantifying statement, such as “Contains __________ percent of __________ ,” “Less than __________percent of __________ .” The percentage of the ingredient(s) shall be filled in with a threshold level of 2 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.0 percent, or 0.5 percent, as appropriate. No ingredient to which the quantifying statement applies may be present in an amount greater than the stated threshold. Such a quantifying statement may also be utilized when an ingredients statement contains a listing of ingredients by individual components. Each component listing may utilize the required quantifying statement at the end of each component ingredients listing.

        (B) Such ingredients may be adjusted in the product formulation without a change being made in the ingredients statement on the labeling, provided that the adjusted amount complies with part 319 of this subchapter and with § 424.21 of subchapter E, and does not exceed the amount shown in the quantifying statement. Any such adjustments to the formulation shall be provided to the inspector-in-charge.

        (2) On containers of frozen dinners, entrees, pizzas, and similar consumer packaged products in cartons the ingredient statement may be placed on the front riser panel:  That the words “see ingredients” followed immediately by an arrow is placed on the principal display panel immediately above the location of such statement without intervening print or designs.

        (3) The ingredient statement may be placed on the 20 percent panel adjacent to the principal display panel and reserved for required information, in the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container.

        (4) The ingredients statement may be placed on the information panel, except as otherwise permitted in this subchapter.

        (g)(1) The name or trade name of the person that prepared the product may appear as the name of the manufacturer or packer without qualification on the label. Otherwise the name of the distributor of the product shall be shown with a phrase such as “Prepared for * * *”. The place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall be shown on the label by city, State, and postal ZIP code when such business is listed in a telephone or city directory, and if not listed in such directory, then the place of business shall be shown by street address, city, State, and postal ZIP code.

        (2) The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor may be shown:

        (i) On the principal display panel, or

        (ii) On the 20 percent panel adjacent to the principal display panel and reserved for required information, in the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, or

        (iii) On the front riser panel of frozen food cartons, or

        (iv) On the information panel.

        (h)(1) The statement of net quantity of contents shall appear on the principal display panel of all containers to be sold at retail intact, in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other matter on the container, and shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

        (2) The statement as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practices will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall be as provided in § 317.19. The statement shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count such as “jumbo quart,” “full gallon,” “giant quart,” “when packed,” “minimum,” or words of similar importance.

        (3) The statement shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the panel in lines generally parallel to the base:  That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the statement meets the other requirements of this paragraph (h). In any case, the statement may appear in more than one line. The terms “net weight” or “net wt.” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight, and the term “net contents” or “content” when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of fluid measure.

        (4) Except as provided in § 317.7, the statement shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois weight or liquid measure. Where no general consumer usage to the contrary exists, the statement shall be in terms of liquid measure, if the product is liquid, or in terms of weight if the product is solid, semisolid viscous or a mixture of solid and liquid. For example, a declaration of  -pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz.” except as provided for in paragraph (h)(5) of this section for random weight packages; a declaration of 1   pounds avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1 lb. 8 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1  lb.,” or “Net Wt. 1.5 lbs.”.

        (5) On packages containing 1 pound or 1 pint and less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or in pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart, except that on random weight packages the statement shall be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound, for packages over 1 pound, and for packages which do not exceed 1 pound the statement may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces. Paragraph (h)(9) of this section permits certain exceptions from the provisions of this paragraph for margarine packages, random weight consumer size packages, and packages of less than   ounce net weight. Pargraph (h)(12) of this section permits certain exceptions from the provision of this paragraph for multi-unit packages.

        (6) The statement shall be in letters and numerals in type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform of all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:

        (i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages, the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less;

        (ii) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches;

        (iii) Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches;

        (iv) Not less than one-quarter inch in height on packages, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 but not more than 400 square inches.

        (v) Not less than one-half inch in height on packages, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 400 square inches.

        (7) The ratio of height to width of letters and numerals shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). Heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the height standards.

        (8) The statement shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel and shall be separated by a space at least equal to the height of the lettering used in the statement from other printed label information appearing above or below the statement and by a space at least equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the statement. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count such as, “jumbo quart,” “full gallon,” “giant quart,” “when packed,” “Minimum” or words of similar import.

        (9) The following exemptions from the requirements contained in this paragraph (h) are hereby established:

        (i) Individually wrapped, random weight consumer size packages shipped in bulk containers (as specified in paragraph (h)(11) of this section) and meat products that are subject to shrinkage through moisture loss during good distribution practices and are designated as gray area type of products as defined under § 317.19 need not bear a net weight statement when shipped from an official establishment, provided that a net weight shipping statement which meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section is applied to their shipping container prior to shipping it from the official establishment. Net weight statements so applied to the shipping container are exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph, if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the shipping container. The net weight also shall be applied directly to random weight consumer size packages prior to retail display and sale. The net weight statement on random weight consumer size packages for retail sale shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph, if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.

        (ii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than   ounce net weight and random weight consumer size packages shall be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they are in a shipping container and the statement of net quantity of contents on the shipping container meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section;

        (iii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than   ounce net weight bearing labels declaring net weight, price per pound, and total price, shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph, if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.

        (iv) Margarine in 1 pound rectangular packages (except packages containing whipped or soft margarine or packages that contain more than four sticks) is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (h)(3) of this section regarding the placement of the statement of the net quantity of contents within the bottom 30 percent of the principal display panel and that the statement be expressed both in ounces and in pounds, if the statement appears as “1 pound” or “one pound” in a conspicuous manner on the principal display panel.

        (v) Sliced shingle packed bacon in rectangular packages is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (h)(3) of this section regarding the placement of the statement of the net quantity of contents within the bottom 30 percent of the principal display panel if the statement appears in a conspicuous manner on the principal display panel.

        (10) Labels for containers which bear any representation as to the number of servings contained therein shall bear, contiguous to such representation, and in the same size type as is used for such representation, a statement of the net quantity of each such serving.

        (11) As used in this section, a “random weight consumer size package” is one which is one of a lot, shipment or delivery of packages of the same product with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern.

        (12) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the net quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and in parentheses, the total net quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces. For the purposes of this section, “multiunit retail package” means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, with the individual packages intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units and the labeling thereon are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (h) (2), (3), (6), and (8) of this section.

        (i) The official establishment number of the official establishment in which the product was processed under inspection shall be placed as follows:

        (1) Within the official inspection legend in the form required by part 312 of this subchapter; or

        (2) Outside the official inspection legend elsewhere on the exterior of the container or its labeling, e.g., the lid of a can, if shown in a prominent and legible manner in a size sufficient to insure easy visibility and recognition and accompanied by the prefix “EST”; or

        (3) Off the exterior of the container, e.g., on a metal clip used to close casings or bags, or on the back of a paper label of a canned product, or on other packaging or labeling material in the container, e.g., on aluminum pans and trays placed within containers, when a statement of its location is printed contiguous to the official inspection legend, such as “EST. No. on Metal Clip” or “Est. No. on Pan”, if shown in a prominent and legible manner in a size sufficient to insure easy visibility and recognition; or

        (4) On an insert label placed under a transparent covering if clearly visible and legible and accompanied by the prefix “EST”.

        (4) When any other artificial flavoring is permitted under part 318 of this subchapter to be added to a product, the ingredient statement shall identify it as “Artificial Flavoring.”

        (5) When artificial coloring is added to edible fats as permitted under part 318 of this subchapter such substance shall be declared on the label in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of the product by the words “Artificially colored” or “Artificial coloring added” or “With added artificial coloring.” When natural coloring such as annatto is added to edible fats as permitted under part 318 of this subchapter, such substance shall be declared on the label in the same manner by a phrase such as “Colored with annatto.”

        (6) When product is placed in a casing to which artificial coloring is applied as permitted under part 318 of this subchapter, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of the product, the words, “Artificially colored.”

        (7) If a casing is removed from product at an official establishment and there is evidence of artificial coloring on the surface of the product, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of product, the words “Artificially colored.”

        (8) When a casing is colored prior to its use as a covering for product and the color is not transferred to the product enclosed in the casing, no reference to color need appear on the label but no such casing may be used if it is misleading or deceptive with respect to color, quality, or kind of product, or otherwise.

        (9) Product which bears or contains any other artificial coloring, as permitted under part 318 of this subchapter, shall bear a label stating that fact on the immediate container or if there is none, on the product.

        (11) Containers of meat packed in borax or other preservative for export to a foreign country which permits the use of such preservative shall, at the time of packing, be marked “for export,” followed on the next line by the words “packed in preservative,” or such equivalent statement as may be approved for this purpose by the Administrator and directly beneath this there shall appear the word “establishment” or abbreviation thereof, followed by the number of the establishment at which the product is packed. The complete statement shall be applied in a conspicuous location and in letters not less than 1 inch in height.

        (12) Containers of other product packed in, bearing, or containing any chemical preservative shall bear a label stating that fact.

        (13)(i) On the label of any “Mechanically Separated (Species)” described in § 319.5(a) of this subchapter, the name of such product shall be followed immediately by the phrase “for processing” unless such product has a protein content of not less than 14 percent and a fat content of not more than 30 percent.

        (ii) When _a_ny “Mechanically Separated (Species)” descri_b_ed in § 319.5 of this subchapter is used as an ingredient in the preparation of a meat food product and such “Mechanically Separated (Species)” contributes 20 mg or more of calcium to a serving of such meat food product, the label of such meat food product shall state the calcium content of such meat food product, determined and expressed as the percentage of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (U.S. RDA) in a serving in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(b)(1), (c)(7) (i) and (iv), and (e), as part of any nutrition information included on such label, or if such meat food product does not bear nutrition labeling information, as part of a prominent statement in immediate conjunction with the list of ingredients, as follows: “A ______ serving contains ____% of the U.S. RDA of calcium”, with the blanks to be filled in, respectively, with the quantity of such product that constitutes a serving and the amount of calcium provided by such serving:  That, calcium content need not be stated where () the percent of the U.S. RDA of calcium to be declared would not differ from the percent of the U.S. RDA that would be declared if the meat food product contained only hand deboned ingredients or () the calcium content of a serving of the meat food product would be 20 percent of the U.S. RDA or more if the meat food product contained only hand deboned ingredients.

        (k) Packaged products which require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition shall have prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label the statement: “Keep Refrigerated,” “Keep Frozen,” “Perishable Keep Under Refrigeration,” or such similar statement as the Administrator may approve in specific cases.

        § 317.3   Approval of abbreviations of marks of inspection; preparation of marking devices bearing inspection legend without advance approval prohibited; exception.

#### § § 317.3

        (a) The Administrator may approve and authorize the use of abbreviations of marks of inspection under the regulations in this subchapter. Such abbreviations shall have the same force and effect as the respective marks for which they are authorized abbreviations.

        (b) Except for the purposes of preparing and submitting a sample or samples of the same to the Administrator for approval, no brand manufacturer, printer, or other person shall cast, print, lithograph, or otherwise make any marking device containing any official mark or simulation thereof, or any label bearing any such mark or simulation, without the written authority therefor of the Administrator. However, when any such sample label, or other marking device, is approved by the Administrator, additional supplies of the approved label, or marking device, may be made for use in accordance with the regulations in this subchapter, without further approval by the Administrator. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to labels, or other marking devices, bearing or containing an official inspection legend shown in § 312.2(b), § 312.3(a) (only the legend appropriate for horse meat food products) or § 312.3(b) (only the legend appropriate for other (nonhorse) equine meat food products), or any abbreviations, copy or representation thereof.

        (c) No brand manufacturer or other person shall cast or otherwise make, without an official certificate issued in quadruplicate by a Program employee, a brand or other marking device containing an official inspection legend, or simulation thereof, shown in § 312.2(a), § 312.3(a) (only the legend appropriate for horse carcasses and parts of horse carcasses), § 312.3(b) (only the legend appropriate for other equine (nonhorse) carcasses and parts of other (nonhorse) equine carcasses) or § 312.7(a).

        (1) The certificate is a Food Safety and Inspection Service form for signature by a Program employee and the official establishment ordering the brand or other marking device, bearing a certificate serial number and a letterhead and the seal of the United States Department of Agriculture. The certificate authorizes the making of only the brands or other marking devices of the type and quantity listed on the certificate.

        (2) After signing the certificate, the Program employee and the establishment shall each keep a copy, and the remaining two copies shall be given to the brand or other marking device manufacturer.

        (3) The manufacturer of the brands or other marking devices shall engrave or otherwise mark each brand or other marking device with a permanent identifying serial number unique to it. The manufacturer shall list on each of the two copies of the certificate given to the manufacturer the number of each brand or other marking device authorized by the certificate. The manufacturer shall retain one copy of the certificate for the manufacturer's records and return the remaining copy with the brands or other marking devices to the Program employee whose name and address are given on the certificate as the recipient.

        (4) In order that all such brands or other marking devices bear identifying numbers, within one year after June 24, 1985, an establishment shall either replace each such brand or other marking device which does not bear an identifying number, or, under the direction of the inspector-in-charge, mark such brand or other marking device with a permanent identifying number.

#### § §§ 317.4-317.5

        § 317.6   Approved labels to be used only on products to which they are applicable.

#### § § 317.6

        Labels shall be used only on products for which they are approved, and only if they have been approved for such products in accordance with § 317.3:  That existing stocks of labels approved prior to the effective date of this section and the quantity of which has been identified to the circuit supervisor as being in storage on said date at the official establishment or other identified warehouse for the account of the operator of the official establishment may be used until such stocks are exhausted, but not later than 1 year after the effective date of this section unless such labels conform to all the requirements of this part and part 319 of this subchapter. The Administrator may upon the show of good cause grant individual extension of time as he deems necessary.

        § 317.7   Products for foreign commerce; printing labels in foreign language permissible; other deviations.

#### § § 317.7

        Labels to be affixed to packages of products for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language and may show the statement of the quantity of contents in accordance with the usage of the country to which exported and other deviations from the form of labeling required under this part may be approved for such product by the Administrator in specific cases:

        (a) That the proposed labeling accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser,

        (b) That it is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which the product is intended for export, and

        (c) That the outside container is labeled to show that it is intended for export; but if such product is sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce, all the requirements of this subchapter apply. The inspection legend and the establishment number shall in all cases appear in English but in addition, may appear literally translated in a foreign language.

        § 317.8   False or misleading labeling or practices generally; specific prohibitions and requirements for labels and containers.

#### § § 317.8

        (a) No product or any of its wrappers, packaging, or other containers shall bear any false or misleading marking, label, or other labeling and no statement, word, picture, design, or device which conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin or quality or is otherwise false or misleading shall appear in any marking or other labeling. No product shall be wholly or partly enclosed in any wrapper, packaging, or other container that is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading.

        (b) The labels and containers of product shall comply with the following provisions, as applicable:

        (1) Establishments may only use statements, words, pictures, designs, or devices on the label having geographical significance with reference to a locality other than where the animal from which the product was derived was born, raised, slaughtered, and processed if the statements, words, pictures, designs, or devices are qualified by the word “style,” “type,” or “brand,” as the case may be, in the same size and style of lettering as in the geographical statement, word, picture, design, or device, and accompanied with a prominent qualifying statement identifying the country, State, Territory, or locality, using terms appropriate to effect the qualification. When the word “style” or “type” is used, there must be a recognized style or type of product identified with and peculiar to the area represented by the geographical statement, word, picture, design, or device and the product must possess the characteristics of such style or type, and the word “brand” shall not be used in such a way as to be false or misleading: Provided, That a geographical statement, word, picture, design, or device which has come into general usage as a trade name and which has been approved by the Administrator as being a generic statement, word, picture, design, or device may be used without the qualifications provided for in this paragraph. The terms “frankfurter,” “vienna,” “bologna,” “lebanon bologna,” “braunschweiger,” “thuringer,” “genoa,” “leona,” “berliner,” “holstein,” “goteborg,” “milan,” “polish,” “italian,” and their modifications, as applied to sausages, the terms “brunswick” and “irish” as applied to stews and the term “boston” as applied to pork shoulder butts need not be accompanied with the word “style,” “type,” or “brand,” or a statement identifying the locality in which the product is prepared.

        (2) Such terms as “farm” or “country” shall not be used on labels in connection with products unless such products are actually prepared on the farm or in the country:  That if the product is prepared in the same way as on the farm or in the country these terms, if qualified by the word “style” in the same size and style of lettering, may be used:  That the term “farm” may be used as part of a brand designation when qualified by the word “brand” in the same size and style of lettering, and followed with a statement identifying the locality in which the product is prepared:  That the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to products prepared in accordance with § 319.106 of this subchapter. Sausage containing cereal shall not be labeled “farm style” or “country style,” and lard not rendered in an open kettle shall not be designated as “farm style” or “country style.”

        (3) The requirement that the label shall contain the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall not relieve any establishment from the requirement that its label shall not be misleading in any particular.

        (4) The term “spring lamb” or “genuine spring lamb” is applicable only to carcasses of new-crop lambs slaughtered during the period beginning in March and terminating not beyond the close of the week containing the first Monday in October.

        (5)(i) Coverings shall not be of such color, design, or kind as to be misleading with respect to color, quality, or kind of product to which they are applied. For example, transparent or semitransparent coverings for such articles as sliced bacon or fresh (uncooked) meat and meat food products shall not bear lines or other designs of red or other color which give a false impression of leanness of the product. Transparent or semitransparent wrappers, casings, or coverings for use in packaging cured, cured and smoked, or cured and cooked sausage products, and sliced ready-to-eat meat food products may be color tinted or bear red designs on 50 percent of such wrapper or covering:  That the transparent or semitransparent portion of the principal display panel is free of color tinting and red designs:  That the principal display panel provides at least 20 percent unobstructed clear space, consolidated in one area so that the true nature and color of the product is visible to the consumer.

        (ii) Packages for sliced bacon that have a transparent opening shall be designed to expose, for viewing, the cut surface of a representative slice. Packages for sliced bacon which meet the following specifications will be accepted as meeting the requirements of this subparagraph provided the enclosed bacon is positioned so that the cut surface of the representative slice can be visually examined:

        () For shingle-p_a_cked sliced bacon, the transparent window shall be designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension) of the representative slice, and this window shall be at least 1  inches wide. The transparent window shall be located not more than five-eighths inch from the top or bottom edge of a 1-pound or smaller package and not more than three-fourths inch from either the top or bottom edge of a package larger than 1 pound.

        () For stack-packed sliced _b_acon, the transparent window shall be designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension) of the representative slice and be at least 1  inches wide.

        (6) The word “fresh” shall not be used on labels to designate product which contains any sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, or potassium nitrite, or which has been salted for preservation.

        (7)(i) No ingredient shall be designated on the label as a spice, flavoring, or coloring unless it is a spice, flavoring, or coloring, as the case may be. An ingredient that is both a spice and a coloring, or both a flavoring and a coloring, shall be designated as “spice and coloring”, or “flavoring and coloring”, as the case may be, unless such ingredient is designated by its common or usual name.

        (ii) Any ingredient not designated in § 317.2(f)(1)(i) of this part whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock and poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.

        (8) As used on labels of product, the term “gelatin” shall mean (i) the jelly prepared in official establishments by cooking pork skins, tendons, or connective tissue from inspected and passed product, and (ii) dry commercial gelatin or the jelly resulting from its use.

        (9) Product (other than canned product) labeled with the term “loaf” as part of its name:

        (i) If distributed from the official establishment in consumer size containers may be in any shape;

        (ii) If distributed in a container of a size larger than that sold intact at retail the product shall be prepared in rectangular form, or as in paragraph (b)(9)(iii) of this section;

        (iii) If labeled as an “Old Fashioned Loaf” shall be prepared in a traditional form, such as rectangular with rounded top or circular with flat bottom and rounded top.

        (10) The term “baked” shall apply only to product which has been cooked by the direct action of dry heat and for a sufficient time to permit the product to assume the characteristics of a baked article, such as the formation of a brown crust on the surface, rendering out of surface fat, and the caramelization of the sugar if applied. Baked loaves shall be heated to a temperature of at least 160 °F. and baked pork cuts shall be heated to an internal temperature of at least 170 °F.

        (11) When products such as loaves are browned by dipping in hot edible oil or by a flame, the label shall state such fact, e.g., by the words “Browned in Hot Cottonseed Oil” or “Browned by a Flame,” as the case may be, appearing as part of the product name.

        (12) The term “meat” and the names of particular kinds of meat, such as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork, shall not be used in such manner as to be false or misleading.

        (13) The word “ham,” without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine. Ham shanks as such or ham shank meat as such or the trimmings accruing in the trimming and shaping of hams shall not be labeled “ham” or “ham meat” without qualification. When used in connection with a chopped product the term “ham” or “ham meat” shall not include the skin.

        (14) The terms “shankless” and “hockless” shall apply only to hams and pork shoulders from which the shank or hock has been completely removed, thus eliminating the entire tibia and fibula, or radius and ulna, respectively, together with the overlying muscle, skin, and other tissue.

        (15) Such terms as “meat extract” or “extract of beef” without qualification shall not be used on labels in connection with products prepared from organs or other parts of the carcass, other than fresh meat. Extracts prepared from any parts of the carcass other than fresh meat may be properly labeled as extracts with the true name of the parts from which prepared. In the case of extract in fluid form, the word “fluid” shall also appear on the label, as, for example, “fluid extract of beef.”

        (16) [Reserved]

        (17) When any product is enclosed in a container along with a packing substance such as brine, vinegar, or agar jelly, a declaration of the packing substance shall be printed prominently on the label as part of the name of the product, as for example, “frankfurts packed in brine,” “lamb tongue packed in vinegar,” or “beef tongue packed in agar jelly,” as the case may be. The packing substance shall not be used in such a manner as will result in the container being so filled as to be misleading.

        (18) “Leaf lard” is lard prepared from fresh leaf fat.

        (19) When lard or hardened lard is mixed with rendered pork fat or hardened rendered pork fat, the mixture shall be designated as “rendered pork fat” or “hardened rendered pork fat,” as the case may be.

        (20) Oil, stearin, or stock obtained from beef or mutton fats rendered at a temperature above 170 °F. shall not be designated as “oleo oil,” “oleo stearin,” or “oleo stock,” respectively.

        (21) When not more than 20 percent of beef fat, mutton fat, oleo stearin, vegetable stearin, or hardened vegetable fat is mixed with lard or with rendered pork fat, there shall appear on the label, contiguous to and in the same size and style of lettering as the name of the product, the words “beef fat added,” “mutton fat added,” “oleo stearin added,” “vegetable stearin added,” or “hardened vegetable fat added,” as the case may be. If more than 20 percent is added, the product name shall refer to the particular animal fat or fats used, such as, “Lard and Beef Fat.” The designation “vegetable fat” is applicable to vegetable oil, vegetable stearin, or a combination of such oil and stearin, whereas the designations “vegetable oil” and “vegetable stearin” shall be applicable only to the oil and the stearin respectively, when used in meat food products.

        (22) Cooked, cured, or pickled pigs feet, pigs knuckles, and similar products, shall be labeled to show that the bones remain in the product, if such is the case. The designation “semi-boneless” shall not be used if less than 50 percent of the total weight of bones has been removed.

        (23) When monoglycerides, diglycerides, and/or polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are added to rendered animal fat or a combination of such fat and vegetable fat, there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of the product a statement such as “With Monoglycerides and Diglycerides Added,” or “With Diglycerides and Monoglycerides,” or “With Polyglycerol Esters of Fatty Acids” as the case may be.

        (24) Section 407 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains provisions with respect to colored margarine or colored oleomargarine (21 U.S.C. 347) which are set forth herein as footnote.

        (25) When approved proteolytic enzymes as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter are used on steaks or other raw meat cuts, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement, “Tenderized with [approved enzyme],” to indicate the use of such enzymes. Any other approved substance which may be used in the solution shall also be included in the statement.

        When approved inorganic chlorides as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter are used on steaks or other raw meat cuts there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement, “Tenderized with (names of approved inorganic chloride(s))” to indicate the use of such inorganic chlorides. Any other approved substance which may be in the solution shall also be included in the statement.

        (26) When dimethylpolysiloxan is added as an antifoaming agent to rendered fats, its presence shall be declared on the label contiguous to the name of the product. Such declaration shall read “Dimethylpolysiloxan Added.”

        (27) When pizzas are formulated with crust containing calcium propionate or sodium propionate, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the name of the product the statement “________ added to retard spoilage of crust” preceded by the name of the preservative.

        (28) Sausage of the dry varieties treated with potassium sorbate or propylparaben (propyl p-hydroxybenzoate) as permitted by part 318 of this subchapter, shall be marked or labeled with a statement disclosing such treatment and the purpose thereof, such as “dipped in a potassium sorbate solution to retard mold growth.”

        (29) Meat of goats shall be identified as goat meat or chevon.

        (30) The term “Chitterlings” shall apply to the large intestines of swine, or young bovine animals when preceded with the word “Calf” or “Veal.” Meat food products that contain chitterlings or calf or veal chitterlings, in accordance with § 318.6(b)(8) of this subchapter shall be identified with product names that refer to such ingredients, as for instance, “Chitterling Loaf,” “Chitterling Pie,” or “Calf Chitterlings and Gravy,” and shall be packed in containers having a capacity of 3 pounds or less and of a kind usually sold at retail intact and bearing such other information as is required by this part.

        (31) Products that contain blood from livestock as permitted by part 318 of this subchapter shall be labeled with a name that includes the term “blood,” and the specific kind of blood shall be declared in the ingredient statement, e.g., “Swine blood,” in the manner required by this part.

        (32) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph:

        (i) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.

        (ii) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date there must be a phrase explaining the meaning of the date, in terms of “packing” date, “sell by” date, or “use before” date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., “For Maximum Freshness” or “For Best Quality.”

        (33) [Reserved]

        (34) The terms “All,” “Pure,” “100%,” and terms of similar connotation shall not be used on labels for products to identify ingredient content, unless the product is prepared solely from a single ingredient.

        (35) When agar-agar is used in canned jellied meat food products, as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter, there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, a statement to indicate the use of agar-agar.

        (36) When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, and lactic acid and calcium carbonate (or glucono delta-lactone) are used together in a dry binding matrix in restructured, formed meat food products, as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name, a statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate and lactic acid and calcium carbonate (or glucono delta-lactone).

        (37) The labels of sausages encased in natural casings made from meat or poultry viscera shall identify the type of meat or poultry from which the casings were derived, if the casings are from a different type of meat or poultry than the encased meat or poultry. The identity of the casing, if required, may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement. Establishments producing, manufacturing, or using natural sausage casings are to maintain records documenting the meat or poultry source in accordance with part 320 of this chapter.

        (38) The labels of sausages encased in regenerated collagen casings shall disclose this fact on the product label. The fact that the sausage is encased in collagen may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement.

        (39) When transglutaminase enzyme is used to bind pieces of meat to form a cut of meat, or to reform a piece of meat from a multiple cuts, there shall appear on the label, as part of the product name, a statement that indicates that the product has been “formed” or “reformed,” in addition to other preparation steps, e.g., “Formed Beef Tenderloin” or “Reformed and Shaped Beef Tenderloin.”

        (40) A country of origin statement on the label of any meat “covered commodity” as defined in 7 CFR Part 65, Subpart A, that is to be sold by a “retailer,” as defined in 7 CFR 65.240, must comply with the requirements in 7 CFR 65.300 and 65.400.

All packaging materials must be safe for their intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FFDCA).

        (b) Packaging materials entering the official establishment must be accompanied or covered by a guaranty, or statement of assurance, from the packaging supplier under whose brand name and firm name the material is marketed to the official establishment. The guaranty shall state that the material's intended use complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations. The guaranty must identify the material, e.g., by the distinguishing brand name or code designation appearing on the packaging material shipping container; must specify the applicable conditions of use, including temperature limits and any other pertinent limits specified under the FFDCA and food additive regulations; and must be signed by an authorized official of the supplying firm. The guaranty may be limited to a specific shipment of an article, in which case it may be part of or attached to the invoice covering such shipment, or it may be general and continuing, in which case, in its application to any article or other shipment of an article, it shall be considered to have been given at the date such article was shipped by the person who gives the guaranty. Guaranties consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations regarding such guaranties (21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13) will be acceptable. The management of the establishment must maintain a file containing guaranties for all food contact packaging materials in the establishment. The file shall be made available to Program inspectors or other Department officials upon request. While in the official establishment, the identity of all packaging materials must be traceable to the applicable guaranty.

        (c) The guaranty by the packaging supplier will be accepted by Program inspectors to establish that the use of material complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations.

        (d) The Department will monitor the use of packaging material in official establishments to assure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and may question the basis for any guaranty described under paragraph (b) of this section. Official establishments and packaging suppliers providing written guaranties to those official establishments will be permitted an opportunity to provide information tm designated Department officials as needed to verify the basis for any such guaranty. The required information will include, but is not limited to, manufacturing firm's name, trade name or code designation for the material, complete chemical composition, and use. Selection of a material for review does not in itself affect a material's acceptability. Materials may continue to be used during the review period. However, if information requested from the supplier is not provided within the time indicated in the request—a minimum of 30 days—any applicable guaranty shall cease to be effective, and approval to continue using the specified packaging material in official establishments may be denied. The Administrator may extend this time where reasonable grounds for extension are shown, as, for example, where data must be obtained from suppliers.

        (e) The Administrator may disapprove for use in official establishments packaging materials whose use cannot be confirmed as complying with FFDCA and applicable food additive regulations. Before approval to use a packaging material is finally denied by the Administrator, the affected official establishment and the supplier of the material shall be given notice and the opportunity to present their views to the Administrator. If the official establishment and the supplier do not accept the Administrator's determination, a hearing in accordance with applicable rules of practice will be held to resolve such dispute. Approval to use the materials pending the outcome of the presentation of views or hearing shall be denied if the Administrator determines that such use may present an imminent hazard to public health.

        (f) Periodically, the Administrator will issue to inspectors a listing, by distinguishing brand name or code designation, of packaging materials that have been reviewed and that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Listed materials will not be permitted for use in official establishments. If a subsequent review of any material indicates that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a), the material will be deleted from the listing.

        (g) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of Program inspectors to refuse a specific material if he/she determines the material may render products adulterated or injurious to health.

        § 317.309   Nutrition label content.

#### § § 317.309

        (a) All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.

        (b)(1) The term “serving” or “serving size” means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion—General Food Supply” (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in § 317.312(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ______ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the Reference Amounts in § 317.312(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition claims.

        (3) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of the product “as packaged” for all products, except that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 may be declared on the basis of the product “as consumed”. For single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, if data are based on the product ‘as consumed,’ the data must be presented in accordance with § 317.345(d). In addition to the required declaration on the basis of “as packaged” for products other than single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, the declaration may also be made on the basis of “as consumed,” provided that preparation and cooking instructions are clearly stated.

        (4) For products in discrete units (e.g., hot dogs, and individually packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and barbecue sauce), the serving size shall be declared as follows:

        (i) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.

        (ii) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size.

        (iii) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.

        (iv) If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.

        (v) For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or milliliter) or larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.

        (vi) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined in § 317.312(c).

        (vii) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.

        (5) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g. pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g.,   quiche,   pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product determined in § 317.312(d) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product determined in § 317.312(c). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use  ,  ,  ,  ,  , or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.

        (6) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole roast beef, marinated beef tenderloin, large can of chili), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., roast beef and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in § 317.312(c).

        (7) For labeling purposes, the term “common household measure” or “common household unit” means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g.,   pizza), ounce (oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar or tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, the following rules shall be used:

        (i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in  - or  -cup increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities less than   cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp), 1, 1 , 1 , or 1   tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 teaspoon (tsp), and in  -tsp increments for quantities less than 1 tsp.

        (ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.

        (iii) If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used. Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).

        (iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., chop, slice, link, or patty).

        (v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.

        (vi) For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., ham with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.

        (vii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 grams (g).

        (viii) When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp), manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.

        (8) A product that is packaged and sold individually and that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating occasion.

        (9) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.

        (i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single-servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.

        (ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.

        (iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced bologna. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz increments.

        (iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.

        (10) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.

        (i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).

        (ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size (e.g., pickled pigs feet), the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).

        (iii) For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parenthesis following the “varied” statement (e.g., varied (approximately 8 servings per pound)).

        (iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.

        (v) For packages containing several individually packaged multi-serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multi-serving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, including those that have been previously frozen.

        (11) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 and products that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.

        (12) The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(l) and § 317.313(m) in single-serving containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 317.312(b) if the product is listed in § 317.312(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers that are not listed in § 317.312(b) will be based on the reference amount according to § 317.312(c), (d), and (e).

        (13) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information in the same format as required by § 317.309(e),

        (i) Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as packaged or purchased.

        (ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.

        (14) If a product consists of assortments of meat or meat food products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual product.

        (15) If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)):  That the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.

        (c) The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in labeling of a meat or meat food product shall contain information about the level of the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph. No nutrients or food components other than those listed in this paragraph as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the nutrition label. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, nutrient information shall be presented using the nutrient names specified and in the following order in the formats specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.

        (1) “Calories, total,” “Total calories,” or “Calories”: A statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero. Energy content per serving may also be expressed in kilojoule units, added in parenthesis immediately following the statement of the caloric content.

        (i) Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods. Where either specific or general food factors are used, the factors shall be applied to the actual amount (i.e., before rounding) of food components (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, protein, or ingredients with specific food factors) present per serving.

        (A) Using specific Atwater factors (i.e., the Atwater method) given in Table 13, page 25, “Energy Value of Foods—Basis and Derivation,” by A. L. Merrill and B. K.

        (iii) “Monounsaturated fat” or “Monounsaturated” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of monounsaturated fat per serving defined as -monounsaturated fatty acids may be declared voluntarily, except that when polyunsaturated fat is declared, or when a claim about fatty acids or cholesterol is made on the label or in labeling of a product other than one that meets the criteria in § 317.362(b)(1) for a claim for “fat free,” label declaration of monounsaturated fat is required. Monounsaturated fat content shall be indented and expressed as grams per serving to the nearest 0.5 ( )-gram increment below 5 grams and to the nearest gram increment above 5 grams. If the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content shall be expressed as zero.

        (3) “Cholesterol”: A statement of the cholesterol content per serving expressed in milligrams to the nearest 5-milligram increment, except that label declaration of cholesterol information is not required for products that contain less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving and make no claim about fat, fatty acids, or cholesterol content, or such products may state the cholesterol content as zero. If the product contains 2 to 5 milligrams of cholesterol per serving, the content may be stated as “less than 5 milligrams.”

        (4) “Sodium”: A statement of the number of milligrams of sodium per serving expressed as zero when the serving contains less than 5 milligrams of sodium, to the nearest 5-milligram increment when the serving contains 5 to 140 milligrams of sodium, and to the nearest 10-milligram increment when the serving contains greater than 140 milligrams.

        (5) “Potassium” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of milligrams of potassium per serving may be declared voluntarily, except that when a claim is made about potassium content, label declaration shall be required. Potassium content shall be expressed as zero when the serving contains less than 5 milligrams of potassium, to the nearest 5-milligram increment when the serving contains 5 to 140 milligrams of potassium, and to the nearest 10-milligram increment when the serving contains greater than 140 milligrams.

        (6) “Carbohydrate, total” or “Total carbohydrate”: A statement of the number of grams of total carbohydrate per serving expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, or, if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero. Total carbohydrate content shall be calculated by subtraction of the sum of the crude protein, total fat, moisture, and ash from the total weight of the product. This calculation method is described in USDA's Agriculture Handbook No. 74 (Slightly revised February 1973), pages 2 and 3, which is incorporated by reference. Pages 2 and 3, Agriculture Handbook No. 74 is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. (The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section.)

        (i) “Dietary fiber”: A statement of the number of grams of total dietary fiber per serving, indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, declaration of dietary fiber is not required, or, alternatively, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (A) “Soluble fiber” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of soluble dietary fiber per serving may be declared voluntarily except when a claim is made on the label or in labeling about soluble fiber, label declaration shall be required. Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (B) “Insoluble fiber” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of insoluble dietary fiber per serving may be declared voluntarily except when a claim is made on the label or in labeling about insoluble fiber, label declaration shall be required. Insoluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (ii) “Sugars”: A statement of the number of grams of sugars per serving, except that label declaration of sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of sugars per serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, or sugar alcohol content. Sugars shall be defined as the sum of all free mono- and disaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose). Sugars content shall be indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (iii) “Sugar alcohol” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of sugar alcohols per serving may be declared voluntarily on the label, except that when a claim is made on the label or in labeling about sugar alcohol or sugars when sugar alcohols are present in the product, sugar alcohol content shall be declared. For nutrition labeling purposes, sugar alcohols are defined as the sum of saccharide derivatives in which a hydroxyl group replaces a ketone or aldehyde group and whose use in the food is listed by FDA (e.g., mannitol or xylitol) or is generally recognized as safe (e.g., sorbitol). In lieu of the term “sugar alcohol,” the name of the specific sugar alcohol (e.g., “xylitol”) present in the product may be used in the nutrition label, provided that only one sugar alcohol is present in the product. Sugar alcohol content shall be indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less then 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (iv) “Other carbohydrate” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of other carbohydrate per serving may be declared voluntarily. Other carbohydrate shall be defined as the difference between total carbohydrate and the sum of dietary fiber, sugars, and sugar alcohol, except that if sugar alcohol is not declared (even if present), it shall be defined as the difference between total carbohydrate and the sum of dietary fiber and sugars. Other carbohydrate content shall be indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.

        (7) “Protein”: A statement of the number of grams of protein per serving expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero. When the protein in products represented or purported to be for adults and children 4 or more years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 20 expressed as a percent, or when the protein in a product represented or purported to be for children greater than 1 but less than 4 years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 40 expressed as a percent, either of the following shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content by weight: The statement “not a significant source of protein,” or a listing aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value” of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or Reference Daily Intake (RDI), as appropriate, for protein and expressed as percent of Daily Value. When the protein quality in a product as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a product represented or purported to be for infants, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor of 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by appropriate methods of analysis in accordance with § 317.309(h), except when the procedure for a specific food requires another factor.

        (i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be for infants or children under 4 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it shall be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the product is represented or purported to be for infants and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.

        (ii) The corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving for products represented or purported to be for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 in “Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” Rome, 1990, which is incorporated by reference. Sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 of the “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” as published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization, is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. It is available for inspection at the office of the FSIS Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  Copies of the incorporation by reference are available from the Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 329, West End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700. For products represented or purported to be for infants, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject product's protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.

        (iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and the RDI for protein for children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women shall be 16 grams, 14 grams, 60 grams, and 65 grams, respectively.

        (8) Vitamins and minerals: A statement of the amount per serving of the vitamins and minerals as described in this paragraph, calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as percent of Daily Value.

        (i) For purposes of declaration of percent of Daily Value as provided for in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, products represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women shall use the RDI's that are specified for the intended group. For products represented or purported to be for use by both infants and children under 4 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants from birth to 12 months of age and for children under 4 years of age. Similarly, the percent of Daily Value based on both the RDI values for pregnant women and for lactating women shall be declared separately on products represented or purported to be for use by both pregnant and lactating women. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. All other products shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.

        (ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a percent of the RDI shall include vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, in that order, and shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added, or when a claim is made about them. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or in labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:

        (A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another product; or

        (B) Included in a product solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredients statement. The declaration may also include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are naturally occurring in the food. The additional vitamins and minerals shall be listed in the order established in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section.

        (iii) The percentages for vitamins and minerals shall be expressed to the nearest 2-percent increment up to and including the 10-percent level, the nearest 5-percent increment above 10 percent and up to and including the 50-percent level, and the nearest 10-percent increment above the 50-percent level. Amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared in nutrition labeling but may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).” Alternatively, if vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, or iron is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement “Not a significant source of ______ (listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)” is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values.

        (iv) The following RDI's and nomenclature are established for the following vitamins and minerals which are essential in human nutrition:

        (v) The following synonyms may be added in parenthesis immediately following the name of the nutrient or dietary component:

        (vi) A statement of the percent of vitamin A that is present as -carotene may be declared voluntarily. When the vitamins and minerals are listed in a single column, the statement shall be indented under the information on vitamin A. When vitamins and minerals are arrayed horizontally, the statement of percent shall be presented in parenthesis following the declaration of vitamin A and the percent of Daily Value of vitamin A in the product (e.g., “Percent Daily Value: Vitamin A 50 (90 percent as -carotene)”). When declared, the percentages shall be expressed in the same increments as are provided for vitamins and minerals in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section.

        (9) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV, the following DRV's are established for the following food components based on the reference caloric intake of 2,000 calories:

        (d)(1) Nutrient information specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be presented on products in the following format, except on products on which dual columns of nutrition information are declared as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, on those products on which the simplified format is permitted to be used as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, on products for infants and children less than 4 years of age as provided for in § 317.400(c), and on products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (i) The nutrition information shall be set off in a box by use of hairlines and shall be all black or one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical.

        (ii) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize:

        (A) A single easy-to-read type style,

        (B) Upper and lower case letters,

        (C) At least one point leading (i.e., space between two lines of text) except that at least four points leading shall be utilized for the information required by paragraphs (d)(7) and (d)(8) of this section, and

        (D) Letters should never touch.

        (iii) Information required in paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(5), (d)(7), and (d)(8) of this section shall be in type size no smaller than 8 point. Except for the heading “Nutrition Facts,” the information required in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(6), and (d)(9) of this section and all other information contained within the nutrition label shall be in type size no smaller than 6 point. When provided, the information described in paragraph (d)(10) of this section shall also be in type no smaller than 6 point.

        (iv) The headings required by paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(4), and (d)(6) of this section (i.e., “Nutrition Facts,” “Amount per Serving,” and “% Daily Value*”), the names of all nutrients that are not indented according to requirements of paragraph (c) of this section (i.e., Calories, Total fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Potassium, Total carbohydrate, and Protein), and the percentage amounts required by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section shall be highlighted by bold or extra bold type or other highlighting (reverse printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) that prominently distinguishes it from other information. No other information shall be highlighted.

        (v) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate “Amount Per Serving” from the calorie statements required in paragraph (d)(5) of this section and shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent of Daily Value required in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) and (d)(7)(ii) of this section from the nutrient and percent of Daily Value above and below it.

        (2) The information shall be presented under the identifying heading of “Nutrition Facts” which shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, except for labels presented according to the format provided for in paragraph (d)(11) of this section, unless impractical, shall be set the full width of the information provided under paragraph (d)(7) of this section.

        (3) Information on serving size shall immediately follow the heading. Such information shall include:

        (i) “Serving Size”: A statement of the serving size as specified in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.

        (ii) “Servings Per Container”: The number of servings per container, except that this statement is not required on single-serving containers as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section or on single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301.

        (4) A subheading “Amount Per Serving” shall be separated from serving size information by a bar.

        (5) Information on calories shall immediately follow the heading “Amount Per Serving” and shall be declared in one line, leaving sufficient space between the declaration of “Calories” and “Calories from fat” to allow clear differentiation, or, if “Calories from saturated fat” is declared, in a column with total “Calories” at the top, followed by “Calories from fat” (indented), and “Calories from saturated fat” (indented).

        (6) The column heading “% Daily Value,” followed by an asterisk (e.g., “% Daily Value*”), shall be separated from information on calories by a bar. The position of this column heading shall allow for a list of nutrient names and amounts as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section to be to the left of, and below, this column heading. The column headings “Percent Daily Value,” “Percent DV,” or “% DV” may be substituted for “% Daily Value.”

        (7) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, and except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2), nutrient information for both mandatory and any voluntary nutrients listed in paragraph (c) of this section that are to be declared in the nutrition label, except vitamins and minerals, shall be declared as follows:

        (i) The name of each nutrient, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be given in a column and followed immediately by the quantitative amount by weight for that nutrient appended with a “g” for grams or “mg” for milligrams.

        (ii) A listing of the percent of the DRV as established in paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (c)(9) of this section shall be given in a column aligned under the heading “% Daily Value” established in paragraph (d)(6) of this section with the percent expressed to the nearest whole percent for each nutrient declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section for which a DRV has been established, except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The percent shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the DRV for the nutrient, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).

        (8) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and shall be arrayed horizontally (e.g., Vitamin A 4%, Vitamin C 2%, Calcium 15%, Iron 4%) or may be listed in two columns, except that when more than four vitamins and minerals are declared, they may be declared vertically with percentages listed under the column headed “% Daily Value.”

        (9) A footnote, preceded by an asterisk, shall be placed beneath the list of vitamins and minerals and shall be separated from that list by a hairline.

        (i) The footnote shall state: Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.

        (ii) If the percent of Daily Value is given for protein in the Percent of Daily Value column as provided in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, protein shall be listed under dietary fiber, and a value of 50 g shall be inserted on the same line in the column headed “2,000” and value of 65 g in the column headed “2,500.”

        (iii) If potassium is declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, potassium shall be listed under sodium and the DRV established in paragraph (c)(9) of this section shall be inserted on the same line in the numeric columns.

        (iv) The abbreviations established in paragraph (g)(2) of this section may be used within the footnote.

        (10) Caloric conversion information on a per-gram basis for fat, carbohydrate, and protein may be presented beneath the information required in paragraph (d)(9), separated from that information by a hairline. This information may be presented horizontally (i.e., “Calories per gram: Fat 9, Carbohydrate 4, Protein 4”) or vertically in columns.

        (11)(i) If the space beneath the information on vitamins and minerals is not adequate to accommodate the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the information required in paragraph (d)(9) may be moved to the right of the column required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.

        (ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of iron is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.

        (iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (i.e., approximately 3 inches) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of iron, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display in which the footnote required by paragraph (d)(9) of the section is given to the far right of the label, and additional vitamins and minerals beyond the four that are required (i.e., vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) are arrayed horizontally following declarations of the required vitamins and minerals.

        (12) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:

        (13)(i) Nutrition labeling on the outer label of packages of meat or meat food products that contain two or more products in the same packages (e.g., variety packs) or of packages that are used interchangeably for the same type of food (e.g., meat salad containers) may use an aggregate display.

        (ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with format requirements of paragraph (d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” title, and both the quantitative amount by weight (i.e., g/mg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food.

        (14) When nutrition labeling appears in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.

        (e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same product (e.g., both “raw” and “cooked”) or for common combinations of foods as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for different units (e.g., per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDI's are established (e.g., both infants and children less than 4 years of age) as provided for in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:

        (1) Following the subheading of “Amount Per Serving,” there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the forms of the same product (e.g., “raw” and “roasted”), the combinations of foods, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared. The column representing the product as packaged and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) shall be to the left of the numeric columns.

        (2) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same product, for combinations of foods, or for different units, total calories and calories from fat (and calories from saturated fat, when declared) shall be listed in a column and indented as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section with quantitative amounts declared in columns aligned under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (3) Quantitative information by weight required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall be specified for the form of the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b).

        (i) Quantitative information by weight may be included for other forms of the product represented by the additional column(s) either immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information by weight for the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) or as a footnote.

        (A) If such additional quantitative information is given immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information, it shall be declared for all nutrients listed and placed immediately following and differentiated from the required quantitative information (e.g., separated by a comma). Such information shall not be put in a separate column.

        (B) If such additional quantitative information is given in a footnote, it shall be declared in the same order as the nutrients are listed in the nutrition label. The additional quantitative information may state the total nutrient content of the product identified in the second column or the nutrient amounts added to the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, for only those nutrients that are present in different amounts than the amounts declared in the required quantitative information. The footnote shall clearly identify which amounts are declared. Any subcomponents declared shall be listed parenthetically after principal components (e.g.,   cup skim milk contributes an additional 40 calories, 65 mg sodium, 6 g total carbohydrate (6 g sugars), and 4 g protein).

        (ii) Total fat and its quantitative amount by weight shall be followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) (e.g., “Total fat (2 g)*”) referring to another asterisk (or symbol) at the bottom of the nutrition label identifying the form(s) of the product for which quantitative information is presented.

        (4) Information required in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(8) of this section shall be presented under the subheading “% DAILY VALUE” and in columns directly under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:

        (f)(1) Nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as set forth herein when any required nutrients, other than the core nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein), are present in insignificant amounts. An insignificant amount shall be defined as that amount that may be rounded to zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars and protein, it shall be an amount less than 1 gram.

        (2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:

        (i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, sodium, and protein;

        (ii) Any of the following that are present in more than insignificant amounts: Calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron; and

        (iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added in fortified or fabricated foods.

        (3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the product in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.

        (4) Any required nutrient, other than a core nutrient, that is present in an insignificant amount may be omitted from the tabular listing, provided that the following statement is included at the bottom of the nutrition label, “Not a significant source of ________.” The blank shall be filled in with the appropriate nutrient or food component. Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).”

        (5) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in § 317.400(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”

        (g) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and § 317.302(a) by one or more of the following means:

        (1)(i) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular display.

        (ii) When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding is required only on the title “Nutrition Facts” and is allowed for nutrient names for “Calories,” “Total fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Sodium,” “Total carbohydrate,” and “Protein.”

        (2) Using any of the following abbreviations:

        (3) Omitting the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section and placing another asterisk at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”

        (4) Presenting the required nutrition information on any other label panel.

        (h) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:

        (1) A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, constitutes a production lot.

        (2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot. Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the “Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,” or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the “Official Methods of Analysis” of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a particular method of analysis is specified in § 317.309(c), or, if no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by the Agency. The “Official Methods of Analysis” is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be purchased from the AOAC International, 2200 Wilson Blvd., suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201. It is also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

        (3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:

        (i) Class I. Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and

        (ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. If any ingredient which contains a naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrient is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to Class II requirements unless the same nutrient is also added, which would make the total amount of such nutrient subject to Class I requirements.

        (4) A product with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 1(n) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1)) unless it meets the following requirements:

        (i) Class I vitamin, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.

        (ii) Class II vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;  That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls below this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.

        (5) A product with a label declaration of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 1(n) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1)) if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;  That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls above this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.

        (6) The amount of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium may vary over labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice. The amount of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium may vary under labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice.

        (7) Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the label statement of serving size.

        (8) The management of the establishment must maintain records to support the validity of nutrient declarations contained on product labels. Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any duly authorized representative of the Agency upon request.

        (9) The compliance provisions set forth in paragraph (h) (1) through (8) of this section shall not apply to single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, including those that have been previously frozen, when nutrition labeling is based on the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference as provided in § 317.345(e) and (f).

        §§ 317.310-317.311   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 317.310-317.311

        § 317.312   Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.

#### § § 317.312

        (a) The general principles followed in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)), as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:

        (1) The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.

        (2) The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.

        (3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.

        (4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion were considered.

        (5) When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:

        (i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;

        (ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;

        (iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and

        (iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.

        (6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the Reference Amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.

        (7) The Reference Amount is based on the major intended use of the product (e.g., a mixed dish measurable with a cup as a main dish and not as a side dish).

        (8) The Reference Amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other products, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., ground beef), are based on use in the form purchased.

        (9) FSIS sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform Reference Amount.

        (b) The following Product Categories and Reference Amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:

        (c) For products that have no Reference Amount listed in paragraph (b) of this section for the unprepared or the prepared form of the product and that consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., lunch meat with cheese and crackers), the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be determined using the following rules:

        (1) For bulk products, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be the Reference Amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.

        (2) For products where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is one or more discrete units, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be either the number of small discrete units or the fraction of the large discrete unit that is represented as the main ingredient that is closest to the Reference Amount for that ingredient as established in paragraph (b) of this section plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.

        (3) If the Reference Amounts are in compatible units, they shall be summed (e.g., ingredients in equal volumes such as tablespoons). If the Reference Amounts are in incompatible units, the weights of the appropriate volumes should be used (e.g., grams of one ingredient plus gram weight of tablespoons of a second ingredient).

        (d) If a product requires further preparation, e.g., cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a Reference Amount for the product in the prepared form, then the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be determined using the following rules:

        (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) For products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare one large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the fraction of the large discrete unit closest to the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (e) The Reference Amount for an imitation or substitute product or altered product as defined in § 317.313(d), such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the same as for the product for which it is offered as a substitute.

        (f) The Reference Amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutritional claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the Reference Amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the Reference Amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the Reference Amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parentheses, by the amount in common household measure if the Reference Amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures.

        (g) The Administrator, on his or her own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a labeling application, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a Product Category or Reference Amount identified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.

        (2) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.

        (3) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.

        (4) Data accompanying the labeling application, such as food consumption data, shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.

        (5) The labeling application must be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.

        (6) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application, that to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her pertinent to the evaluation of the labeling application.

        (7) Labeling applications for a new Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be accompanied by the following data which shall be submitted in the following form to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, DC 20250:

        (8) Upon receipt of the labeling application and supporting documentation, the applicant shall be notified, in writing, of the date on which the labeling application was received. Such notice shall inform the applicant that the labeling application is undergoing Agency review and that the applicant shall subsequently be notified of the Agency's decision to consider for further review or deny the labeling application.

        (9) Upon review of the labeling application and supporting documentation, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the labeling application is either being considered for further review or that it has been summarily denied by the Administrator.

        (10) If the labeling application is summarily denied by the Administrator, the written notification shall state the reasons therefor, including why the Agency has determined that the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category is false or misleading. The notification letter shall inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        (i) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.

        (ii) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

        (11) If the labeling application is not summarily denied by the Administrator, the Administrator shall publish in the  a proposed rule to amend the regulations to authorize the use of the Reference Amount and/or Product Category. The proposal shall also summarize the labeling application, including where the supporting documentation can be reviewed. The Administrator's proposed rule shall seek comment from consumers, the industry, consumer and industry groups, and other interested persons on the labeling application and the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category. After public comment has been received and reviewed by the Agency, the Administrator shall make a determination on whether the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be approved for use on the labeling of meat food products.

        (i) If the Reference Amount and/or Product Category is denied by the Administrator, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the basis for the denial, including the reason why the Reference Amount and/or Product Category on the labeling was determined by the Agency to be false or misleading. The notification letter shall also inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        (A) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of an answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.

        (B) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

        (ii) If the Reference Amount and/or Product Category is approved, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, and shall also publish in the  a final rule amending the regulations to authorize the use of the Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        § 317.313   Nutrient content claims; general principles.

#### § § 317.313

        (a) This section applies to meat or meat food products that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale.

        (b) A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling pursuant to § 317.309, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.

        (1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”

        (2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:

        (i) Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or

        (ii) Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).

        (3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in subpart B of this part.

        (4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).

        (c) Information that is required or permitted by § 317.309 to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.

        (d) A “substitute” product is one that may be used interchangeably with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”

        (1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).

        (2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).

        (e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a product implies that the product differs from other products of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium beef noodle soup”).

        (2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “lard, a sodium free food”).

        (f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.

        (g) Labeling information required in §§ 317.313, 317.354, 317.356, 317.360, 317.361, 317.362, and 317.380, whose type size is not otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less than   inch in height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).

        (h) [Reserved]

        (i) Except as provided in § 317.309 or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:

        (1) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart B of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 10 g of fat per serving;”

        (2) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the product is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving, not a low sodium product.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than required by § 317.2(h) for the net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2);

        (3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.

        (4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 317.362(b)(6).

        (j) A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference product. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.

        (1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this paragraph (j).

        (i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a similar product.

        (B) For “light,” “reduced,” and “added” claims, the reference product shall be a similar product, and

        (ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference product shall be representative of the type of product that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.

        (B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.

        (2) For products bearing relative claims:

        (i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g., “50 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” or “  fewer calories than ‘reference product’ ”); and

        (ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).

        (iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:

        (A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;

        (B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;

        (C) A claim on the information panel; or

        (D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.

        (iv) The label or labeling must also bear:

        (A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that in the reference product; and

        (B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.

        (3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient.

        (k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “modified fat ‘product’ ”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “contains 35 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.

        (l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal-type” product will be defined as a product that:

        (1) Makes a major contribution to the diet by:

        (i) Weighing at least 10 ounces per labeled serving; and

        (ii) Containing not less than three 40 gram portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:

        (A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;

        (B) Fruits and vegetables;

        (C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;

        (D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:

        (E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and

        (2) Is represented as, or is in the form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal, or entre. Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.

        (m) For purposes of making a claim, a main-dish product will be defined as a food that:

        (1) Makes a major contribution to the meal by:

        (i) Weighing at least 6 ounces per labeled serving; and

        (ii) Containing not less than 40 grams of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.

        (A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;

        (B) Fruits and vegetables;

        (C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;

        (3) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish ( not a beverage or dessert). Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.

        (n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 317.309, shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.

        (o) Compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims shall be in accordance with § 317.309(h).

        (p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 317.312(b) through (e) shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 317.312(f) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 55 grams”).

        (2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size that is no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the criteria statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).

        (1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that appear as part of a brand name that was in use prior to November 27, 1991, may continue to be used as part of that brand name, provided they are not false or misleading under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1)).

        (2) [Reserved]

        (3) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 317.309 may be made on the label or in the labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral.

        (4) The requirements of this section do not apply to infant formulas and medical foods, as described in 21 CFR 101.13(q)(4).

        (5) [Reserved]

        (6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the name of a product that was subject to a standard of identity as of November 27, 1991, are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section whether or not they meet the definition of the descriptive term.

        (7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by FSIS. Labeling applications requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted pursuant to § 317.369.

        § 317.345   Nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped products described in § 317.301.

#### § § 317.345

        (a)(1) Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat products identified in § 317.344, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under § 317.400. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with § 317.309. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.

        (2) Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat products identified in § 317.344, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of § 317.309.

        (3) A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of § 317.309 apply. However, if only nutrition information—and not a nutrition claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of § 317.309 apply, provided, however:

        (i) The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in § 317.309(c)(8)) and footnote required by § 317.309(d)(9) may be omitted; and

        (ii) The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in § 317.309(f).

        (d) The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either the raw or cooked edible portions of meat cuts with external cover fat at trim levels reflecting current marketing practices. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the separable lean of meat cuts.

        (e) Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products, including those that have been previously frozen. These data may be composite data that reflect different quality grades of beef or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific grades or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to grade of meat or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible meat tissues present in the package.

        (f) If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under § 317.309(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.

        (g) Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw meat products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.

        (b)  (1) The terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “no calories,” “zero calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietarily insignificant source of calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, provided that:

        (i) The product contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size; and

        (ii) If the product meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the caloric content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

        (2) The terms “low calorie,” “few calories,” “contains a small amount of calories,” “low source of calories,” or “low in calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i)(A) The product has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 grams (g) or greater than 2 tablespoons (tbsp) and does not provide more than 40 calories per reference amount customarily consumed; or

        (B) The product has a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tbsp or less and does not provide more than 40 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per 50 g (for dehydrated products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 317.309(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per-50-g criterion refers to the “as prepared” form).

        (ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the caloric content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

        (3) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains 120 calories or less per 100 g of product; and

        (ii) If the product meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the calorie content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which it attaches.

        (4) The terms “reduced calorie,” “reduced in calories,” “calorie reduced,” “fewer calories,” “lower calorie,” or “lower in calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., lower calorie ‘product’—“33  percent fewer calories than our regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 150 to 100 calories per serving”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”

        (5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “calorie reduced ‘product’, 25% less calories per ounce (oz) (or 3 oz) than our regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 110 calories per 3 oz to 80 calories per 3 oz”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”

        (c)  (1) Terms such as “sugar free,” “free of sugar,” “no sugar,” “zero sugar,” “without sugar,” “sugarless,” “trivial source of sugar,” “negligible source of sugar,” or “dietarily insignificant source of sugar” may reasonably be expected to be regarded by consumers as terms that represent that the product contains no sugars or sweeteners, e.g., “sugar free,” or “no sugar,” as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:

        (i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;

        (ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: “Adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and

        (iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or

        (B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie product,” “not a low calorie product,” or “not for weight control.”

        (2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:

        (i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;

        (ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;

        (iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;

        (iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and

        (v) The product bears a statement that the product is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the product meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.

        (3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.

        (4) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar,” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving”).

        (5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sugar ‘product’—25% less sugar than our regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz”).

        (i) If the claim is denied by the Administrator, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the basis for the denial, including the reason why the claim on the labeling was determined by the Agency to be false or misleading. The notification letter shall also inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed implied nutrient content claim.

        (A) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.

        (B) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

        (ii) If the claim is approved, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, and shall also publish in the  a notice informing the public that the implied nutrient content claim has been approved for use.

        (a)  Any product that purports to be or is represented for special dietary use because of usefulness in reducing body weight shall bear:

        (1) Nutrition labeling in conformity with § 317.309 of this subpart, unless exempt under that section, and

        (2) A conspicuous statement of the basis upon which the product claims to be of special dietary usefulness.

        (b)  (1) Any product subject to paragraph (a) of this section that achieves its special dietary usefulness by use of a nonnutritive ingredient (i.e., one not utilized in normal metabolism) shall bear on its label a statement that it contains a nonnutritive ingredient and the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive ingredient.

        (2) A special dietary product may contain a nonnutritive sweetener or other ingredient only if the ingredient is safe for use in the product under the applicable law and regulations of this chapter. Any product that achieves its special dietary usefulness in reducing or maintaining body weight through the use of a nonnutritive sweetener shall bear on its label the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not state the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive sweetener. If a nutritive sweetener(s) as well as nonnutritive sweetener(s) is added, the statement shall indicate the presence of both types of sweetener; e.g., “Sweetened with nutritive sweetener(s) and nonnutritive sweetener(s).”

        (c)  A product purporting to be “low calorie” must comply with the criteria set forth for such foods in § 317.360.

        (d)  A product purporting to be “reduced calorie” or otherwise containing fewer calories than a reference food must comply with the criteria set forth for such foods in § 317.360(b) (4) and (5).

        (2) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms that is specifically authorized by regulation governing a particular food, or, unless otherwise restricted by regulation, to any use of the term “diet” that clearly shows that the product is offered solely for a dietary use other than regulating body weight, e.g., “for low sodium diets.”

        (3) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms on a formulated meal replacement or other product that is represented to be of special dietary use as a whole meal, pending the issuance of a regulation governing the use of such terms on foods.

        (f)  Criteria for the use of the terms “sugar free” and “no added sugar” are provided for in § 317.360(c).

    PART 318—ENTRY INTO OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS; REINSPECTION AND PREPARATION OF PRODUCTS

### Part 318

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1633, 1901-1906; 21 U.S.C. 601-695; 7 CFR 2.18, 2.53.

      Subpart A—General

**Source:** Source: 35 FR 15586, Oct. 3, 1970, unless otherwise noted.

        § 318.1   Products and other articles entering official establishments.

#### § § 318.1

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section or § 318.12, no product shall be brought into an official establishment unless it has been prepared only in an official establishment and previously inspected and passed by a Program employee, and is identified by an official inspection legend as so inspected and passed. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, product imported in accordance with part 327 of this subchapter and not prepared in the United States outside an official establishment, may enter any official establishment subject in other respects to the same restrictions as apply to domestic product. Products received in an official establishment during the Program employees absence shall be identified and maintained in a manner acceptable to such employee. Product entering any official establishment shall not be used or prepared thereat until it has been reinspected in accordance with § 318.2. Any product originally prepared at any official establishment may not be returned into any part of such establishment, except the receiving area approved under § 318.3, until it has been reinspected by the inspector.

        (b) No slaughtered poultry or poultry product shall be brought into an official establishment unless it has been (1) previously inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 ) and the regulations thereunder, and has not been prepared other than in an establishment inspected under said Act, or (2) has been inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of a State law.

        (c) Every article for use as an ingredient in the preparation of meat food products, when entering any official establishment and at all times while it is in such establishment, shall bear a label showing the name of the article, the amount or percentage therein of any substances restricted by this part or part 317 of this subchapter, and a list of ingredients in the article if composed of two or more ingredients:  That in the case of articles received in tank car lots, only one such label shall be used to identify each lot. In addition, the label must show the name and address of the shipper.

        (d) To ensure the safe use of preparations used in hog scalding water or in the denuding of tripe, the label or labeling on containers of such preparations shall bear adequate directions to ensure use in compliance with any limitations prescribed in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter A or Subchapter E.

        (e) Dyes, chemicals, or other substances the use of which is restricted to certain products may be brought into or kept in an official establishment only if such products are prepared thereat. No prohibited dye, chemical, preservative, or other substance shall be brought into or kept in an official establishment.

        (f) [Reserved]

        (g) Glands and organs, such as cotyledons, ovaries, prostate glands, tonsils, spinal cords, and detached lymphatic, pineal, pituitary, parathyroid, suprarenal, pancreatic and thyroid glands, used in preparing pharmaceutical, organotherapeutic, or technical products and which are not used as human food (whether or not prepared at official establishments) may be brought into and stored in edible product departments of inspected establishments if packaged in suitable containers so that the presence of such glands and organ will in no way interfere with the maintenance of sanitary conditions or constitute an interference with inspection. Glands or organs which are regarded as human food products, such as livers, testicles, and thymus glands, may be brought into official establishments for pharmaceutical, organotherapeutic or technical purposes, only if U.S. inspected and passed and so identified. Lungs and lung lobes derived from livestock slaughtered in any establishment may not be brought into any official establishment except as provided in § 318.12(a).

        (h)(1) Carcasses of game animals, and carcasses derived from the slaughter by any person of livestock of his own raising in accordance with the exemption provisions of paragraph 23(a) of the Act, and parts of such carcasses, may be brought into an official establishment for preparation, packaging, and storing in accordance with the provisions of § 303.1(a)(2) of this subchapter.

        (2) Meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products bearing official marks showing that they were inspected and passed under State inspection in any State not designated in § 331.2 of this subchapter may be received by official establishments for storage and distribution solely in intrastate commerce. The presence of such State inspected products must not create any unsanitary condition or otherwise result in adulteration of any products at the official establishment or interfere with the conduct of inspection under this subchapter. In addition, such State inspected products must be stored separately and apart from the federally inspected products in the official establishment.

        (i) The operator of the official establishment shall furnish such information as is necessary to determine the origin of any product or other article entering the official establishment. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the name and address of the seller or supplier, transportation company, agent, or broker involved in the sale or delivery of the product or article in question.

        (j) Any product or any poultry or poultry product or other article that is brought into an official establishment contrary to any provision of this section may be required by the Administrator to be removed immediately from such establishment by the operator thereof, and failure to comply with such requirement shall be deemed a violation of this regulation. If any slaughtered poultry or poultry products or other articles are received at an official establishment and are suspected of being adulterated or misbranded under the Poultry Products Inspection Act or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or applicable State laws, the appropriate governmental authorities will be notified.

        § 318.2   Reinspection, retention, and disposal of meat and poultry products at official establishments.

#### § § 318.2

        (a) All products and all slaughtered poultry and poultry products brought into any official establishment shall be identified by the operator of the official establishment at the time of receipt at the official establishment and shall be subject to reinspection by a Program employee at the official establishment in such manner and at such times as may be deemed necessary to assure compliance with the regulations in this subchapter.

        (b) All products, whether fresh, cured, or otherwise prepared, even though previously inspected and passed, shall be reinspected by Program employees as often as they may deem necessary in order to ascertain that they are not adulterated or misbranded at the time they enter or leave official establishments and that the requirements of the regulations in this subchapter are complied with.

        (c) Reinspection may be accomplished through use of statistically sound sampling plans that assure a high level of confidence. The circuit supervisor shall designate the type of plan and the program employee shall select the specific plan to be used in accordance with instructions issued by the Administrator.

        (d) A U.S. retained tag shall be placed by a Program employee at the time of reinspection at any official establishment on all products which are suspected on such reinspection of being adulterated or misbranded, and such products shall be held for further inspection. Such tags shall be removed only by authorized Program employees. When further inspection is made, if the product is found to be adulterated, all official inspection legends or other official marks for which the product is found to be ineligible under the regulations in this subchapter, shall be removed or defaced and the product will be subject to condemnation and disposal in accordance with part 314 of this subchapter, except that a determination regarding adulteration may be deferred if a product has become soiled or unclean by falling on the floor or in any other accidental way or if the product is affected with any other condition which the inspector deems capable of correction, in which case the product shall be cleaned (including trimming if necessary) or otherwise handled in a manner approved by the inspector to assure that it will not be adulterated or misbranded and shall then be presented for reinspection and disposal in accordance with this section. If upon final inspection, the product is found to be neither adulterated nor misbranded, the inspector shall remove the U.S. retained tag. If a product is found upon reinspection to be misbranded, it shall be held under a U.S. retained tag, or a U.S. detention tag as provided in part 329 of this subchapter, pending correction of the misbranding or issuance of an order under section 7 of the Act to withhold from use the labeling or container of the product, or the institution of a judicial seizure action under section 403 of Act or other appropriate action. The inspector shall make a complete record of each transaction under this paragraph and shall report his action to the area supervisor.

        § 318.3   Designation of places of receipt of products and other articles for reinspection.

#### § § 318.3

        Every official establishment shall designate, with the approval of the circuit supervisor, a dock or place at which products and other articles subject to reinspection under § 318.2 shall be received, and such products and articles shall be received only at such dock or place.

        § 318.4   Preparation of products to be officially supervised; responsibilities of official establishments; plant operated quality control.

#### § § 318.4

        (a) All processes used in curing, pickling, rendering, canning, or otherwise preparing any product in official establishments shall be supervised by Program employees unless such preparation is conducted as a custom operation exempted from inspection under § 303.1(a)(2) of this subchapter in any official establishment or consists of operations that are exempted from inspection under § 303.1(d) of this subchapter and are conducted in a retail store in an establishment subject to inspection only because the State or Territory in which the establishment is located is designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act. No fixtures or appliances, such as tables, trucks, trays, tanks, vats, machines, implements, cans, or containers of any kind, shall be used unless they are of such materials and construction as will not contaminate or otherwise adulterate the product and are clean and sanitary. All steps in the preparation of edible products shall be conducted carefully and with strict cleanliness in rooms or compartments separate from those used for inedible products.

        (b) It shall be the responsibility of the operator of every official establishment to comply with the Act and the regulations in this subchapter. In order to carry out this responsibility effectively, the operator of the establishment shall institute appropriate measures to assure the maintenance of the establishment and the preparation, marking, labeling, packaging and other handling of its products strictly in accordance with the sanitary and other requirements of this subchapter. The effectiveness of such measures will be subject to review by the Department.

        (c)  Any owner or operator of an official establishment preparing meat food product who has a total plant quality control system or plan for controlling such product, after ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, through all stages of preparation, may request the Administrator to evaluate it to determine whether or not that system is adequate to result in product being in compliance with the requirements of the Act and therefore qualify as a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Total Plant Quality Control Establishment. Such a request shall, as a minimum, include:

        (1) A letter to the Administrator from the establishment owner of operator stating the company's basis and purpose for seeking an approved quality control system and willingness to adhere to the requirements of the system as approved by the Department; that all the establishment's data, analyses, and information generated by its quality control system will be maintained to enable the Department to monitor compliance and available to Department personnel; that plant quality control personnel will have authority to halt production or shipping of product in cases where the submitted quality control system requires it; and that the owner or operator (or his/her designee) will be available for consultation at any time Department personnel consider it necessary.

        (2) In the case of an establishment having one or more full-time persons whose primary duties are related to the quality control system, an organizational chart showing that such people ultimately report to an establishment official whose quality control responsibilities are independent of or not predominantly production responsibilities. In the case of an establishment which does not have full-time quality control personnel, information indicating the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the person who will be responsible for the quality control system.

        (3) A list identifying those parts and sections of the Federal meat inspection regulations which are applicable to the operations of the establishment applying for approval of a quality control system. This list shall also identify which part of the quality control system will serve to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations.

        (4) Detailed information concerning the manner in which the system will function. Such information should include, but not necessarily be limited to, questions of raw material control, the critical check or control points, the nature and frequency of tests to be made, the nature of charts and other records that will be used, the length of time such charts and records will be maintained in the custody of the official establishment, the nature of deficiencies the quality control system is designed to identify and control, the parameters or limits which will be used, and the points at which corrective action will occur and the nature of such corrective action—ranging from least to most severe:  That, subsequent to approval of the total plant quality control system by the Administrator, the official establishment may produce a new product for test marketing provided labeling for the product has been approved by the Administrator, the inspector in charge has determined that the procedures for preparing the product will assure that all Federal requirements are met, and the production for test marketing does not exceed 6 months. Such new product shall not be produced at that establishment after the 6-month period unless approval of the quality control system for that product has been received from the Administrator.

        (d) [Reserved]

        (e)  (1) The Administrator shall evaluate the material presented in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If it is determined by the Administrator, on the basis of the evaluation, that the total quality control system will result in finished products controlled in this manner being in full compliance with the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the total quality control system will be approved and plans will be made for implementation under departmental supervision.

        (2) In any situation where the system is found by the Administrator to be unacceptable, formal notification shall be given to the applicant of the basis for the denial. The applicant will be afforded an opportunity to modify the system in accordance with the notification. The applicant shall also be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in response to this notification of denial and a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the applicant requests a hearing and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, he shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with Rules of Practice which shall be adopted for this proceeding.

        (3) The establishment owner or operator shall be responsible for the effective operation of the approved total plant quality control system to assure compliance with the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder. The Secretary shall continue to provide the Federal inspection necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.

        (f)  Owners and operators of official establishments having a total plant quality control system approved under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may only use, as a part of any label, the following logo.

        (g)  (1) The approval of a total plant quality control system may be terminated at any time by the owner or operator of the official establishment upon written notice to the Administrator.

        (2) The approval of a total plant quality control system may be terminated upon the establishment's receipt of a written notice from the Administrator under the following conditions:

        (i) If adulterated or misbranded meat food product is found by the Administrator to have been prepared for or distributed in commerce by the subject establishment. In such case, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of terminating the approval. In those instances where there is conflict of facts, a hearing, under applicable Rules of Practice, will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to resolve the conflict. The Administrator's termination of approval shall remain in effect pending the final determination of the proceeding.

        (ii) If the establishment fails to comply with the quality control system or program to which it has agreed after being notified by letter from the Administrator or his designee. Prior to such termination, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of the letter. In those instances where there is a conflict of facts, a hearing, under applicable Rules of Practice, will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to resolve the conflict. The Administrator's termination of quality control approval shall remain in effect pending the final determination of the proceeding.

        (3) If approval of the total establishment quality control system has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section, an application and request for approval of the same or a modified total establishment quality control system will not be evaluated by the Administrator for at least 6 months from the termination date.

        (h)(1)  An official establishment with an approved total plant quality control system may request approval for an operating schedule of up to 12 consecutive hours per shift. Permission will be granted provided that:

        (i) The official establishment has satisfactorily operated under a total plant quality control system for at least 1 year.

        (ii) All products prepared and packaged, or processed after the end of 8 hours of inspection shall only be a continuation of the processing monitored by the inspector and being conducted during the last hour of inspection.

        (iii) All immediate containers of products prepared and packaged shall bear code marks that are unique to any period of production beyond the 8 hours of inspection. The form of such code marks will remain constant from day to day, and a facsimile of the code marks and their meaning shall be provided to the inspector.

        (2)  Applications shall be submitted to the Regional Director and shall specify how the conditions in § 318.4(h)(1) have been or will be met.

        (3)  In order to verify that an establishment is preparing and shipping product in accordance with the approved total plant quality control system and the Act and regulations after the 8 hours of inspection, the official establishment may be provided overtime inspection services at the discretion of the circuit supervisor and charged for such services.

        (2) Frozen product may be defrosted in water or pickle in a manner and with the use of facilities which are acceptable to the inspector. Before such product is defrosted, a careful examination shall be made to determine its condition. If necessary, this examination shall include defrosting of representative samples by means other than in water or pickle.

        (b) Product, such as pork tenderloins, brains, sweetbreads, stew, or chop suey, shall not be packed in hermetically sealed metal or glass containers, unless subsequently heat processed or otherwise treated to preserve the product in a manner approved by the Administrator in specific cases.

        (c) Care shall be taken to remove bones and parts of bones from product which is intended for chopping.

        (d) Heads for use in the preparation of meat food products shall be split and the bodies of the teeth, the turbinated and ethmoid bones, ear tubes, and horn butts removed, and the heads then thoroughly cleaned.

        (e) Kidneys for use in the preparation of meat food products shall first be freely sectioned and then thoroughly soaked and washed. All detached kidneys, including beef kidneys with detached kidney fat, shall be inspected before being used in or shipped from the official establishment.

        (f) Cattle paunches and hog stomachs for use in the preparation of meat food products shall be thoroughly cleaned on all surfaces and parts immediately after being emptied of their contents, which shall follow promptly their removal from the carcasses.

        (g) Clotted blood shall be removed from hog hearts before they are shipped from the official establishment or used in the preparation of meat food products.

        (h) Beef rounds, beef bungs, beef middles, beef bladders, calf rounds, hog bungs, hog middles, and hog stomachs which are to be used as containers of any meat food product shall be presented for inspection, turned with the fat surface exposed.

        (i) Portions of casings which show infection with Oesophagostomum or other nodule-producing parasite, and weasands infected with the larvae of Hypoderma lineatum, shall be rejected, except that when the infestation is slight and the nodules and larvae are removed, the casing or weasand may be passed.

        § 318.6   Requirements concerning ingredients and other articles used in preparation of products.

#### § § 318.6

        (a) All ingredients and other articles used in the preparation of any product shall be clean, sound, healthful, wholesome, and otherwise such as will not result in the product being adulterated. Official establishments shall furnish inspectors accurate information on all procedures involved in product preparation including product composition and any changes in such procedures essential for inspectional control of the product.

        (b)(1) The only animal casings that may be used as containers of product are those from sheep, swine, or goats. Casings from cattle may be used as containers of products. However, if casings from cattle are derived from the small intestine, the small intestine must comply with the requirements in 9 CFR 310.22(d). Establishments that use casings derived from the small intestine of cattle as containers for products must demonstrate, through documentation, that the small intestine from which the casing was derived complies with the requirements in 9 CFR 310.22(d).

        (2) Casings for products shall be carefully inspected by Program employees. Only those casings which have been carefully washed and thoroughly flushed with clean water immediately before stuffing and are suitable for containers, are clean, and are passed on such inspection shall be used, except that preflushed animal casings packed in salt or salt and glycerine solution or other approved medium may be used without additional flushing provided they are found to be clean and otherwise acceptable and are thoroughly rinsed before use.

        (3) Hog and sheep casings intended for use as containers of product may be treated by soaking in or applying thereto sound, fresh pineapple juice or papain or bromelin or pancreatic extract to permit the enzymes contained in these substances to act on the casings to make them less resistant. The casings shall be handled in a clean and sanitary manner throughout and the treatment shall be followed by washing and flushing the casings with water sufficiently to effectively remove the substance used and terminate the enzymatic action.

        (4) On account of the invariable presence of bone splinters, detached spinal cords shall not be used in the preparation of edible product other than for rendering where they constitute a suitable raw material. Detached spinal cords from cattle 30 months of age and older shall not be used as raw materials for edible rendering.

        (5) Testicles if handled as an edible product may be shipped from the official establishment as such, but they shall not be used as an ingredient of a meat food product.

        (6) Tonsils shall be removed and shall not be used as ingredients of meat food products.

        (7) Blood from livestock prepared in accordance with § 310.20 of this subchapter may be used as an ingredient of a meat food product for which a standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter, if permitted by such standard, and may be used in any meat food product for which no such standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter if it is a common and usual ingredient of such product.

        (8) Intestines shall not be used as ingredients in any meat food product for which a standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter and shall not be used in other products unless the products are labeled in accordance with § 317.8(b)(3) of this subchapter. When small intestine from cattle is used in a meat food product or for edible rendering, it must comply with the requirements in 9 CFR 310.22(d).

        (9) Poultry products and egg products (other than shell eggs) which are intended for use as ingredients of meat food products shall be considered acceptable for such use only when identified as having been inspected and passed for wholesomeness by the Department under the regulations in 7 CFR part 59 or 9 CFR part 362 or 381 and when found to be sound and otherwise acceptable when presented for use. Poultry products and egg products (other than shell eggs) which have not been so inspected and passed for wholesomeness shall not be used in the preparation of such meat food products.

        (10) Dry milk products which are intended for use as ingredients of meat food products shall be considered acceptable for such use only when produced in a plant approved by the Department under the regulations in 7 CFR part 58, and when found to be sound and otherwise acceptable when presented for use. Dry milk products prepared in a plant not so approved shall not be used in the preparation of such meat food products.

        (11) [Reserved]

        (12) Ingredients for use in any product may not bear or contain any pesticide chemical or other residues in excess of level permitted in § 318.16.

        (13) Use of “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry),” as defined in § 381.173 of this chapter, in the preparation of meat food products shall accord with § 381.174 and all other applicable provisions of this subchapter.

        § 318.8   Preservatives and other substances permitted in product for export only; handling; such product not to be used for domestic food purposes.

#### § § 318.8

        (a) Preservatives and other substances not permitted in domestic product under the regulations in this subchapter may be used in the preparation and packing of product intended for export provided the product (1) accords to the specifications or directions of the foreign purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export; and (3) is labeled on the outside container to show that it is intended for export, and is otherwise labeled as required by this subchapter for such export product.

        (b) The preparation and packing of export product as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be done in a manner acceptable to the inspector in charge so that the identity of the export product is maintained conclusively and the preparation of domestic product is adequately protected. The preservatives and other substances not permitted in domestic product shall be stored in a room or compartment separate from areas used to store other supplies and shall be held under Program lock. Use of the preservatives or other substances shall be under the direct supervision of a Program employee.

        (c) The packing of all articles under paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted under the direct supervision of a Program employee.

        (d) No article prepared or packed for export under paragraph (a) of this section shall be sold or offered for sale for domestic use or consumption, but unless exported shall be destroyed for food purposes under the direct supervision of a Program employee.

        (e) The contents of the container of any article prepared or packed for export under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be removed, in whole or in part, from such container prior to exportation, except under the supervision of a Program employee. If such contents are removed prior to exportation, then the article shall be either repacked, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or destroyed for food purposes under the direct supervision of a Program employee.

        (f) Permission must be obtained from the Administrator before meats packed in borax are shipped from one official establishment to another or to an unofficial establishment for storage, except such meat prepared for the account of Federal agencies.

        (g) At all times, the identity of meat to which borax has been added shall be effectively maintained. In no case shall such meat, nor any trimmings or fat derived from such meat, whether unwashed or washed, or otherwise treated, be diverted to domestic use.

        (h) Salt used for bulking meat previously packed in borax may not again be used in an edible products department other than in connection with the packing of meat in borax. Only metal equipment should be used for handling such meat. Particularly effective cleansing will be required if wooden equipment such as trucks, washing vats, etc., is used. Boxes from which boraxed meat has been removed may be used for repacking meat in borax, but their use as containers for other meat will be dependent upon the effective removal of all traces of borax.

        (i) The following instructions pertain to export cured pork packed in borax for the account of Federal agencies. The meat may be packed in borax in a room in which there is borax-free meat, provided proper care is taken to see that the borax-free meat is not affected by the borax. Under the same condition, meat packed in borax may be received, unpacked, defrosted, soaked, washed, smoked, and repacked in a room where there is other meat. However, meat originally packed in borax shall at all times be subject to the restrictions of meat so packed, even though repacked without borax. After packing or repacking, borax packed meat may be stored in a room with meat not packed in borax, provided a reasonable degree of separation is maintained between the two classes of product.

#### § § 318.14

        (a) In the event there is polluted water (including but not limited to flood water) in an official establishment, all products and ingredients for use in the preparation of such products that have been rendered adulterated by the water shall be condemned.

        (b) After the polluted water has receded from an official establishment, all walls, ceilings, posts, and floors of the rooms and compartments involved, including the equipment therein, shall, under the supervision of an inspector, be cleaned thoroughly by the official establishment personnel. An adequate supply of hot water under pressure is essential to make such cleaning effective. After cleaning, a solution of sodium hypochlorite containing approximately one-half of 1 percent available chlorine (5,000 p/m) or other equivalent disinfectant approved by the Administrator   shall be applied to the surface of the rooms and equipment and rinsed with potable water before use.

        (c) Hermetically sealed containers of product which have been contaminated by polluted water shall be examined promptly by the official establishment under supervision of an inspector and rehandled as follows:

        (1) Separate and condemn all product in damaged or extensively rusted containers.

        (2) Remove paper labels and wash the remaining containers in warm soapy water, using a brush where necessary to remove rust or other foreign material. Disinfect these containers by either of the following methods:

        (i) Immerse in a solution of sodium hypochlorite containing not less than 100 p/m of available chlorine or other equivalent disinfectant approved by the Administrator,   rinse in potable water, and dry thoroughly; or

        (ii) Immerse in 212 °F. water, bring temperature of the water back to 212 °F. and maintain the temperature at 212 °F. for 5 minutes, then remove containers from water and cool them to 95 °F. and dry thoroughly.

        (3) After handling as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the containers may be relacquered, if necessary, and then relabeled with approved labels applicable to the product therein.

        (4) The identity of the canned product shall be maintained throughout all stages of the rehandling operations to insure correct labeling of the containers.

        § 318.19   Compliance procedure for cured pork products.

#### § § 318.19

        (a)  For the purposes of this section:

        (1) A  is that cured pork article which is contained within one  as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and which purports to meet the criteria for a single _product_ designated under the heading “Product Name and Qualifying Statements” in the chart in § 319.104 or the chart in § 319.105.

        (2) A  or a  means one of the following:

        (3) A  is that product from one production shift.

        (4) A  is frequency of production, expressed in days per week.

        (5)  of a product means the meat protein (indigenous to the raw, unprocessed pork cut) content expressed as a percent of the non-fat portion of the finished product.

        (b)  The Department shall collect samples of cured pork products and analyze them for their PFF content. Analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists §§ 950.46, and 928.08 (Chapter 39).   The “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 15th edition, 1990, is incorporated by reference with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Each analytical result shall be recorded and evaluated to determine whether future sampling of product Groups within an official establishment shall be periodic or daily under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and if the affected lot and subsequent production of like product shall be U.S. retained, or administratively detained, as appropriate, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (1)  For each official plant preparing cured pork products, Product Groups shall be sampled periodically or daily. Analytical results shall be evaluated and the sampling frequency determined as follows:

        (i) Determine the difference between the individual PFF analysis and the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the individual sample result is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the individual sample result is greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement.

        (ii) Divide the resulting number by the standard deviation assigned to the Product Group represented by the sample to find the Standardized Difference. The standard deviation assigned to Groups I and II is 0.75 and to Groups III and IV is 0.91.

        (iii) Add 0.25 to the Standardized Difference to find the Adjusted Standardized Difference.

        (iv) Use the lesser of 1.90 and the Adjusted Standardized Difference as the Sample Value.

        (v) Cumulatively total Sample Values to determine the Group Value. The first Sample Value in a Group shall be the Group Value, and each succeeding Group Value shall be determined by adding the most recent Sample Value to the existing Group Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Group Value exceed 1.00. When calculation of a Group Value results in a figure greater than 1.00, the Group Value shall be 1.00 and all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Group Values.

        (vi) The frequency of sampling of a Group shall be periodic when the Group Value is greater than −1.40 (e.g., −1.39, −1.14, 0, 0.50, etc.) and shall be daily when the Group Value is −1.40 or less (e.g., −1.40, −1.45, −1.50, etc.); provided, however, that once daily sampling has been initiated, it shall continue until the Group Value is 0.00 or greater, and each of the last seven Sample Values is −1.65 or greater (e.g., −1.63, −1.50, etc.), and there is no other product within the affected Group being U.S. retained as produced, under provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (c).

        (2)  Cured prok products shall be U.S. retained, or administratively detained, as appropriate, when prescribed by paragraphs (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section as follows:

        (i)  In the event that an analysis of an individual sample indicates a PFF content below the applicable minimum requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105 by 2.3 or more percentage points for a Group I or II product, or 2.7 or more percentage points for a Group III or IV product, the lot from which the sample was collected shall be U.S. retained if in an official establishment and shall be subject to administrative detention if not in an official establishment unless returned to an official establishment and there U.S. retained. Any subsequently produced lots of like product and any lots of like product for which production dates cannot be established shall be U.S. retained or subject to administrative detention. Such administratively detained product shall be handled in accordance with part 329 of this subchapter, or shall be returned to an official establishment and subjected to the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, or shall be relabeled in compliance with the applicable standard, under the supervision of a program employee, at the expense of the product owner. Disposition of such U.S. retained product shall be in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (ii)  The Department shall maintain, for each product prepared in an official establishment, a Product Value. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, calculation of the Product Value and its use to determine if a product shall be U.S. retained shall be as follows:

        (A) Determine the difference between the individual PFF analysis and applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 and § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the individual sample result is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the individual sample result is greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement.

        (B) Divide the difference determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the standard deviation assigned to the product's Group in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section to find the standardized difference.

        (C) Use the lesser of 1.65 and the standardized difference as the Sample Value.

        (D) Cumulatively total Sample Values to determine the Product Value. The first Sample Value of a product shall be the Product Value, and each succeeding Product Value shall be determined by adding the most recent Sample Value to the existing Product Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Product Value exceed 1.15. When calculation of a Product Value results in a figure greater than 1.15, the Product Value shall be 1.15, and all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Product Values.

        (E) Provided daily group sampling is in effect pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and provided further the Product Value is −1.65 or less (e.g., −1.66), the affected lot (if within the official establishment) and all subsequent lots of like product prepared by and still within the official establishment shall be U.S. retained and further evaluated under paragraph (c) of this section. Except for release of individual lot pursuant to paragraph (c)(1), subsequently produced lots of like product shall continue to be U.S. retained until discontinued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (c)  When a product lot is U.S. retained under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Department shall collect three randomly selected samples from each such lot and analyze them individually for PFF content. The PFF content of the three samples shall be evaluated to determine disposition of the lot as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the action to be taken on subsequently produced lots of like product as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (1) A product lot which is U.S. retained under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be released for entry into commerce provided one of the following conditions is met:

        (i) The average PFF content of the three samples randomly selected from the lot is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage required by § 319.104 or § 319.105. Further processing to remove moisture for the purpose of meeting this provision is permissible. In lieu of further analysis to determine the effects of such processing, each 0.37 percent weight reduction due to moisture loss resulting from the processing may be considered the equivalent of a 0.1 percent PFF gain.

        (ii) The lot of the product is relabeled to conform to the provisions of § 319.104 or § 319.105, under the supervision of a program employee.

        (iii) The lot is one that has been prepared subsequent to preparation of the lot which, under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, resulted in discontinuance of U.S. retention of new lots of like product. Such lot may be released for entry into commerce prior to receipt of analytical results for which sampling has been conducted. Upon receipt of such results, they shall be subjected to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) of this section.

        (2) The PFF content of three randomly selected samples from each U.S. retained lot shall be used to maintain the Product Value described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii). The manner and effect of such maintenance shall be as follows: (i) Find the average PFF content of the three samples.

        (ii) Determine the difference between that average and the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the average of the sample results is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the average of the sample results is greater than the applicable minimum PFF requirements.

        (iii) Divide the resulting figure by the standard deviation assigned to the product's Group in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, to find the standardized difference.

        (iv) Use the lesser of 1.30 and the standardized difference as the Sample Value.

        (v) Add the first Sample Value thus calculated to the latest Product Value calculated under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to find the new Product Value. To find each succeeding Product Value, add the most recent Sample Value to the existing Product Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Product Value exceed 1.15. When the addition of a Sample Value to an existing Product Value results in a figure greater than 1.15, the Product Value shall be 1.15 and all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Product Values.

        (vi) New lots of like product shall continue to be retained pending disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section until, after 5 days of production, the Product Value is 0.00 or greater, and the PFF content of no individual sample from a U.S. retained lot is less than the Absolute Minimum PFF requirement specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Should an individual sample fail to meet its Absolute Minimum PFF requirement, the 5-day count shall begin anew.

        (vii) When U.S. retention of new lots is discontinued under the above provisions, maintenance of the Product Value shall revert to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (3) For purposes of this section, the plant owner or operator shall have the option of temporarily removing a product from its Product Group, provided product lots are being U.S. retained, as produced, and provided further that the average production rate of the product, over the 8-week period preceding the week in which the first U.S. retained lot was prepared, is not greater than 20 percent of the production rate of its Group. When a product is thus removed from its Group, analytical results of product samples shall not cause daily sampling of the Group. When pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, new lots of the product are no longer being U.S. retained, the product shall again be considered with its Group.

        (d)  Products not meeting specified PFF requirements, determined according to procedures set forth in this section, may be deemed adulterated under section 1(m)(8) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(8)) and misbranded under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)).

        (e)  Cured pork products bearing on their labeling the statement “X% of Weight is Added Ingredients” shall be prepared only under a quality control system or program in accordance with § 318.4 of this subchapter. With respect to any other cured pork product, official establishments may institute quality control procedures under § 318.4 of this subchapter. Cured pork products produced in such establishments may be exempt from the requirements of this section, provided in plant quality control procedures are shown to attain the same or higher degree of compliance as the procedures set forth in this section; provided, however, that all cured pork products produced shall be subject to the applicable Absolute Minimum PFF content requirement, regardless of any quality control procedures in effect.

#### § § 318.24

        (a)  Meat, as defined in § 301.2 of this subchapter, may be derived by mechanically separating skeletal muscle tissue from the bones of livestock, other than skulls or vertebral column bones of cattle 30 months of age and older as provided in § 310.22 of this subchapter, using advances in mechanical meat/bone separation machinery ( AMR systems) that, in accordance with this section, recover meat—

        (1) Without significant incorporation of bone solids or bone marrow as measured by the presence of calcium and iron in excess of the requirements in this section, and

        (2) Without the presence of any brain, trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, or dorsal root ganglia (DRG).

        (b)  As a prerequisite to labeling or using product as meat derived by the mechanical separation of skeletal muscle tissue from livestock bones, the operator of an establishment must develop, implement, and maintain procedures that ensure that the establishment's production process is in control.

        (1) The production process is not in control if the skulls entering the AMR system contain any brain or trigeminal ganglia tissue, if the vertebral column bones entering the AMR system contain any spinal cord, if the recovered product fails otherwise under any provision of paragraph (c)(1), if the product is not properly labeled under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2), or if the spent bone materials are not properly handled under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (2) The establishment must document its production process controls in writing. The program must be designed to ensure the on-going effectiveness of the process controls. If the establishment processes cattle, the program must be in its HACCP plan, its Sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program. The program shall describe the on-going verification activities that will be performed, including the observation of the bones entering the AMR system for brain, trigeminal ganglia, and spinal cord; the testing of the product exiting the AMR system for bone solids, bone marrow, spinal cord, and DRG as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; the use of the product and spent bone materials exiting the AMR system; and the frequency with which these activities will be performed.

        (3) The establishment shall maintain records on a daily basis sufficient to document the implementation and verification of its production process.

        (4) The establishment shall make available to inspection program personnel the documentation described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section and any other data generated using these procedures.

        (c)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, product that is recovered using advanced meat/bone separation machinery is not meat under any one or more of the following circumstances:

        (i)  The product's calcium content, measured by individual samples and rounded to the nearest 10th, is more than 130.0 mg per 100 g.

        (ii)  The product's added iron content, measured by duplicate analyses on individual samples and rounded to the nearest 10th, is more than 3.5 mg per 100 g.

        (iii)  Skulls that enter the AMR system have tissues of brain or trigeminal ganglia.

        (iv)  Vertebral column bones that enter the AMR system have tissues of spinal cord, or the product that exits the AMR system contains spinal cord.

        (v)  The product that exits the AMR system contains _DRG._

        (2) If product that may not be labeled or used as “meat” under this section meets the requirements of § 319.5 of this subchapter, it may bear the name “Mechanically Separated (Species)” except as follows:

        (i) If skulls or vertebral column bones of cattle younger than 30 months of age that enter the AMR system have tissues of brain, trigeminal ganglia, or spinal cord, the product that exits the AMR system shall not be used as an ingredient of a meat food product.

        (ii) If product that exits the AMR system contains spinal cord or DRG from bones of cattle younger than 30 months of age, it shall not be used as an ingredient of a meat food product.

        (iii) If product derived from any bones of cattle of any age does not comply with (c)(1)(i) or (ii), it may bear a common or usual name that is not false or misleading, except that the product may not bear the name “Mechanically Separated (Beef).”

        (3) Spent skulls or vertebral column bone materials from cattle younger than 30 months of age that exit the AMR system shall not be used as an ingredient of a meat food product.

        § 319.10   Requirements for substitute standardized meat food products named by use of an expressed nutrient content claim and a standardized term.

#### § § 319.10

        (a)  The meat food products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 317.313(d), for a standardized product defined in this part and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 317.313 of this subchapter and with the requirements of part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The meat food product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the meat food product shall be similar to those of the standardized meat food product produced under this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 317.313(d)(1) and (2) of this subchapter that informs the consumer of such differences (, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.

        (c)  (1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in meat food products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in this part for which it is a substitute.

        (2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, turnip chunks shall not replace potatoes in corned beef hash.

        (3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any meat food product by this part shall not be added to the substitute meat food product under this section.

        (4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute meat food product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.

        (5) Water and fat-replacers (, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (d)  The name of a substitute meat food product that complies with all parts of this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.

        (e)  (1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute meat food product shall be declared on the label as required by this section and part 317 of this subchapter.

        (2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular ________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular ________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.

      § 321.1   Assistance to State and Territorial programs.

#### § § 321.1

      (a) The Administrator is authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act, when he determines it would effectuate the purposes of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering the meat inspection program of such jurisdiction with a view to assuring that it imposes and enforces requirements at least equal to those under Titles I and IV of the Act, with respect to establishments at which products are prepared for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction, and with respect to the products of such establishments. Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a law imposing mandatory ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements at least equal to the Federal requirements with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering livestock or otherwise preparing products solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.

      (b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those in Title II of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased livestock; and products not intended for human food), when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.

      (c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or Territory) may not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or Territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.

#### § § 321.2

      Under the “Talmadge-Aiken Act” of September 28, 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450), the Administrator is authorized to utilize employees and facilities of any State in carrying out Federal functions under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a Federal-State program.

      § 321.3   Cooperation of States for the interstate shipment of carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products.

#### § § 321.3

      (a) The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 683(b) to coordinate with States that have meat inspection programs as provided in § 321.1 of this part to select certain establishments operating under these programs to participate in a cooperative program to ship carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products in interstate commerce. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”

      (b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs. Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services to selected establishments in the State.

      (c) Part 332 of this subchapter prescribes conditions under which States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program.

      (d) The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.

      (b)(1) No carrier shall transport or receive for transportation in commerce (including transportation in the course of importation) and no person shall offer for transportation any carcass, part thereof, meat or meat food product until a certificate, if required for such transportation by this part, is made and furnished to the carrier in one of the forms prescribed in this part.

      (2) Product imported into the United States may be transported and offerred or received for transportation if such product is conveyed in railroad cars, trucks or other means of conveyance, prior to inspection, to an authorized place of inspection, as provided in § 327.6 of this part.

      (c) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, meat or meat food products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation in commerce or in any State designated under § 331.2 of this subchapter, any such meat or meat food product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated. Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment. The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Program's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated. Circumstances of transport that can be reasonably anticipated shall be considered in making said determination. These include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, duration and distance of trip, nature of product covering, and effect of restowage at stops en route. Any means of conveyance found upon such inspection to be in such condition that product placed therein could become adulterated shall not be used until such condition which could cause adulteration is corrected. Product placed in any means of conveyance that is found by the inspector to be in such condition that the product may have become adulterated shall be removed from the means of conveyance and handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter.

Containers shall be sealed by firmly applying a pressure sensitive tape around each container in two directions and stamping the intersection of the tape with the marking device described in § 312.2(a) of this subchapter for use on burlap, muslin, etc. (2 -inch rubber brand). Such tape must possess the adhesive property to actually remove a portion of the container surface when the tape is removed. Alternatively, an inelastic, nonmetallic strap which will retain a legible imprint of the marking device (2 -inch rubber brand) may be used. The imprint of the marking device shall be placed partially on the strap and partially on the container. Such restricted product shall be marked “U.S. passed for cooking” or “pork product ____ °F. ____days refrigeration” or “beef passed for refrigeration,” as the case may be. In addition, a “U.S. retained” tag shall be securely affixed to each container of product passed for cooking and of beef passed for refrigeration. The means of conveyance shall not be sealed unless at least 25 percent of the other product in the vehicle is unmarked. For each consignment there shall be promptly issued and forwarded by the inspector to the inspector in charge at destination, a report on the form entitled “Notice of Unmarked Meats Shipped in Sealed Cars,” appropriately modified to show the character of the containers, and that the contents are restricted. A duplicate copy shall be retained in the program files.

      (c) When products are offered for transportation under this section, the initial carrier shall require and the shipper shall make in duplicate and deliver to the carrier one copy of a certificate in the form set out in § 325.5(b). Certificates in this form or copies thereof need not be forwarded to any official or office of the Department, but the original of the certificate shall be retained by the carrier and a copy shall be retained by the shipper in accordance with part 320 of this subchapter. If the shipper is also the carrier, he shall nevertheless execute and retain the certificate in accordance with part 320 of this subchapter.

#### § § 325.9

      § 325.10   Handling of products which may have become adulterated or misbranded; authorization and other requirements.

#### § § 325.10

      (a) When it is claimed that any inspected and passed product, marked with an inspection legend, has become adulterated or misbranded after it has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral permission is obtained from the area supervisor of the area in which that offical establishment is located. The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of officially determining if the product has become adulterated or misbranded and making the appropriate disposition. The area supervisor shall make a record of the authorization and such other information which will effectively identify the shipment and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.

      (b) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by a Program inspector, and if it is found that the article is not adulterated, the same may be received into the establishment; but if the article is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be stamped “U.S. inspected and condemned” and disposed of in accordance with part 314 of this subchapter, and if it is found to be misbranded, it shall be handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter:  That when a product is found to be affected with one of the correctable conditions specified in § 318.2(d) of this subchapter, in respect to which rehandling is permitted, it may be transported from the official establishment to another official establishment for such rehandling as is necessary to assure that the product is not adulterated or misbranded when finally released. The transportation of such a product from an official establishment shall be done in a manner prescribed in each specific case by the Administrator.

      § 325.11   Inedible articles: denaturing and other means of identification; exceptions.

#### § § 325.11

      (a) Except as provided in § 325.8 and § 325.10, no carcass, part of a carcass, rendered grease, tallow, or other fat derived from the carcasses of livestock, or other meat food product, that has not been inspected and passed at an official establishment under the provisions of this subchapter and is not exempted from such inspection, and no carcass, part of a carcass, fat or other meat food product that is adulterated or misbranded, shall be offered for transportation in commerce by any person unless it is handled in accordance with paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section or is denatured or otherwise identified as prescribed in § 325.13, § 314.1, § 314.3, § 314.9, § 314.10, or § 314.11 of this subchapter.

      (b) Inedible rendered animal fats from official or other establishments in the United States having the physical characteristics of a meat food product fit for human food may be transported in commerce without denaturing, if the following conditions are met:

      (1) Such inedible rendered fat shall not be bought, sold, transported, or offered for sale or offered for transportation in commerce, or imported, except by rendering companies, dealers, brokers, or others who obtain a numbered permit for such activities from the Regional Director.

      (2) Such inedible rendered animal fat may be so distributed only if consigned to a domestic manufacturer of technical articles other than for human food or to an export terminal for exportation or storage for exportation as an inedible article, and provided, in the case of such fat consigned to a domestic manufacturer, the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing purposes of nonhuman food articles and may not be further sold or shipped without first receiving approval of the Regional Director:  That such fat intended for export and stored at a terminal point prior to export will be subject to review by Program employees to assure that it is exported as inedible.

      (3) When transported in commerce, or imported, such inedible rendered fat shall be marked conspicuously with the words “technical animal fat not intended for human food” on the ends of the shipping containers, in letters not less than 2 inches high; in the case of shipping containers such as drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks. All shipping containers shall have both ends painted with a durable paint, if necessary, to provide a contrasting background for the required marking.

      (4) Such inedible rendered fat shall be transported only in sealed shipping containers bearing unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned by said Director for the permit holder. The number shall appear on the bill of lading or other transportation documents for the shipment. The consignees in the United States must retain the seals in their records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.

      (5) Any diversion or effort to divert inedible rendered fat contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (b) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of technical animal fat at the discretion of the Administrator.

      (c) Inedible rendered animal fat derived from condemned or other inedible materials at official or other establishments in the United States may be transported in commerce if mixed with low grade offal or other materials which render the fat readily distinguishable from an article of human food, and if the outside container bears the word “inedible.”

      (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, or in §§ 314.10 and 314.11 of this subchapter, no animal food prepared, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of livestock in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, unless:

      (i) It is properly identified as animal food;

      (ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and

      (iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 325.13(a)(2) so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of livestock and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the meat food industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2).

      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2) if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appeared on the label in a conspicuous manner.

      (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (d)(3), the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from the carcasses of livestock.

      (ii) Notwithstanding the provisons of paragraph (i) of this paragraph (d)(3), the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains livestock-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Horsemeat for Pets” or “Beef Stew for Dogs”:  That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass, but shall not be less than   inches high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.

      (iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of livestock carcass-source material contrast with their background.

      (4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feeds manufactured from processed livestock byproducts (such as meat meal tankage, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and feed grade animal fat), or to processed dry animal food.

      (e) Except for inedible rendered animal fats and lungs or lung lobes, inedible products (including condemned products only if condemned for causes specified in § 314.11 of this subchapter) which were prepared at any official establishment, or at any State inspected establishment in any State not listed in § 331.2 of this subchapter, and which have the physical characteristics of a product fit for human food, may be transported from an official establishment or in commerce, without denaturing as required by this subchapter, if the following conditions are met:

      (1) The shipper must have obtained a numbered permit for such activity from the appropriate Regional Director, as identified in § 301.2 of this subchapter. Such permit may be obtained upon written application to the appropriate Regional Director and his determination that the proposed transportation would be authorized under this paragraph (e). The application shall state the name and address of the applicant, a description of the type of his business operations, and the purpose of making such application.

      (2) Such inedible products may be transported under this paragraph (e) only if consigned to a manufacturer in the United States of articles other than for human food and if the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing articles not for human food. Such products may not be transported in commerce to any consignee other than the one to which they were originally shipped unless prior notice of the diversion is given to the appropriate Regional Director and a record identifying the new consignee is maintained by the shipper as required by § 320.1 of this subchapter.

      (3) When transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e), the outside container of such inedible products shall be marked conspicuously with the words “Inedible—Not Intended for Human Food” in letters not less than 2 inches high, in the case of containers, such as cartons, drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks used to transport such products not in other containers.

      (4) Such inedible products shall be transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e) only in railroad cars, trucks, or containers which bear unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned to the permit holder and an individual seal serial number assigned by the shipper; and the product so transported shall be accompanied by an invoice or bill of lading specifying the permit holder's identification number. The consignee in the United States must retain a record of the identification and serial numbers shown on the seals in his records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.

      (5) Any diversion, or effort to divert, undenatured, inedible product contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (e) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of inedible products under this paragraph (e), at the discretion of the Administrator.

      § 325.13   Denaturing procedures.

#### § § 325.13

      (a) Carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products (other than rendered animal fats) that have been treated in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall be considered denatured for the purposes of the regulations in this part, except as otherwise provided in part 314 of this subchapter for articles condemned at official establishments.

      (1) The following agents are prescribed for denaturing carcasses, parts thereof, meat or meat food products which are affected with any condition that would result in their condemnation and disposal under part 314 of this subchapter if they were at an official establishment: Crude carbolic acid; cresylic disinfectant; a formula consisting of 1 part FD&C green No. 3 coloring, 40 parts water, 40 parts liquid detergent, and 40 parts oil of citronella, or other proprietary substance approved by the Administrator in specific cases.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section, the following agents are prescribed for denaturing other carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products, for which denaturing is required by this part: FD&C green No. 3 coloring; FD&C blue No. 1 coloring; FD&C blue No. 2 coloring; finely powdered charcoal; or other proprietary substance approved by the Administrator in specific cases.

      (3) Tripe may be denatured by dipping it in a 6 percent solution of tannic acid for 1 minute followed by immersion in a water bath, then immersing it for 1 minute in a solution of 0.022 percent FD&C yellow No. 5 coloring;

      (4) Meat may be denatured by dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent tannic acid, followed by immersion in a water bath, then dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent ferric acid; and

      (5) When meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products are in ground form, 4 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 5 mesh in the standards issued by the U.S. Bureau of Standards or 6 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 8 mesh in said Standards, uniformly incorporated with the product may be used in lieu of the agents prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (6) Before the denaturing agents are applied to articles in pieces more than 4 inches in diameter, the pieces shall be freely slashed or sectioned. (If the articles are in pieces not more than 4 inches in diameter, slashing or sectioning will not be necessary.) The application of any of the denaturing agents listed in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section to the outer surface of molds or blocks of boneless meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products shall not be adequate. The denaturing agent must be mixed intimately with all of the material to be denatured, and must be applied in such quantity and manner that it cannot easily and readily be removed by washing or soaking. A sufficient amount of the appropriate agent shall be used to give the material a distinctive color, odor, or taste so that such material cannot be confused with an article of human food.

      (7) Carcasses (other than viscera), parts thereof, cuts of meat, and unground pieces of meat darkened by charcoal or other black dyes shall be deemed to be denatured pursuant to this section only if they contain at least that degree of darkness depicted by diagram 1 of the Meat Denaturing Guide (MP Form 91).

      (b) Inedible rendered animal fats shall be denatured by thoroughly mixing therein denaturing oil, No. 2 fuel oil, brucine dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and pine oil or oil of rosemary, finely powdered charcoal, or any proprietary denaturing agent approved for the purpose by the Administrator in specific cases. The charcoal shall be used in no less quantity than 100 parts per million and shall be of such character that it will remain suspended indefinitely in the liquid fat. Sufficient of the chosen identifying agents shall be used to give the rendered fat so distinctive a color, odor, or taste that it cannot be confused with an article of human food.

      § 327.2   Eligibility of foreign countries for importation of products into the United States.

#### § § 327.2

      (a)(1) Whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of meat inspection maintained by any foreign country, with respect to establishments preparing products in such country for export to the United States, insures compliance of such establishments and their products with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and all other provisions of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter which are applied to official establishments in the United States, and their products, and that reliance can be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country, notice of that fact will be given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, products prepared in such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, shall be eligible so far as this subchapter is concerned for importation into the United States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this subchapter have been met.

      (2) The determination of acceptability of a foreign meat inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following requirements and procedures:

      (i) The system shall have a program organized and administered by the national government of the foreign country. The system as implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States with respect to:

      (A) Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments throughout the system at which products are prepared for export to the United States;

      (B) Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;

      (C) The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;

      (D) Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing meat inspection and to certify or refuse to certify products intended for export;

      (E) Adequate administrative and technical support;

      (F) The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.

      (G) Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by the regulations in this subchapter.

      (ii) The legal authority for the system and the regulations thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the system of meat inspection organized and maintained in the United States with respect to:

      (A) Ante-mortem inspection of animals for slaughter and inspection of methods of slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughtering which shall be performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of the veterinarians;

      (B) Post-mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;

      (C) Official controls by the national government over establishment construction, facilities, and equipment;

      (D) Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering and preparation of product, by the assignment of inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to assure that adulterated or misbranded product is not prepared for export to the United States;

      (E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;

      (F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of product;

      (G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;

      (H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.

      (I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or regulations in this subchapter.

      (iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of product into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign meat inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign meat inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system, including information required by paragraph (e) of section 20 of the Act, as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section of the regulations.

      (iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:

      (A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;

      (B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in (A) through (H) of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of that representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign meat inspection official:  That such reports are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States; and

      (C) Random sampling of internal organs and fat of carcasses at the point of slaughter and the testing of such organs and fat, for such residues having been identified by the exporting country's meat inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator:  That such testing is required only on samples taken from carcasses from which meat or meat food products intended for importation into the United States are produced.

      (3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.

      (i) For a new establishment, or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operations conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).

      (ii) If the establishment information provided on the preceding year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, and the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).

      (4) Meat and meat food products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are not eligible for importation into the United States, except as provided by § 327.16 or § 327.17. Eligibility of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn whenever the Administrator determines that the system of meat inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure compliance with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and other requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter as applied to official establishments in the United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country; or that, for lack of current information concerning the system of meat inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign country should be required to reestablish its eligibility.

      (b) A list of countries eligible to export specific process categories of meat and meat food products is maintained at  Meat and meat food products from listed countries must be accompanied by foreign inspection certificates of the country of origin, as required by § 327.4, and are eligible under the regulations in this subchapter for entry into the United States after inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this part. Fresh, chilled, or frozen or other product from countries in which rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever exist, as provided in part 94 of this title, are ineligible for importation into the United States.

If the inspector determines, on the basis of the sample examination, that the product does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the consignment shall be refused entry. However, a consignment rejected for container defects but otherwise acceptable may be reoffered for inspection under the following conditions:

      (1) If the defective containers are not indicative of an unsafe and unstable product as determined by the Administrator;

      (2) If the number and kinds of container defects found in the original sample do not exceed the limits specified for this purpose in FSIS guidelines; and

      (3) If the defective containers in the consignment have been sorted out and exported or destroyed under the supervision of an inspector.

      (k) Program inspectors or Customs officers at border or seaboard ports shall report the sealing of cars, trucks, or other means of conveyance, and the sealing or identification of containers of foreign product on Form MP-410 to Program area supervisors at points where such product is to be inspected.

      (2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry, ” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or to an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States, without the expressed consent of the Administrator based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product indentified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 327.5.

      (4) Product which has been refused entry solely because of misbranding, in lieu of exportation or destruction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may be brought into compliance with the requirements of this part, under supervision of an authorized representative of the Administrator.

      (5) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.

      (6) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Department will take such action as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expense in the appropriate legal forum.

      (7) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 402 of the Act and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 403 of the Act.

      (b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under § 327.7 and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any respect not to comply with the requirements in this part.

      (c) All charges for storage, cartage, and labor with respect to any product which was imported contrary to the Act shall be paid by the owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall constitute a lien against such product and any other product thereafter imported by or for such owner or consignee.

      § 327.22   [Reserved]

#### § § 327.22

      § 327.23   Compliance procedure for cured pork products offered for entry.

#### § § 327.23

      (a)  For the purposes of this section:

      (1) A  is that cured pork article which is contained within one Group as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and which purports to meet the criteria for a single product designated under the heading “_Product_ Name and Qualifying Statements” in the chart in § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter.

      (2) A  or a  means one of the following:

      (i) Group I, consisting of cured pork products which have been cooked while imperviously encased. Any product that fits into the Group shall be placed in this Group regardless of any other considerations.

      (ii) Group II, consisting of cured pork products which have been water cooked. Any product that does not fit into Group I but does fit into Group II shall be placed into Group II regardless of any other considerations.

      (iii) Group III, consisting of boneless, smokehouse heated cured pork products. Any boneless product that does not fit into Group I or II shall be placed in Group III.

      (iv) Group IV, consisting of bone-in or semi-boneless smokehouse heated cured pork products. Any product that is not completely boneless or still contains all the bone which is traditional for bone-in product and does not fit into Group I, II, or III shall be placed in this Group.

      (3)  of a product means the meat protein (indigenous to the raw, unprocessed pork cut) content expressed as a percent of the non-fat portion of the finished product.

      (4) A  is the PFF of the sample minus the minimum PFF requirement, set forth in § 319.104 and § 319.105 of this subchapter, for the product being analyzed, divided by the Appropriate Standard Deviation for the product group.

      (5) The  is that no laboratory result of an individual sample for PFF content be below the applicable minimum requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter by 2.3 or more percentage points for a Group I or II product or 2.7 or more percentage points for a Group III or IV product.

      (6) A  is the arithmetic average of PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or 100 consecutively sampled lots of product entering the United States from a given producing country.

      (7) A  is an estimate of the average of the PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or 100 consecutively sampled lots, adjusted for the size of the lot, of different types of cured pork product entering the United States from a given producing country. A Standardized Weighted Average is computed by multiplying the PFF Standardized Difference calculated for each lot by the number of pounds of product in each lot, adding those results together, and dividing the sum by the total weight of product from all the lots making up the average.

      (8) The  is based on within lot variability. That assigned to Groups I and II = 0.75 percent PFF and that assigned to Groups III and IV = 0.91 percent PFF.

      (9) A  is all product of one type from one establishment presented by an importer as the unit for inspection at the Port of Entry.

      (b)  Except for product imported from Canada, the Department shall collect sample(s) of cured pork product on a random basis from lots offered for entry at the Port of Entry and, after analyzing the sample for fat and indigenous protein content, calculate the PFF percentage. The product shall not be held pending laboratory results during the monitoring phase. The PFF percentage for each sample shall be considered along with the cumulative results of prior samples to assess the effectiveness of a country's overall compliance program and to determine the course of action for subsequent lots of product.

      (1) Factors determining whether a country's inspection system is functioning adequately:

      (i) The PFF percentage for each sample must not be below the minimum PFF requirement by 2.3 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups I and II or 2.7 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups III and IV.

      (ii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be equal to or greater than zero. The count for the 100 consecutive lots starts with the lots arriving from that country after April 15, 1985.

      (iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 36 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be above the lowest 5 percent of the Normal distribution. This minimum value is minus 0.28 (−0.28) for the Arithmetic Average and depends on the production volume for the Weighted Average.

      (2) Actions when calculations indicate that processing procedures in a country are out-of-compliance:

      (i) If the PFF level of a sample taken during normal monitoring procedures is found to be as low as the Absolute Minimum PFF Requirement, the country of origin shall be notified; the lot involved shall be retained if still available in an official establishment or subject to detention or other actions pursuant to the Act; and all subsequently presented lots of that cured pork product from the same foreign establishment shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied.

      (ii) If either of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic or Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots falls below zero or either of the PFF Standardized Averages for the last 36 consecutive lots falls below the upper 95 percent of the Normal distribution, all available cured pork product from the foreign country shall be subject to administrative retention and all subsequently presented lots of cured pork product from the foreign country shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied. The country of origin shall be notified, and shall be subject to other actions pursuant to the Act.

      (c)  When lots of cured pork product are under retention they shall be refused entry and reexported in accordance with § 327.13 of this subchapter unless they can be released in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1), establishments may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), and countries may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(3).

      (1) If a lot is subject to retention procedures under this section, the Department shall collect five randomly selected sample units from each lot and determine the PFF of each sample unit. The lot may be released into commerce if:

      (i) The average PFF percentage of the five randomly selected sample units is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage required by § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter, or

      (ii) The product is relabeled under the supervision of a program employee so that it conforms to the provisions of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter.

      (2) If product from a foreign establishment is subject to retention procedures under this section, the foreign establishment may be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:

      (i) Ten consecutively presented lots of that cured pork product from that establishment have been sampled as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and

      (ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (50 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage.

      (3) If a country is subject to retention procedures under this section, the country shall be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:

      (i) Twenty-five consecutively presented lots of cured pork product have been sampled as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and

      (ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (125 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage; and

      (iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 36 consecutive lots are in the required percentage of the Normal distribution; and

      (iv) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 100 consecutive lots are zero or higher.

      (4) The sample units collected under retention procedures as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will not be included in the PFF standardized averages for 36 and 100 consecutive lots.

      (d)  Products not meeting specified PFF requirements, determined according to procedures set forth in this section, may be deemed adulterated under section 1(m)(8) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(8)) and misbranded under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)).

      (e) Activities requiring additional inspectional supervision, such as relabeling, shall be at the importer's expense. In addition, if the importer wishes, he or she may have samples analyzed at an accredited laboratory.

#### § § 327.25

      (a) Carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products (other than rendered animal fats) that have been treated in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be considered denatured for the purposes of the regulations in this part, except as otherwise provided in part 314 of this subchapter for articles condemned at official establishments or at official import inspection establishments.

      (1) The following agents are prescribed for denaturing carcasses, parts thereof, meat or meat food products which are affected with any condition that would result in their condemnation and disposal under part 314 of this subchapter if they were at an official establishment or at an official import inspection establishment: Crude carbolic acid; cresylic disinfectant; a formula consisting of 1 part FD&C green No. 3 coloring, 40 parts water, 40 parts liquid detergent, and 40 parts oil of citronella, or other proprietary substance approved by the Administrator in specific cases.

      (2) Meat may be denatured by dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent tannic acid, followed by immersion in a water bath, then dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent ferric acid; and except as provided in paragraphs (a) (3) and (5) of this section, the following agents are prescribed for denaturing other carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products, for which denaturing is required by this part: FD&C green No. 3 coloring; FD&C blue No. 1 coloring; FD&C blue No. 2 coloring; finely powdered charcoal; or other proprietary substance approved by the Administrator in specific cases.   Carcasses (other than viscera), parts thereof, cuts of meat, and unground pieces of meat darkened by charcoal or other black dyes shall be deemed to be denatured pursuant to this section only if they contain at least that degree of darkness depicted by diagram 1 of the Meat Denaturing Guide (MP Form 91).

      (3) Tripe may be denatured by dipping it in a 6 percent solution of tannic acid for 1 minute followed by immersion in a water bath, then immersing it for 1 minute in a solution of 0.022 percent FD&C yellow No. 5 coloring.

      (4) When meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products are in ground form, 4 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard done, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 5 mesh in the standards issued by the U.S. Bureau of Standards or 6 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 8 mesh in said Standards, uniformly incorporated with the product, may be used in lieu of the agents prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (5) Before the denaturing agents are applied to articles in pieces more than 4 inches in diameter, the pieces shall be freely slashed or sectioned. (If the articles are in pieces not more than 4 inches in diameter, slashing or sectioning will not be necessary.) The application of any of the denaturing agents listed in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section to the outer surface of molds or blocks or boneless meat, meat by-products, or meat food products shall not be adequate. The denaturing agent must be mixed intimately with all the material to be denatured, and must be applied in such quantity and manner that it cannot easily and readily be removed by washing or soaking. A sufficient amount of the appropriate agent shall be used to give the material a distinctive color, odor, or taste so that such material cannot be confused with an article of human food.

      (b) Inedible rendered animal fats shall be denatured by thoroughly mixing therein denaturing oil, No. 2 fuel oil, brucine dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and pine oil or oil of rosemary, finely powdered charcoal, or any proprietary denaturing agent approved for the purpose by the Administrator in specific cases. The charcoal shall be used in no less quantity than 100 parts per million and shall be of such character that it will remain suspended indefinitely in the liquid fat. Sufficient of the chosen identifying agents shall be used to give the rendered fat so distinctive a color, odor, or taste that it cannot be confused with an article of human food.

      § 331.1   Definition of “State”.

#### § § 331.1

      For purposes of this part, the term “State” means any State (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) or organized Territory.

      § 331.2   Designation of States under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.

#### § § 331.2

      Each of the following States has been designated, under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, as a State in which the provisions of Titles I and IV of the Act shall apply to operations and transactions wholly within such State. The Federal provisions apply, effective on the dates shown below:

> [35 FR 19667, Dec. 29, 1970]

      § 331.3   States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act; application of regulations.

#### § § 331.3

      The provisions of the regulations in this subchapter apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 331.2 under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)

      (a) Each establishment located in such a designated State shall be granted inspection required under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.

      (b) Section 305.2 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter, except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of this subchapter. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations in this subchapter.

      (c) Sections 416.2(c), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this chapter shall apply to such establishments.

      (d) Section 314.2 of this subchapter shall apply to such establishments, except that a separate room or compartment need not be provided for inedible products if they can be handled so that they do not create insanitary conditions in any room or compartment used for edible products or otherwise render any edible products adulterated and do not interfere with the conduct of inspection. For example, intestines, paunch contents, feet, and hides might be accumulated on the kill floor in clean, watertight drums with close fitting covers if there is sufficient space to store them out of the way until the close of the day's operation.

      (e) Sections 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter apply to such establishments, except as provided in this paragraph (e).

      (1) The operator of each such establishment will, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use, (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor of the circuit in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 1(n) of the Act.

      (2) The circuit supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the Washington, DC, office of the Labeling and Packaging Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.

      (3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, or their use must be discontinued.

      (4) The circuit supervisor will also review all shipping containers to insure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of self-destructive pressure sensitive tape or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of this subchapter must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.

      (f) Sections 320.1, 320.2, 320.3, 320.4, 320.5, 325.20, and 325.21 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 301(c) only if the State is also designated under section 205 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 331.6.

      (g) Section 321.1(a) of this subchapter will not apply to States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.

      (h) Parts 322 and 327 and § 325.3 of this subchapter relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.

      (i) Part 325 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter and to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section.

      (j) Sections 325.4, 325.15, and 325.1(b) of this subchapter will not apply to require a certificate, or evidence thereof, for the distribution solely within any designated State of products that are U.S. inspected and passed and so marked.

      § 331.4   Control and disposal of non-federally-inspected products in States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.

#### § § 331.4

      Upon the effective date of designation of a State under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, no products can be prepared within the State unless they are prepared under inspection pursuant to the regulations in this subchapter or are exempted from the requirement of inspection under § 303.1 of this subchapter, and no unexempted products which were prepared without any inspection can lawfully be distributed within the State. For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such designation, products which were prepared and inspected and passed under the supervision of a responsible State or local inspection agency can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection legend is not required. Within the 90-day period, products that have been inspected by the State or local inspection agency may be further prepared and otherwise handled in official establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter or at establishments exempted from the requirements of such inspection under § 303.1 of this subchapter, and may be distributed as provided in this section but otherwise shall be handled in accordance with § 305.4 of this subchapter. Such products shall not bear any [Federal] official inspection legends. After said 90-day period, only federally inspected and passed products may be distributed within the designated State, except as provided in § 303.1 of this subchapter.

      § 331.5   Criteria and procedure for designating establishments with operations which would clearly endanger the public health; disposition of products; application of regulations.

#### § § 331.5

      (a) An establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:

      (1) Any meat or meat food product prepared at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:

      (i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of sections 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or

      (ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, or unwholesome or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from meat or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics; or it is, or was prepared from, a carcass affected with a disease transmissible to humans and its condemnation would be required under part 309 or 310 of the Federal Meat Inspection regulations (9 CFR parts 309, 310) at federally inspected establishments; or

      (iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishments, or insanitary water is used in preparing meat or meat food products for human food); or

      (iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of an animal that died otherwise than by slaughter; or

      (v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and

      (2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.

      (b) When any such establishment is identified by a Program Inspector as one producing adulterated product, which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:

      (1) The Program Inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Program. When it is determined by the Regional Director that any establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.

      (2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him ten days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of titles I and IV of the Act as though engaged in commerce.

      (3) Thereafter the Program Inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.

      (c) Products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to detention, seizure and condemnation in accordance with part 329 of this subchapter:  That products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.

      (d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 303.1 of this subchapter. All of the provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section, except that the exceptions provided for in § 331.3 of this part shall apply to such establishments.

      (b) To request an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part, a State must submit a written request to the Administrator through the FSIS District Office for the FSIS District in which the State is located. In the request the State must:

      (1) Identify establishments in the State that have requested to be selected for the program that the State recommends for initial selection into the program, if any;

      (2) Demonstrate that the State is able to provide the necessary inspection services to selected establishments in the State and conduct any related activities that would be required under a cooperative interstate shipment program established under this part; and

      (3) Agree that, if the State enters into an agreement with FSIS for a cooperative interstate shipment program, the State will:

      (iii) When necessary, cooperate with FSIS to transition selected establishments in the State that have been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program to become official establishments.

      (c) If the Administrator determines that a State that has submitted a request to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program qualifies to enter into a cooperative agreement for such a program, the Administrator and the State will sign a cooperative agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions under which each party will cooperate to provide inspection services to selected establishments located in the State.

      (d) After the Administrator and a State have signed an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will:

      (1) Appoint an FSIS employee as the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State and

      (2) Coordinate with the State to select establishments to participate in the program as provided in § 332.5(b) of this part.

The frequency with which the SEC will visit selected establishments under the SEC's jurisdiction will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the operations conducted at the selected establishment, the establishment's schedule of operations, and the establishment's performance under the cooperative interstate shipment program. If necessary, the selected establishment coordinator, in consultation with the District Manager that covers the State, may designate qualified FSIS personnel to visit a selected establishment on behalf of the selected establishment coordinator.

      (b) The selected establishment coordinator, in coordination with the State, will verify that selected establishments in the State are receiving the necessary inspection services from designated personnel, and that these establishments are eligible, and remain eligible, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program. The selected establishment coordinator's verification activities may include:

      (1) Verifying that each selected establishment employs, and continues to employ, 25 or fewer employees, on average, as required under § 332.3(a) of this part, unless the establishment is transitioning to become an official establishment;

      (2) Verifying that the designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter;

      (3) Verifying that that the State staffing levels for each selected establishments are appropriate to carry out the required inspection activities; and

      (4) Assessing each selected establishment's compliance with the Act and implementing regulations under this chapter.

      (c) If the selected establishment coordinator determines that designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in the State in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for the State to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address inspection deficiencies identified by the selected establishment coordinator. If the State fails to develop a corrective action plan, or the selected establishment coordinator for the State determines that the corrective action plan is inadequate, the Administrator will terminate the agreement for the cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 321.3(d) of this chapter.

      § 332.8   Quarterly reports.

#### § § 332.8

      (a) The selected establishment coordinator will prepare a report on a quarterly basis that describes the status of each selected establishment under his or her jurisdiction.

      (b) The quarterly report required in paragraph (a) of this section will:

Such petition shall state specifically the errors alleged to have been made by the Administrator in denying the benefits of the Act pending investigation and hearing. Within 20 days following the receipt of such petition for reconsideration, the Administrator shall reinstate the benefits of the Act or notify the petitioner of the reasons for continued interim denial.

        (c)  Any trade label to be affixed to a container of any edible products for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language. However, the inspection mark shall appear on the label in English, but, in addition, may be literally translated into such foreign language.

        (d)  (1) Labels approved for use pursuant to §§ 354.60 to 354.64 shall be used only for the purpose for which approved and shall not otherwise be disposed of from the plant for which approved except with written approval of the Administrator. Any unauthorized use or disposition of approved labels or labels bearing official identification may result in cancellation of the approval and denial of the use of labels bearing official identification or denial of the benefits of the Act pursuant to the provisions of § 354.60.

        (2) The use of simulations or imitations of any official identification by any person is prohibited.

#### § § 354.122

        Rabbits found in a dying condition on premises of an official plant shall be immediately destroyed and, together with any rabbits found dead on such premises, shall be disposed of in accordance with § 354.132. Rabbits plainly showing, on ante-mortem inspection, any disease or condition, that under §§ 354.129 to 354.131, inclusive, would cause condemnation of their carcasses on post-mortem inspection, shall be condemned. Rabbits which, on ante-mortem inspection, are condemned shall not be dressed, nor shall they be conveyed into any department of the plant where rabbit products are prepared or held. Rabbits which have been condemned on ante-mortem inspection and have been killed shall, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service, receive treatment as provided in § 354.132.

        All rabbits which, on ante-mortem inspection, do not plainly show, but are suspected of being affected with any disease or condition that under §§ 354.129 to 354.131, inclusive, may cause condemnation in whole or in part on post-mortem inspection, shall be segregated from the other rabbits and held for separate slaughter, evisceration, and post-mortem inspection. The inspector shall be notified when such segregated lots are presented for post-mortem inspection and inspection of such rabbits shall be conducted separately. Such procedure for the correlation of ante-mortem and post-mortem findings by the inspector, as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, shall be carried out.

        § 354.124   Quarantine of diseased rabbits.

#### § § 354.124

        If live rabbits, which are affected by any contagious disease which is transmissible to man, are brought into an official establishment, such rabbits shall be segregated. The slaughtering of such rabbits shall be deferred and they shall be dealt with in one of the following ways:

        (a) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, the lot shall be subject to ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection pursuant to the regulations in this part.

        (b) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, such rabbits may be released for treatment under the control of an appropriate State or Federal agency. If the circumstances are such that release for treatment is impracticable, a careful rabbit-by-rabbit ante-mortem inspection shall be made, and all rabbits found to be, or which are suspected of being, affected with the contagious disease transmissible to man shall be condemned.

        § 354.126   Carcasses held for further examination.

#### § § 354.126

        Each carcass, including all parts thereof, in which there is any lesion of disease or other condition, which might render such carcass or any part thereof unfit for human food, and with respect to which a final decision cannot be made on first examination by the inspector, shall be held for further examination. The identity of each such carcass, including all parts thereof, shall be maintained until a final examination has been completed.

        § 354.127   Condemnation and treatment of carcasses.

#### § § 354.127

        Each carcass, or any part thereof, which is found to be unsound, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food shall be condemned by the inspector and shall receive such treatment, under the supervision of the inspector, as will prevent its use for human food and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals.

        § 354.128   Certification of carcasses.

#### § § 354.128

        Each carcass and all parts and organs thereof which are found by the inspector to be sound, wholesome, and fit for human food shall be certified as provided in this part.

#### § § 354.129

        The carcasses or parts of carcasses of all rabbits inspected at an official establishment and found at the time of post-mortem inspection, or at any subsequent inspection, to be affected with any of the diseases or conditions named in other sections in this part, shall be disposed of in accordance with the section pertaining to the disease or condition. Owing to the fact that it is impracticable to formulate rules for each specific disease or condition and to designate at just what stage a disease process results in an unwholesome product, the decision as to the disposal of all carcasses, parts, or organs not specifically covered by the regulations, or by instructions of the Administrator issued pursuant thereto, shall be left to the inspector in charge, and if the inspector in charge is in doubt concerning the disposition to be made, specimens from such carcasses shall be forwarded to the laboratory for diagnosis.

        § 354.130   Diseases or conditions evident which require condemnation.

#### § § 354.130

        (a) Carcasses of rabbits affected with or showing lesions of any of the following named diseases or conditions shall be condemned: Tularemia, anthrax, hemorrhagic septicemia, pyemia, septicemia, leukemia, acute enteritis, peritonitis, sarcomatosis, metritis, necrobacillosis (Smorl's Disease), tuberculosis, emaciation, streptobacillary pseudotuberculosis, and advanced stages of snuffles. Rabbits from pathological laboratories shall be condemned.

        (b) Any organ or part of a rabbit carcass affected with a tumor shall be condemned and when there is evidence that the general condition of the rabbit has been affected by the size, position, or nature of the tumor, the whole carcass shall be condemned. In cases of malignant neoplasms involving any internal organ to a marked extent, or affecting the muscles, skeleton, or body lymph glands, even primarily, the whole carcass shall be condemned.

        (c) Carcasses of rabbits showing any disease such as generalized melanosis, pseudoleukemia, and the like, which systemically affect the rabbit, shall be condemned.

        (d) Any organ or part of a carcass which is badly bruised or which is affected by an abscess, or a suppurating sore, shall be condemned. Parts or carcasses which are contaminated by pus shall be condemned.

        (e) Carcasses of rabbits contaminated by volatile oils, paints, poisons, gases, or other substances which affect the wholesomeness of the carcass shall be condemned.

        (f) All carcasses of rabbits so infected that consumption of the meat or meat food products thereof may give rise to meat poisoning shall be condemned. This includes all carcasses showing signs of any of the following diseases: Acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges; septicemia or pyemia, whether traumatic, or without evident cause; gangrenous or severe hemorrhagic enteritis or gastritis; polyarthritis and acute nephritis. Immediately after the slaughter of any rabbit so infected, the infected premises and implements used shall be thoroughly sanitized. The part or parts of any carcass coming into contact with the carcass or any part of the carcass of any rabbit covered by this section other than those affected with acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges, shall be condemned.

        (g) Carcasses showing any degree of icterus with a parenchymatous degeneration of organs, the result of infection or intoxication, and those which, as a result of a pathological condition, show an intense yellow or greenish-yellow discoloration without evidence of infection or intoxication shall be condemned.

        (h) Carcasses of rabbits affected with mange or scab in advanced stages, or showing emaciation or extension of the inflammation to the flesh, shall be condemned. When the diseased condition is slight, the carcass may be passed for food after removal and condemnation of the affected parts.

        (i) In the disposal of carcasses and parts of carcasses showing evidence of infestation with parasites not transmissible to man, the following general rules shall govern: If the lesions are localized in such manner and are of such character that the parasites and the lesions caused by them may be radically removed, the non-affected portion of the carcass, or part of the carcass, may be certified for food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions. Where a part of a carcass shows numerous lesions caused by parasites, or the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasites and lesions is difficult and uncertainly accomplished, or if the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the organ or part in any way unfit for food, the affected organ or part shall be condemned.

#### § § 354.244

        Temperatures and procedures which are necessary for cooling and freezing of rabbits in accordance with sound commercial practice shall be maintained in the coolers and freezers, and chilling temperatures and procedures shall also be in accordance with sound commercial practice.

        (a)  Immediately after evisceration and washing of the carcass, it shall be placed in a cooling tank containing running cold tap water to remove the animal heat from the carcass. Carcasses shall not be allowed to remain in the cooling tank for longer than 1 hour.

        (b)  Immediately after the initial water chilling, the carcasses shall be placed in cooling racks and thereupon placed in a refrigerated cooler with moderate air movements and a temperature which will reduce the internal temperature of the carcasses to from 36 °F. to 40 °F., both inclusive, within 24 hours.

        (c)  (1) When ready-to-cook rabbits are packaged in bulk or shipping containers, the carcasses should be individually wrapped or packaged in water-vapor resistant cartons or the containers should be lined with heavy water-vapor resistant paper so as to assure adequate overlapping of the lining to completely surround the carcasses and to permit unsealed closure or sealing in such a manner that water-vapor loss from the product is considerably retarded or prevented. The rabbit carcasses should receive an initial rapid freezing under such packaging, temperature, air circulation, and stacking conditions which will result in freezing the carcasses solid in less than 48 hours.

        (2) Frozen ready-to-cook rabbits shall be held under conditions which will maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with temperature maintained as constant as possible.

        (d)  Immediately after packaging, all ready-to-cook rabbits, other than those which are shipped from the plant in a refrigerated carrier, should be moved into the freezer, except that a period not exceeding 72 hours will be permitted for transportation and temporary holding before placing in the freezer provided such rabbits are held at not above 36 °F.

      Subpart B—Administration; Application of Inspection and Other Requirements

        § 381.3   Administration.

#### § § 381.3

        (a) [Reserved]

        (b) The Administrator may in specific classes of cases waive for limited periods any provisions of the regulations in order to permit appropriate and necessary action in the event of a public health emergency or to permit experimentation so that new procedures, equipment, and processing techniques may be tested to facilitate definite improvements:  That such waivers of the provisions of the regulations are not in conflict with the purposes or provisions of the Act.

        (c) Pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator believes that, in establishments processing poultry products at which inspection under the Act and regulations is required, the frequency with which and the manner in which poultry products made from poultry previously slaughtered and eviscerated in official establishments are reinspected by Inspection Service employees should be based on considerations relevant to effective regulation of poultry products and protection of the health and welfare of consumers. In order to test procedures for use in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining whether and, if so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage exceeds that which should be deemed necessary pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the manner of inspection by Inspection Service employees shall be determined on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in accordance with this section.

        (d) The determinations referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be made by the Inspection Service and shall reflect evaluations of the performance and the characteristics of such establishments.

        (1) In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:

        (i) The history of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the person operating such establishment or by anyone responsibly connected with the business operating such establishment, as “responsibly connected” is defined in section 18(a) of the Act,

        (ii) The competence of the person operating such establishment, as indicated by:

        (A) Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable regulatory requirements,

        (B) Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and consistent manner, and

        (C) Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Inspection Service employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and

        (iii) The procedures used in such establishment to control the production process, environment, and resulting product in order to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

        (2) In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:

        (i) The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such establishment,

        (ii) The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at such establishment,

        (iii) The volume of product resulting from each such operation at such establishment,

        (iv) Whether and to what extent slaughter and evisceration operations also are conducted at such establishment,

        (v) What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the Federal Meat Inspection Act also are processed at such establishment, and

        (vi) The size of such establishment.

        (e)(1) For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (c) of this section, the frequency of inspection by Inspection Service employees of operations other than slaughter and evisceration may be reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of such establishment described in paragraph (d)(1) indicates that there are:

        (i) No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10 years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and frequency of any such noncompliance), and

        (ii) The competence and control procedures needed to assure and monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

        (2)(i) The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:

        (A) The evaluation of the characteristics of such establishment described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,

        (B) The significance of potential public health consequences of noncompliance, and

        (C) The availability of Inspection Service employees.

        (ii) To the extent that frequency of inspection or other conditions and methods of inspection coverage are identified as conflicting with provisions of the regulations in this part, the Administrator will waive such provisions for the period of experimentation, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        () Only federally inspected and passed, or exempted (or, as provided in § 381._2_23, State or local agency inspected and passed or exempted) poultry products are handled or used in the preparation of any poultry products;

        () No sale of poultry products is made in excess of a normal retail quantity as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and

That the exempted facility may be subject to inspection requirements under the Act for as long as the Administrator deems necessary if the Administrator determines that the sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the processing procedures or methods at the facility are such that any of its poultry products are rendered adulterated. When the Administrator has made such determination and subjected a restaurant central kitchen facility to such inspection requirements, the operator of such facility shall be afforded an opportunity to dispute the Administrator's determination in a hearing pursuant to rules of practice which will be adopted for this proceeding.

        (v) A similar retail-type establishment is any establishment which is a combination retail store and restaurant; any delicatessen which meets the requirements for a retail store or restaurant as prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section; or other establishment as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

        (vi) A consumer is any household consumer, hotel, or restaurant, or similar institution as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

        (3) Whenever any complaint is received by the Administrator from any person alleging that any retail establishment or restaurant claiming exemption under this paragraph (d) in any designated State or organized territory listed in § 381.221 that is also identified in § 381.224 as a jurisdiction that does not have or is not exercising adequate authority with respect to recordkeeping requirements, has been operated in violation of the conditions prescribed in this paragraph (d) for such exemption, and the Administrator, upon investigation of the complaint, has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred, he shall so notify the operator of the retail establishment or restaurant and afford him reasonable opportunity to present his views informally with respect to the matter. Thereafter, if the Administrator determines that such a violation has occurred, and that a requirement that the operator keep records concerning the operations of the retail establishment or restaurant would effectuate the purposes of the Act, the Administrator shall order the operator to maintain complete, accurate, and legible records of his total monthly purchases and of his total monthly sales of poultry and poultry products. Such records shall separately show total sales to household consumers and total sales to other consumers, and shall be maintained for the period prescribed in § 381.177.

In those instances where there is conflict of any material fact, the owner or operator of the establishment, upon request, shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the disputed fact, in accordance with rules of practice which shall be adopted for the proceeding. However, such withdrawal or modification shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines that an imminent threat to food safety or public health exists, and that such action is, therefore, necessary to protect the public health, interest or safety. Such withdrawal or modification shall be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the owner or operator of the particular establishment as promptly as circumstances permit. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation shall be given to the owner or operator of the establishment as promptly as circumstances permit. This withdrawal or modification shall continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding and any judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.

        (6) The adulteration and misbranding provisions of the Act and the regulations apply to articles which are exempted from inspection under § 381.10(e).

        § 381.11   Exemptions based on religious dietary laws.

#### § § 381.11

        (a) Any person who slaughters, processes, or otherwise handles poultry or poultry products which have been or are to be processed as required by recognized religious dietary laws may apply for exemption from specific provisions of the Act or regulations which are in conflict with such religious dietary laws. Any person desiring such an exemption shall apply in writing to the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, setting forth the specific provisions of the Act and the regulations from which exemption is sought and setting forth the provisions of the religious dietary laws in support of the requested exemption. In addition, the applicant for such an exemption shall submit a statement from the clerical official having jurisdiction over the enforcement of the religious dietary laws with respect to the poultry or poultry products involved, which identifies the requirements of such laws pertaining to the slaughter of the poultry and the processing or other handling of the poultry products involved, and certifies that such requirements are in conflict with specific provisions of the Act and regulations from which the exemption is sought.

        (b) The Administrator, upon a determination that an exemption should be granted, will grant such exemption to the extent necessary to avoid conflict with the religious requirements while still effectuating the purposes of the Act. He may impose such conditions as to sanitary standards, practices, and procedures in granting such exemption as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Any person who processes poultry or poultry products under exemption from certain requirements as provided in this section shall be subject to all of the other applicable provisions of the Act and the regulations. Processing plants shall meet the sanitary requirements set forth in this part and unless exempted from inspection under the provisions of this subpart, shall be required to qualify for inspection and operate as official establishments. Slaughtered poultry which is prepared under an exemption authorizing the sale of noneviscerated poultry in commerce shall be individually identified with a label approved by the Administrator which identifies the clerical official under whose supervision the poultry was slaughtered.

        § 381.12   Effect of religious dietary laws exemptions on other persons.

#### § § 381.12

        Whenever a slaughterer or processor is granted an exemption under § 381.11 with respect to the slaughtering or processing of any poultry or poultry products under this part, under specified conditions, the sale, offer for sale, transportation and other handling in commerce by any person of such poultry and poultry products in accordance with such conditions is hereby authorized, except as restricted by the Act.

        § 381.13   Suspension or termination of exemptions.

#### § § 381.13

        (a) The Administrator may, by order, in accordance with the applicable rules of practice suspend or terminate any exemption under § 381.10(a) with respect to any person whenever he finds that such action will aid in effectuating the purposes of the Act. Failure to comply with the conditions of the exemption, including, but not limited to, failure to process poultry and poultry products under clean and sanitary conditions may result in termination of an exemption, in addition to any other penalties provided by law.

        (b) Except as provided in § 381.10(c), the Administrator may extend the requirements of the Act to any establishment in any State or organized territory at which poultry products are processed for distribution solely within such jurisdiction if he determines in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph 5(c)(1) of the Act that the establishment is producing adulterated poultry products which would clearly endanger the public health.

        § 381.14   Inspection concerning purportedly exempted operations.

#### § § 381.14

        Inspectors of the Inspection Service are authorized to make inspections in accordance with law to ascertain whether any of the provisions of the Act or the regulations applying to producers, retailers, or other persons purporting to be exempted from any requirements under this subpart have been violated.

        § 381.15   Exemption from definition of “poultry product” of certain human food products containing poultry.

#### § § 381.15

        The following articles contain poultry ingredients only in a relatively small proportion or historically have not been considered by consumers as products of the poultry food industry. Therefore said articles are exempted from the definition of “poultry product” and the requirements of the Act and the regulations applicable to poultry products, if they comply with the conditions specified in this section.

        (a) Any human food product (in a consumer package) not provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, if:

        (1) It contains less than 2 percent cooked poultry meat (deboned white or dark poultry meat, or both) and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173;

        (2) It contains less than 10 percent of cooked poultry skins, giblets, or fat, separately, and less than 10 percent of cooked poultry skins, giblets, fat, and meat (as meat is limited in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173, in any combination;

        (3) The poultry ingredients used in the product were prepared under inspection as defined in § 381.1, or were inspected under a foreign inspection system approved under § 381.196(b) and imported in compliance with the Act and the regulations;

        (4) The immediate container of the product bears a label which shows the name of the product in accordance with this section; and

        (5) The product is not represented as a poultry product. The aforesaid percentages of ingredients shall be computed on the basis of the moist, deboned, cooked poultry in the ready-to-serve product when prepared according to the serving directions on the consumer package.

        (b) Any human food product (in an institutional pack), not provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, if:

        (1) It is prepared for sale only to institutional users, such as hotels, restaurants, and boardinghouses, for use as a soup base or flavoring;

        (2) It contains less than 15 percent cooked poultry meat (deboned white or dark poultry meat or both) and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173, computed on the basis of the moist deboned, cooked poultry meat and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” in such product; and

        (3) It complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section in all respects.

        (c) Bouillon cubes, poultry broths, gravies, sauces, seasonings, and flavorings if:

        (1) They contain poultry meat and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173 or poultry fat only in condimental quantities;

        (2) They comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section in all respects; and

        (3) In the case of poultry broth, it will not be used in the processing of any poultry product in any official establishment.

        (d) Fat capsules and sandwiches containing poultry products if they comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section in all respects.

        (e) Products of the types specified in this section except those specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section will be deemed to be represented as poultry products if the kind name of the poultry (chicken, turkey, etc.) is used in the product name of the product without appropriate qualification. For example, a consumer-packaged noodle soup product containing less than 2 percent chicken meat on a ready-to-serve basis may not be labeled “Chicken Noodle Soup” but, when appropriate, could be labeled as “Chicken Flavored Noodle Soup.” Products exempted under this section are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

#### § § 381.16

        The operator of each establishment of the kind required by § 381.6 to have inspection shall make application to the Administrator for inspection service. In cases of change of name, ownership, or location, a new application shall be made.

        § 381.17   Filing of application.

#### § § 381.17

        Every application for inspection at any establishment shall be made by the operator on a form furnished by the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, and shall include all information called for by that form, including the name of any subsidiary corporation that will prepare any poultry product or conduct any other operation at the establishment for which inspection is requested. The applicant for inspection will be held responsible for compliance by all its subsidiaries with the requirements of the regulations at such establishments if inspection is granted. Processing of poultry products and other operations at the establishment for which inspection is granted may be conducted only by the applicant, except that such a subsidiary of the grantee, may conduct such operations at such establishment.

        § 381.18   Authority of applicant.

#### § § 381.18

        Any person applying for inspection service may be required at the discretion of the Administrator to demonstrate that the operator of the establishment authorized him to do so.

        § 381.20   Survey and grant of inspection.

#### § § 381.20

        (a) Before inspection is granted, FSIS shall survey the establishment to determine if the construction and facilities of the establishment are in accordance with the regulations. FSIS will grant inspection, subject to § 381.21, when these requirements are met.

        (b) FSIS shall give notice in writing to each applicant granted inspection and shall specify in the notice the establishment, including the limits of the establishment's premises, to which the grant pertains.

> [62 FR 45026, Aug. 25, 1997]

        § 381.21   Refusal of inspection.

#### § § 381.21

        (a) Any application for inspection in accordance with this part may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.

        (b)(1) Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters of the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within 1 year after receipt of such request. Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Administrator (as defined in § 381.1) is required by paragraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that paragraph. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of said paragraph (2) have been met.

        (2) However, certification under subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is not initially required in connection with an application for inspection granted after April 3, 1970, for facilities existing or under construction on April 3, 1970, although certification for such facilities is required to be obtained within the 3-year period immediately following April 3, 1970. Failure to obtain such certification or to meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.

        (3) Further, any application for inspection pending on April 3, 1970, and granted within 1 year thereafter shall not require certification for 1 year following the grant of inspection but such grant of inspection shall terminate at the end of 1 year after its issuance unless prior thereto such certification has been obtained and the other requirements of subsection 21(b) are met.

        (4) In the case of any activity which will affect water quality but for which there are no applicable water quality standards, no certification is required prior to the grant of inspection but such grant will be conditioned upon a requirement of compliance with the purpose of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as provided in paragraph 21(b)(9) of said Act.

        (a) No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except under the supervision of an Inspection Service employee. All eviscerating of poultry and further processing shall be done with reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.

        (b) A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration. Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than 30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as 5  hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.

        (c) Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 hours per shift during the basic workweek subject to the provisions of § 381.38:  That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to put on required gear, pick up required forms and walk to a work station; and the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to return from a work station, drop off required forms, and remove required gear; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously handicap the Department in carrying out its functions. These provisions are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as provided in § 381.145(h) of this subchapter.

        (d)(1) Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area supervisor shall take in account the efficient and effective use of inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify the workweek, daily clock hours of operation, and lunch periods for all departments of the establishment requiring inspection.

        (2) Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving changes in the workweek or an addition or elimination of shifts shall be submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved:  Minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may be approved by the inspector in charge if such request is received on the day preceding the day of change.

        (3) Requests for inspection service outside an approved work schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service at the start of the following day:  That an inspector may be recalled to his assignment after the completion of his daily tour of duty under the provisions of § 381.39(b).

        (2) After product has been chilled, the establishment must prevent the outgrowth of pathogens on the product as long as the product remains at the establishment.

        (3) The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for chilling that address, at a minimum, the potential for pathogen outgrowth, the conditions affecting carcass chilling, and when its chilling process is completed. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program.

        (c)  (1) Only ice produced from potable water may be used for ice and water chilling, except that water and ice used for chilling may be reused in accordance with § 416.2(g). The ice must be handled and stored in a sanitary manner.

        (2)(i) Poultry chilling equipment must be operated in a manner consistent with meeting the applicable pathogen reduction performance standards for raw poultry products as set forth in § 381.94 and the provisions of the establishment's HACCP plan.

        (ii) Major portions of poultry carcasses, as defined in § 381.170(b)(22), may be chilled in water and ice.

        (d)  (1) Poultry washing, chilling, and draining practices and procedures must be such as will minimize water absorption and retention at time of packaging.

        (2) The establishment must provide scales, weights, identification devices, and other supplies necessary to conduct water tests.

        (e)  Air chilling is the method of chilling raw poultry carcasses and parts predominately with air. An antimicrobial intervention may be applied with water at the beginning of the chilling process, provided that its use does not result in any net pick-up of water or moisture during the chilling process. The initial antimicrobial intervention may result in some temperature reduction of the product, provided that the majority of temperature removal is accomplished exclusively by chilled air.

        (f)  (1) Ready-to-cook poultry which is to be or is labeled with descriptive terms such as “fresh frozen,” “quick frozen” or “frozen fresh” or any other term implying a rapid change from a fresh state to a frozen state shall be placed into a freezer within 48 hours after initial chilling in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. During this period, if such poultry is not immediately placed into a freezer after chilling and packaging, it shall be held at 36 °F. or lower.

        (2) Ready-to-cook poultry shall be frozen in a manner so as to bring the internal temperature of the birds at the center of the package to 0 °F. or below within 72 hours from the time of entering the freezer. Such procedures shall not apply to raw poultry product described in § 381.129(b)(6)(i) of this subchapter.

        (3) Upon written request, and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator, in specific cases, ready-to-cook poultry which is to be frozen immediately may be moved from the official establishment prior to freezing:  That the plant and freezer are so located and such necessary arrangements are made that the Inspection Service will have access to the freezing room and adequate opportunity to determine compliance with the time and temperature requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

        (4) Warm packaged ready-to-cook poultry which is to be chilled by immediate entry into a freezer within the official establishment shall within 2 hours from time of slaughter be placed in a plate freezer or a freezer with a functioning circulating air system where a temperature of −10 °F. or lower is maintained.

        (5) Frozen poultry shall be held under conditions which will maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with temperature maintained as constant as possible under good commercial practice.

        § 381.67   Young chicken and squab slaughter inspection rate maximums under traditional inspection procedure.

#### § § 381.67

        The maximum number of birds to be inspected by each inspector per minute under the traditional inspection procedure for the different young chicken and squab slaughter line configurations are specified in the following table. These maximum rates will not be exceeded. The inspector in charge will be responsible for reducing production line rates where in the inspector's judgment the prescribed inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed within the time available, either because the birds are not presented by the official establishment in such a manner that the carcasses, including both internal and external surfaces and all organs, are readily accessible for inspection, or because the health conditions of a particular flock dictate a need for a more extended inspection procedure. The standards in 381.170(a) of this part specify which classes of birds constitute young chickens and squabs. Section 381.76(b) specifies when either the traditional inspection procedure or the modified traditional inspection procedure can or must be used.

        § 381.68   Maximum inspection rates—New turkey inspection system.

#### § § 381.68

        (a) The maximum inspection rates for one inspector New Turkey Inspection (NTI-1 and NTI-1 Modified) and two inspectors New Turkey Inspection (NTI-2 and NTI-2 Modified) are listed in the table below. The line speeds for NTI-1 and NTI-2 are for lines using standard 9-inch shackles on 12-inch centers with birds hung on every shackle and opened with J-type or Bar-type opening cuts. The line speeds for NTI-1 Modified and NTI-2 Modified are for Bar-type cut turkey lines using a shackle with a 4-inch by 4-inch selector (or kickout), a 45 degree bend of the lower 2 inches, an extended central loop portion of the shackle that lowers the abdominal cavity opening of the carcasses to an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical in direct alignment with the inspector's view, and a width of 10.5 inches. Maximum rates for those establishments having varying configurations will be established by the Administrator but will not exceed those in the table. Neither the rates in the table nor those established for establishments with varying configurations shall be exceeded under any circumstances.

        (b) There are two categories of turkeys for determining inspection rates, “light turkeys” and “heavy turkeys”. Light turkeys are all turkeys weighing less than 16 pounds. Heavy turkeys are all turkeys weighing 16 pounds or more. The weights refer to the bird at the point of post-mortem inspection, with blood, feathers and feet removed.

        (c) The inspector in charge may reduce inspection line rates when in his/her judgment the prescribed inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed within the time available because the health conditions of a particular flock or other factors, including the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection and the level of contamination among the birds on the line, dictate a need for a more extended inspection.

        (a) The maximum line speed for young chicken slaughter establishments that operate under the New Poultry Inspection System is 140 birds per minute.

        (b) The maximum line speed for turkey slaughter establishments that operate under the New Poultry Inspection System is 55 birds per minute.

        (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, establishments that operate under the New Poultry Inspection System must reduce their line speed as directed by inspectors-in-charge. Inspectors-in-charge are authorized to direct establishments to operate at a reduced line speed when in their judgment a carcass-by-carcass inspection cannot be adequately performed within the time available due to the manner in which the birds are presented to the online carcass inspector, the health conditions of a particular flock, or factors that may indicate a loss of process control.

        § 381.70   Ante mortem inspection; when required; extent.

#### § § 381.70

        (a) An ante mortem inspection of poultry shall, where and to the extent considered necessary by the Administrator and under such instructions as he may issue from time to time, be made of poultry on the day of slaughter in any official establishment.

        (b) The examination and inspection of ratites will be on the day of slaughter, except:

        (1) When it is necessary for humane reasons to slaughter an injured animal at night or on a Sunday or holiday, and the FSIS veterinary medical officer cannot be obtained; or

        (2) In low volume establishments, when ante mortem inspection cannot be done on the day of slaughter, and the birds to be slaughtered have received ante mortem inspection in the last 24 hours, provided the establishment has an identification and control system over birds that have received ante mortem inspection.

        § 381.71   Condemnation on ante mortem inspection.

#### § § 381.71

        (a) Birds plainly showing on ante mortem inspection any disease or condition, that under §§ 381.80 to 381.93, inclusive, would cause condemnation of their carcasses on post mortem inspection, shall be condemned. Birds which on ante mortem inspection are condemned shall not be dressed, nor shall they be conveyed into any department of the official establishment where poultry products are prepared or held. Poultry which has been condemned on ante mortem inspection and has been killed or died otherwise shall under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service, be disposed of as provided in § 381.95.

        (b) Dead-on-arrival ratites and ratites condemned on ante mortem inspection will be tagged “U.S. Condemned” by an establishment employee under FSIS supervision and disposed of by one of the methods prescribed in § 381.95.

        (c) All seriously crippled ratites and non-ambulatory ratites, commonly termed “downers,” shall be identified as “U.S. Suspects.”

        (d) Ratites exhibiting signs of drug or chemical poisoning shall be withheld from slaughter.

        (e) Ratites identified as “U.S. Suspects” or “U.S. Condemned” may be set aside for treatment. The “U.S. Suspect” or “U.S. Condemned” identification device will be removed by an establishment employee under FSIS supervision following treatment if the bird is found to be free of disease. Such a bird found to have recovered from the condition for which it was treated may be released for slaughter or for purposes other than slaughter, provided that in the latter instance permission is first obtained from the local, State, or Federal sanitary official having jurisdiction over movement of such birds.

        (f) When it is necessary for humane reasons to slaughter an injured ratite at night or Sunday or a holiday, and the Agency veterinary medical officer cannot be obtained, the carcass and all parts shall be kept for inspection, with the head and all viscera except the gastrointestinal tract held by the natural attachment. If all parts are not so kept for inspection, the carcass shall be condemned. If on inspection of a carcass slaughtered in the absence of an inspector, any lesion or other evidence is found indicating that the bird was sick or diseased, or affected with any other condition requiring condemnation of the animal on ante mortem inspection, or if there is lacking evidence of the condition that rendered emergency slaughter necessary, the carcass shall be condemned. Ratites that are sick, dying, or that have been treated with a drug or chemical and presented for slaughter before the required withdrawal period, are not covered by emergency slaughter provisions.

        § 381.72   Segregation of suspects on ante mortem inspection.

#### § § 381.72

        (a) All birds, except ratites, that on ante mortem inspection do not plainly show, but are suspected of being affected with, any disease or condition that under §§ 381.80 to 381.93 of this Part may cause condemnation in whole or in part on post mortem inspection, shall be segregated from the other poultry and held for separate slaughter, evisceration, and post mortem inspection. The inspector shall be notified when such segregated lots are presented for post mortem inspection, and inspection of such birds shall be conducted separately. Such procedure for the correlation of ante mortem and post mortem findings by the inspector, as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, shall be carried out.

        (b) All ratites showing symptoms of disease will be segregated, individually tagged as “U.S. Suspects” by establishment personnel under FSIS supervision with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term “U.S. Suspect,” and held for further examination by an FSIS veterinarian. Depending upon the findings of the veterinarian's examination, these birds will either be passed for regular slaughter, slaughtered as suspects, withheld from slaughter, or condemned on ante mortem. Those ratites affected with conditions that would be readily detected on post mortem inspection need not be individually tagged on ante mortem inspection with the “U.S. Suspect” tag provided that such ratites are segregated and otherwise handled as “U.S. Suspects.” All ratites identified as “U.S. Condemned” shall be tagged by establishment personnel, under FSIS supervision, with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term “U.S. Condemned.”

#### § § 381.73

        If live poultry, which is affected by any contagious disease which is transmissible to man, is brought into an official establishment, such poultry shall be segregated. The slaughtering of such poultry shall be deferred and the poultry shall be dealt with in one of the following ways:

        (a) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the poultry will not create a health hazard, the lot shall be slaughtered separately, subject to ante mortem and post mortem inspection pursuant to the regulations.

        (b) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the poultry will create a health hazard, such poultry may be released for treatment under the control of an appropriate State or Federal agency. If the circumstances are such that release for treatment is impracticable, a careful bird-by-bird ante mortem inspection shall be made, and all birds found to be, or which are suspected of being, affected with a contagious disease transmissible to man shall be condemned.

        § 381.74   Poultry suspected of having biological residues.

#### § § 381.74

        When any poultry at an official establishment is suspected of having been treated with or exposed to any substance that may impart a biological residue that would make their edible tissues adulterated, they shall, at the option of the operator of the establishment, be processed at the establishment and the carcasses and all parts thereof retained under U.S. Retained tags, pending final disposition in accordance with § 381.80, of this part, and other provisions in subpart K; or they shall be slaughtered at the establishment and buried or incinerated in a manner satisfactory to the inspector. Alternatively, such poultry may be returned to the grower, if further holding is likely to result in their not being adulterated by reason of any residue. The Inspection Service will notify the other Federal and State agencies concerned of such action. To aid in determining the amount of residue present in the poultry, officials of the Inspection Service may permit the slaughter of any such poultry for the purpose of collecting tissues for analysis of the residue. Such analysis may include the use of inplant screening procedures designed to detect the presence of antimicrobial residues in any species of poultry.

      Subpart K—Post Mortem Inspection; Disposition of Carcasses and Parts

        § 381.76   Post-mortem inspection under Traditional Inspection, the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS), the New Line Speed (NELS) Inspection System, the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), the New Turkey Inspection System (NTI), and Ratite Inspection.

#### § § 381.76

        (a) A post-mortem inspection shall be made on a bird-by-bird basis on all poultry eviscerated in every official establishment. Each carcass, or all parts comprising such carcass, must be examined by an inspector, except for parts that are not needed for inspection purposes and are not intended for human food and are condemned. Each carcass eviscerated shall be prepared as ready-to-cook poultry.

        (b)(1) There are six systems of post-mortem inspection: the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), which may be used for young chickens and turkeys; the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS) and the New Line Speed Inspection System (NELS), both of which may be used only for broilers and cornish game hens; the New Turkey Inspection (NTI) System, which may be used only for turkeys; Traditional Inspection, which may be used for all poultry, except for ratites; and Ratite Inspection.

        (i) The SIS shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:

        () The Administr_a_tor determines that SIS will increase inspector efficiency; or

        () The operator requests SIS and the Administrator determines that the system will result in no loss of inspection efficiency.

        (ii) The NELS Inspection System shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:

        () The oper_a_tor requests the NELS Inspection System, and

        () The Administrator determines that the esta_b_lishment has the intent and capability to operate at line speeds greater than 70 birds per minute, and meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(d).

        (iii) The NTI System shall be used only for turkeys if:

        () The oper_a_tor requests it, and

        () The Administrator determines that the esta_b_lishment meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(e).

        (iv) The NPIS may be used for young chickens and turkeys if the official establishment requests to use it and meets or agrees to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section and the Administrator approves the establishment's request. The Administrator may permit establishments that slaughter classes of poultry other than young chickens and turkeys to operate under the New Poultry Inspection System under a waiver from the provisions of the regulations as provided in § 381.3(b).

        (v) Traditional Inspection shall be used for turkeys when neither the NTI System nor the NPIS is used. For other classes of poultry, Traditional Inspection shall be used when SIS, NELS, and the NPIS are not used.

        (2) Official establishments that operate under Traditional Inspection, SIS, NELS, NTI, or Ratite Inspection must meet the following requirements:

        (i) No viscera or any part thereof may be removed from any poultry processed in any official establishment, except at the time of post-mortem inspection, unless its identity with the rest of the carcass is maintained in a manner satisfactory to the inspector until such inspection is made.

        (ii) Each carcass to be eviscerated must be opened so as to expose the organs and the body cavity for proper examination by the inspector.

        (iii) If a carcass is frozen, it must be thoroughly thawed before being opened for examination by an inspector.

        (3) The following requirements are applicable to SIS:

        (i)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions shall apply:

        ()  A st_a_tistical concept used by the establishment and monitored by the inspector whereby compliance is determined based on sample results collected over a period of time. For purposes of determining compliance with the finished product standards, the CUSUM is equal to the sum of prior test results plus the weighted result of the current test minus the tolerance, with the condition that the resulting CUSUM cannot go below zero.

        ()  A weighted measure that equates to product _b_eing produced at a national product quality level. See Table 2.

        ()  A level rea_c_hed by the CUSUM where the process is out of control and product action is required by the establishment or the inspector. See Table 2.

        () “Start number”. A value halfway between zero an_d_ the action number. The start number is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the first subgroup of a shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equal to or greater than the action number. See Table 2.

        ()  A 10-bird sampl_e_ collected before product enters the chiller and after product leaves the chiller.

        ()  The tolerance number plus 5. See Table 2.

        ()  Testin_g_ conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system.

        ()  Testing conducted by t_h_e establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected as the product leaves the chilling system.

        ()  Reprocess_i_ng the product to correct the condition or conditions causing the nonconformances listed in Table 1.

        (ii) ) Under SIS, one inspector inspects the outside, inside, and viscera of each bird. There may be two inspectors on one processing line, each inspecting every other bird. For the establishment to run its processing line(s) at maximum speed, optimal conditions must be maintained so that inspection may be conducted efficiently. The inspector in charge determines the speed at which each processing line may be operated to permit inspection. A variety of conditions may affect this determination including the health of each flock and the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection.

        () SIS may _b_e performed by one inspector (SIS-1) or two inspectors (SIS-2). SIS-1 requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-1 is 35 birds per minute. SIS-2 requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-2 is 70 birds per minute.

        () Under all inspe_c_tion systems, including SIS, inspectors conduct post-mortem inspection and look for a number of conditions, as specified elsewhere in this subpart, which may indicate adulteration. Adulterated product is condemned and destroyed, except that carcasses and parts which may be made unadulterated by reprocessing (reworking) may be so reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and reinspected. Under SIS, inspectors also reinspect product by sampling finished birds (both before and after chilling) for nonconformances with finished product standards (see Table 1). If such nonconformances are present at certain statistical levels, it may indicate process difficulties requiring corrective action by the establishment. If the establishment does not take adequate corrective action, the inspector shall initiate corrective actions such as conducting closer post-mortem inspections and requiring reprocessing and reinspection of previously processed carcasses and parts. Thus, SIS is conducted in two phases—a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The following paragraphs describe the inspection requirements (not addressed elsewhere in this subpart) under each.

        (iii)  () F_a_cilities: Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(c).

        () Presentation: Each inspector shall _b_e flanked by an establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on the SIS-1 line shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on the SIS-2 line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented.

        () Disposition: The inspe_c_tor shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to trim and reinspection. Carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:

        () The helper, time permitting, and

        () One or more plant trimmers positioned after all giblets are harvested and prior to reinspection.

        (iv)  () F_a_cilities: Reinspection stations are required at both the prechill and postchill locations. The Agency will determine the number of stations needed in those establishments having more than one processing line or more than one chiller. One or more prechill reinspection stations shall be conveniently located at the end of the line or lines prior to chilling. One or more postchill stations must be conveniently located at the end of the chiller or chillers. The prechill and postchill reinspection stations must meet the following provisions:

        () Floor space shall consist of 3 feet along each conveyor line. The space shall be level and protected from all traffic and overhead obstructions.

        () A table at least _2_ feet wide and 2 feet deep and 3 feet in height designed to be readily cleanable and drainable shall be provided for reinspecting the sampled birds.

        () A minimum of 200 foot-candles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index of 85 on the table surface.

        () A separate clip board holder shall be provided for holding the recording sheets.

        () Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of the person at the station.

        () Disposition: An inspe_c_tor shall monitor the esta_b_lishment's application of the Finished Product Standards program and shall take corrective action including retaining product to prevent adulterated product from leaving the establishment when the inspector determines that the establishment has failed to apply the program as prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)() of this section).

        () Finished Produ_c_t Standards: Finished Product Standards (FPS) are criteria applied to processed birds before and after chill to ensure that the product being produced is consistently wholesome and unadulterated. These criteria consist of nonconformances (listed in Table 1), the incidence of which is determined from 10 bird subgroup samples, reduced to a CUSUM number, and measured against the standards (Table 2). The standards are applied to permit the Agency to estimate when the production process is in control and when it is out of control. The establishment is responsible for maintaining FPS which, in turn, is monitored by the inspector. FPS is applied in two separate parts. The first is called prechill testing. It is designed to ensure that the slaughter and evisceration procedures are in control. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system. The second part of the FPS is called postchill testing. It is designed to monitor the production through the chill system to ensure that it meets the postchill FPS. This test is independent of the prechill test. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples as they exit the chilling system. When the system is operating within compliance, the establishment applies the FPS to product samples at the prechill reinspection station. Testing time and time between tests are such that birds represented by the test are still within the chiller. If an out-of-compliance condition is found, the product leaving the chiller is segregated for rework and retested before it may proceed into commerce. A second 10 bird subgroup sample of the birds is taken after they leave the chiller to ensure that the product meets the postchill FPS. Since the product is closer to the end of processing, the controls on releasing reworked product are stricter than controls under prechill testing, again to ensure that no adulterated product enters into commerce.

        ()  The prechill FPS have been _d_ivided into processing and trim categories. The processing category is designed to monitor the output of the dressing and evisceration procedures. The trim category monitors the establishment's ability to remove unwholesome lesions and conditions from inspected and passed carcasses. Each category is monitored independently of the other category using a separate CUSUM for each category.

        ()  If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.

        () Establ_i_shment Actions. The establishment shall:

        () Randomly select and record subgroup sampling times for each production unit of time before product reaches the prechill reinspection station on the production line. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 1 hour of production time.

        () Conduct a 10-bird subgroup test at a random time on each poultry slaughter line. These times are preselected by the establishment and available to the inspector prior to the start of the shift/day's operations. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time.

        () Obtain the weighted value of each nonconformance by multiplying the number recorded for each nonconformance by the “factor” in Table 1, sum the total of all the nonconformances, and calculate the _C_USUM value for that test.

        () Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:

        () Select random times for monitoring subgroup tests for each half-shift on the evisceration line. In establishments that have multiple evisceration lines on a production shift, monitor all lines of product at the random times.

        () Collect the subgroup samples to be monitore_d_ at preselected times. _A_ll _1_0 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time selected in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)()()()() of this section.

        () _C_onduct the 10-bird monitoring subgroup test.

        ()  If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5 (T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the immediate past 5 plant prechill subgroups for that category (processing or trim) resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.

        () If all of the past 5 plant prech_i_ll subgroups are at or below the start number, the establishment shall imme_d_iately conduct a retest subgroup on that category of prechill to determine sample validity. If retest subgroup total equals tolerance or less, the establishment resumes random time testing. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)()() of this section. In either case, the prechill retest results will be used to calculate CUSUM.

        () If any of the past 5 plant prechill subgroups resulte_d_ in a CUSUM above the start number, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)()() of this section.

        ()  If either inspection or plant monitoring fin_d_s any trimmable lesion or condition as specified in item B(7) of Table _1_ during a prechill subgroup test, the establishment shall immediately conduct an additional prechill subgroup test for the same trimmable lesion/condition category. This is a requirement on the subgroup testing for the prechill trim nonconformance that is in addition to the CUSUM test described in paragraph (b)(_3_)(iv)()() of this section.

        () If no add_i_tional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall resume random time sampling.

        () If an a_d_ditional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall initiate corrective action set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)()() of this section for this category only.

        ()  Once CUSUM reaches the action number, the process is judged to be not in control.

        () Establ_i_shment Actions. The establishment shall:

        () Immediately notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for the affected evisceration line.

        () Suspend random time prechill testing of the affected nonconformance category (processing or trim). Suspend random time postchill subgroup testing when the processing category is the affected nonconformance category.

        () _C_onduct subgroup retests on carcasses leaving the chill system. Apply the prechill criteria in Table 1 (A) or (B), depending upon which category caused the action, and apply prechill Finished Product Standards as listed in Table 2 to determine product compliance. In no case shall the time between retests exceed 30 minutes of production time. Apply prechill standard criteria at the postchill location after notifying the establishment's production supervisor. If any of these subgroup retests on product leaving the chill system result in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, identify for rework subsequent product at the postchill location. All noncomplying product will be brought into compliance prior to release into commerce. Product from the chiller will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.

        () Conduct additional subgroup tests at the prechill reinspection station to determine the adequacy of production corrective action. If the prechill tests results in a subgroup total exceeding the tolerance, notify the production supervisor. The number of additional tests at the postchill reinspection station using prechill standards is increased as required to include the product in the chiller represented by this additional prechill test.

        () After two consecutive additional prechill subgroup tests result in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:

        () Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions by making spot-check observations to ensure that all program requirements are met.

        ()  Postchill subgroups shall b_e_ collected after the product leaves the chiller but before the product is divided into separate processes. Each bird sampled shall be observed and its conformance measured against the postchill criteria. The subgroup nonconformance weights shall be totaled and the CUSUM calculated by subtracting the tolerance from the sum of the subgroup total and the starting CUSUM.

        ()  If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.

        () Establ_i_shment Actions. The establishment shall conduct a 10-bird subgroup test for each chiller system at a randomly selected time of production. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 2 hours of production time.

        () Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:

        () Select random times for postchill monitoring.

        () Monitor each chill system twice per shift.

        () _C_onduct subgroup tests at preselected random times.

        ()  If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5(T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the last 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.

        () If all of th_e_ past 5 postch_i_ll monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM at or below the start number, the establishment shall immediately retest a subgroup to determine sample validity. If this retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(_3_)(iv)()() of this section.

        () If any of th_e_ past 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(_3_)(iv)()() of this section.

        ()  Once CUSUM reaches the action number, the process is judged to be not in control.

        () Establ_i_shment Actions. The establishment shall:

        () Notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for product in the chiller.

        () Suspend random time postchill subgroup testing.

        () Immediately conduct an additional postchill subgroup test. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall identify subsequent product for rework. Product will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.

        () After two consecutive additional postchill subgroup tests results in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:

        () Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions to ensure that program requirements are met.

        (v) When the prechill or postchill product has been identified as having been produced when the process was not in control, additional online subgroup testing by the establishment is required to determine its conformance to the standard. If any of the additional plant subgroup testing results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, offline product corrective actions must take place. The responsibilities of the establishment and the inspector change depending on the CUSUM.

        All corrective actions such as identifying affected product, segregating product, and maintaining control through rework actions are the establishment's responsibility. Corrective actions by the inspector depends upon the establishment's ability to control rework of affected product. If the establishment fails in its responsibilities, the inspector will identify, segregate, and retain affected product to prevent adulterated product from reaching consumers.

        () Offline product. The est_a_blishment shall identify the affected product so that it may be segregated and accumulated offline for rework. The inspector shall spot check the establishment's identification, segregation, and control of reworked product to ensure that program requirements are met.

        () Reworked product. Reworked product must _b_e tested by the establishment with a randomly selected subgroup test of the accumulated reworked lot. Before product is released, the random subgroup test must result in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance. If the subgroup test of a reworked lot results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, the lot must be reworked again before another subgroup is selected. The following actions are required.

        () Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:

        () Select the random subgroup from throughout the lot only after the total lot has been reworked.

        () Conduct the subgroup test using the same criteria (prechill or postchill) that resulted in the rework action.

        () Release the lot if the reworked subgroup test resulted in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.

        () Identify and control the lot to be reworked if the reworked subgroup total again exceeds tolerance.

        () Inspector Actions: The inspector shall spot check the rework procedure to ensure that plant monitoring and production meet the requirements of the program.

        (vi) After the 10 bird subgroup tests are completed, the prechill and postchill processing nonconformances shall be corrected on all bird samples prior to returning the samples to the product flow. Samples with trim nonconformances shall be returned to the trim station for correction prior to their return to the product flow.

        (4) The following requirements are also applicable to NELS inspection:

        (i) Inspection under NELS is conducted in two phases, as post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase.

        ()  The est_a_blishment shall provide three inspection stations on each eviscerating line in compliance with the facility requirements § 381.36(d)(1). The three inspectors shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. Each inspector shall be flanked by two establishment employees—the presenter and the helper. The presenter shall ensure that the bird is properly eviscerated and presented for inspection and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. The inspector shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. Poultry carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming or birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:

        () The helper, time permitting, and

        () One or more plant trimmers positioned after giblet harvest and prior to reinspection.

        () A reinspection station shall _b_e located at the end of each line. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(d)(2). The inspector shall ensure that the establishment has performed the indicated trimming of carcasses passed subject to reinspection by visually monitoring, checking data, or gathering samples at the station or at other critical points on the line.

        (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]

        (iv) The maximum inspection rate for NELS shall be 91 birds per minute per eviscerating line.

        (5) The following requirements are also applicable to the NTI System:

        (i) Inspection under the NTI System is conducted in two phases, a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The NTI-1 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilitiates so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The NTI-2 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation.

        ()  E_a_ch inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(e)(1). Each inspector shall be flanked by and establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on an NTI-1 Inspection System shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on an NTI-2 Inspection System line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. The inspector shall determine which bird shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by a veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. Turkey carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:

        () The helper, time permitting, and

        () One or more plant trimmers positioned after the giblet harvest and prior to reinspection.

        ()  A reinspection station shall _b_e located at the end of the lines. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(e)(2). The inspector shall ensure that establishments have performed the indicated trimming of each carcass passed subject to reinspection by visually monitoring, checking data, and/or sampling product at the reinspection station and, if necessary, at other points, critical to the wholesomeness of product, on the eviscerating line.

        (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]

        (6) The following requirements are applicable to the NPIS:

        (i)  The establishment must comply with the facilities requirements in § 381.36(f).

        (ii)  (A) The establishment must conduct carcass with associated viscera sorting activities, dispose of carcasses and parts exhibiting condemnable conditions, and conduct appropriate trimming and reprocessing activities before carcasses are presented to the online carcass inspector.

        (B) Any carcasses removed from the line for reprocessing activities or salvage must be returned to the line before the online carcass inspection station. The establishment must include in its written HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program a process by which parts, other than parts identified as “major portions” as defined in § 381.170(b)(22), are available for inspection offline after reprocessing or salvage.

        (C) The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to ensure that poultry carcasses contaminated with septicemic and toxemic conditions do not enter the chiller. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program. These procedures must cover, at a minimum, establishment sorting activities required under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.

        (D) The establishment must maintain records to document that the products resulting from its slaughter operation meet the definition of ready-to-cook poultry in § 381.1. These records are subject to review and evaluation by FSIS personnel.

        (iii)  To ensure the online carcass inspector may properly inspect every carcass, the establishment must present carcasses as follows:

        (A) Each carcass, except carcasses and parts identified as “major portions” under 9 CFR 381.179(b)(22), must be held by a single shackle;

        (B) Both hocks of each carcass must be held by the shackle;

        (C) The back side of the carcass must be faced toward the inspector;

        (D) There must be minimal carcass swinging motion;

        (E) The establishment must ensure that it can sufficiently identify viscera and parts corresponding with each carcass inspected by the online carcass inspector so that if the carcass inspector condemns a carcass all corresponding viscera and parts are also condemned.

#### § § 381.94

        (a)   (1) Each official establishment that slaughters ratites shall test for  Biotype I (). Establishments that slaughter ratites and livestock, shall test the type of ratites or livestock slaughtered in the greatest number. The establishment shall:

        (i) Collect samples in accordance with the sampling techniques, methodology, and frequency requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

        (ii) Obtain analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

        (iii) Maintain records of such analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (2)  (i)  Each establishment that slaughters ratites shall prepare written specimen collection procedures which shall identify employees designated to collect samples, and shall address location(s) of sampling, how sampling randomness is achieved, and handling of the sample to ensure sample integrity. The written procedure shall be made available to FSIS upon request.

        (ii)  The establishment must collect samples from whole ratites at the end of the chilling process. Samples from ratites may be collected by sponging the carcass on the back and thigh or samples can be collected by rinsing the whole carcass in an amount of buffer appropriate for that type of bird.

        (iii)  Establishments that slaughter ratites, except very low volume ratite establishments as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, must take samples at a frequency proportional to the establishment's volume of production at the following rate: 1 sample per 3,000 carcasses, but at a minimum one sample each week of operation.

        (iv)  An establishment operating under a validated HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.2(b) of this chapter may substitute an alternative frequency for the frequency of sampling required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section if,

        (A) The alternative is an integral part of the establishment's verification procedures for its HACCP plan and,

        (B) FSIS does not determine, and notify the establishment in writing, that the alternative frequency is inadequate to verify the effectiveness of the establishment's processing controls.

        (v)  (A) Very low volume ratite establishments annually slaughter no more than 6,000 ratites. Very low volume ratite establishments that slaughter ratites in the largest number must collect at least one sample during each week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until June of the following year or until 13 samples have been collected, whichever comes first.

        (B) Upon the establishment's meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section, weekly sampling and testing is optional, unless changes are made in establishment facilities, equipment, personnel or procedures that may affect the adequacy of existing process control measures, as determined by the establishment or by FSIS. FSIS determinations that changes have been made requiring resumption of weekly testing shall be provided to the establishment in writing.

        (3)  Laboratories may use any quantitative method for analysis of  that is approved as an AOAC Official Method of the AOAC International (formerly the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) or approved and published by a scientific body and based on the results of a collaborative trial conducted in accordance with an internationally recognized protocol on collaborative trials and compared against the three tube Most Probable Number (MPN) method and agreeing with the 95 percent upper and lower confidence limit of the appropriate MPN index.

        (4)  The establishment shall maintain accurate records of all test results, in terms of colony forming units (CFU)/ml of rinse fluid. Results shall be recorded onto a process control chart or table showing at least the most recent 13 test results. Records shall be retained at the establishment for a period of 12 months and shall be made available to FSIS upon request.

        (5) Establishments shall evaluate  test results using statistical process control techniques.

        (6)  Test results that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are an indication that the establishment may not be maintaining process controls sufficient to prevent fecal contamination. FSIS shall take further action as appropriate to ensure that all applicable provisions of the law are being met.

        (7)  Inspection will be suspended in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for such proceeding, upon a finding by FSIS that one or more provisions of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section have not been complied with and written notice of same has been provided to the establishment.

      Subpart L—Handling and Disposal of Condemned or Other Inedible Products at Official Establishments

        § 381.95   Disposal of condemned poultry products.

#### § § 381.95

        All condemned carcasses, or condemned parts of carcasses, or other condemned poultry products, except those condemned for biological residues shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service. (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishment.)

        (a) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle or vat, for a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. (Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection by means of pipes, or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.)

      Subpart N—Labeling and Containers

        § 381.115   Containers of inspected and passed poultry products required to be labeled.

#### § § 381.115

        Except as may be authorized in specific cases by the Administrator with respect to shipment of poultry products between official establishments, each shipping container and each immediate container of any inspected and passed poultry product shall at the time it leaves the official establishment bear a label which contains information, and has been approved, in accordance with this subpart.

        § 381.116   Wording on labels of immediate containers.

#### § § 381.116

        (a) Each label for use on immediate containers for inspected and passed poultry products shall bear on the principal display panel (except as otherwise permitted in the regulations), the items of information required by this subpart. Such items of information shall be in distinctly legible form. Except as provided in § 381.128, all words, statements and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language:  That in the case of products distributed solely in Puerto Rico, Spanish may be substituted for English for all printed matter except the USDA inspection legend.

        (b) The principal display panel shall be the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by the regulations with clarity and conspicuousness and without being obscured by design or vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. The area that is to bear the principal display panel shall be:

        (1) In the case of a rectangular package, one entire side, the area of which is the product of the height times the width of that side.

        (2) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container:

        (i) An area on the side of the container that is 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference, or

        (ii) A panel, the width of which is one-third of the circumference and the height of which is as high as the container:  That there is, immediately to the right or left of such principal display panel, a panel which has a width not greater than 20 percent of the circumference and a height as high as the container, and which is reserved for information prescribed in §§ 381.118, 381.122, and 381.123. Such panel shall be known as the “20 percent panel” and such information may be shown on that panel in lieu of showing it on the principal display panel as provided in this § 381.116.

        (3) In the case of a container of any other shape, 40 percent of the total surface of the container.

        (c) (1) The information panel is that part of a label that is the first surface to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, with the following exceptions:

        (i) If the first surface to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the required information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps, tear strips, opening flaps, heat-sealed flaps, the next panel to the right of this part of the label may be used.

        (ii) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is to the right of any principal display panel.

        (iii) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.

        (2) (i) Except as otherwise permitted in this part, all information required to appear on the principal display panel or permitted to appear on the information panel shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, except as otherwise prescribed in this part, any vignettes, designs, and any other nonmandatory information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all required information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between the principal display panel and the information panel, provided that the information required by any given provision of this part, such as the ingredients statement, is not divided and appears on the same panel.

        (ii) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without intervening material, such as designs or vignettes.

        § 381.117   Name of product and other labeling.

#### § § 381.117

        (a) The label shall show the name of the product, which, in the case of a poultry product which purports to be or is represented as a product for which a definition and standard of identity or composition is prescribed in subpart P, shall be the name of the food specified in the standard, and in the case of any other poultry product shall be the common or usual name of the food, if any there be, and if there is none, a truthful descriptive designation.

        (b) The name of the product required to be shown on labels for fresh or frozen raw whole carcasses of poultry shall be in either of the following forms: The name of the kind (such as chicken, turkey, or duck) preceded by the qualifying term “young” or “mature” or “old”, whichever is appropriate; or the appropriate class name as described in § 381.170(a). The name of the kind may be used in addition to the class name, but the name of the kind alone without the qualifying age or class term is not acceptable as the name of the product, except that the name “chicken” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen cut-up young chickens, or a half of a young chicken, and the name “duckling” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen young ducks. The class name may be appropriately modified by changing the word form, such as using the term “roasting chicken”, rather than “roaster.” The appropriate names for cut-up parts are set forth in § 381.170(b). When naming parts cut from young poultry, the identity of both the kind of poultry and the name of the part shall be included in the product name. The product name for parts or portions cut from mature poultry shall include, along with the part or portion name, the class name or the qualifying term “mature.” The name of the product for cooked or heat processed poultry products shall include the kind name of the poultry from which the product was prepared but need not include the class name or the qualifying term “mature.”

        (c) Poultry products containing light and dark chicken or turkey meat in quantities other than the natural proportions, as indicated in Table 1 in this paragraph, must have a qualifying statement in conjunction with the name of the product indicating, as shown in Table 1, the types of meat actually used, except that when the product contains less than 10 percent cooked deboned poultry meat or is processed in such a manner that the character of the light and dark meat is not distinguishable, the qualifying statement will not be required, unless the product bears a label referring to the light or dark meat content. In the latter case, the qualifying statement is required if the light and dark meat are not present in natural proportions. The qualifying statement must be in type at least one-half the size and of equal boldness as the name of the product; e.g., Boned Turkey (Dark Meat).

        (d) Boneless poultry products shall be labeled in a manner that accurately describes their actual form and composition. The product name shall specify the form of the product (e.g., emulsified, finely chopped, etc.), and the kind name of the poultry, and if the product does not consist of natural proportions of skin and fat, as they occur in the whole carcass, shall also include terminology that describes the actual composition. If the product is cooked, it shall be so labeled. For the purpose of this paragraph, natural proportions of skin, as found on a whole chicken or turkey carcass, will be considered to be as follows:

        (e) On the label of any “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry) “ described in § 381.173, the name of such product shall be followed immediately by the phrase: “with excess skin” unless such product is made from poultry product that does not include skin in excess of the natural proportion of skin present on the whole carcass, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Appropriate terminology on the label shall indicate if heat treatment has been used in the preparation of the product. The labeling information described in this paragraph shall be identified on the label before the product leaves the establishment at which it is manufactured.

        (f) The labels of sausages encased in natural casings made from meat or poultry viscera shall identify the type of meat or poultry from which the casings were derived, if the casings are from a different type of meat or poultry than the encased meat or poultry. The identity of the casing, if required, may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement. Establishments producing, manufacturing, or using natural sausage casings are to maintain records documenting the meat or poultry source in accordance with subpart Q of this part.

        (g) The labels of sausages encased in regenerated collagen casings shall disclose this fact on the product label. The fact that the sausage is encased in collagen may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement.

        (h) The product name for a raw poultry product that contains added solution and does not meet a standard of identity in this part must contain a descriptive designation that includes:

        (1) The percentage of added solution (total weight of the solution ingredients divided by the weight of the raw poultry without solution or any other added ingredients multiplied by 100). The percentage of added solution must appear as a number (such as, 15, 20, 30) and the percent symbol (%). The percentage of added solution may be declared by the words “containing” or “contains” (such as, “contains 15% added solution of water and salt,” or “containing 15% added solution of water and teriyaki sauce”).

        (2) The common or usual name of all individual ingredients or multi-ingredient components in the solution listed in descending order of predominance by weight.

        (3) When the descriptive designation includes all ingredients in the solution, a separate ingredients statement is not required on the label. When the descriptive designation includes multi-ingredient components and the ingredients of the component are not declared in the product name, all ingredients in the product must be declared in a separate ingredients statement on the label as required in § 381.118.

        (4) The product name and the descriptive designation must be printed in a single easy-to-read type style and color and must appear on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than one-third ( ) the size of the largest letter.

        (5) The word “enhanced” cannot be used in the product name.

        § 381.118   Ingredients statement.

#### § § 381.118

        (a)(1) The label shall show a statement of the ingredients in the poultry product if the product is fabricated from two or more ingredients. Such ingredients shall be listed by their common or usual names in the order of their descending proportions, except as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2)(i) Product ingredients which are present in individual amounts of 2 percent or less by weight may be listed in the ingredients statement in other than descending order of predominance:  That such ingredients are listed by their common or usual names at the end of the ingredients statement and preceded by a quantifying statement, such as “Contains __________ percent or less of __________ ,” or “Less than __________ percent of __________ .” The percentage of the ingredient(s) shall be filled in with a threshold level of 2 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.0 percent, or 0.5 percent, as appropriate. No ingredient to which the quantifying statement applies may be present in an amount greater than the stated threshold. Such a quantifying statement may also be utilized when an ingredients statement contains a listing of ingredients by individual components. Each component listing may utilize the required quantifying statement at the end of each component ingredients listing.

        (ii) Such ingredients may be adjusted in the product formulation without a change being made in the ingredients statement on the labeling, provided that the adjusted amount complies with subpart P of this part and § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, and does not exceed the amount shown in the quantifying statement. Any such adjustments to the formulation shall be provided to the inspector-in-charge.

        (b) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “chicken meat,” unless modified by an appropriate adjective, is construed to mean deboned white and dark meat; whereas the term “chicken” may include other edible parts such as skin and fat not in excess of their natural proportions, in addition to the chicken meat. If the term “chicken meat” is listed and the product also contains skin, giblets, or fat, it is necessary to list each such ingredient. Similar principles shall be followed in listing ingredients of poultry products processed from other kinds of poultry.

        (c) The terms spice, natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may be used in the following manner:

        (1) The term “spice” means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, with the exceptions of onions, garlic and celery, whose primary function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in 21 CFR 182.10, and 184.

        (2) The term “natural flavor,” “natural flavoring,” “flavor” or “flavoring” means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powdered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.

        (i) Natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring as described in paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section, which are also colors shall be designated as “natural flavor and coloring,” “natural flavoring and coloring,” “flavor and coloring” or “flavoring and coloring” unless designated by their common or usual name.

        (ii) Any ingredient not designated in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock or poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.

        (d) On containers of frozen dinners, entrees, and pizzas, and similarly packaged products in cartons, the ingredient statement may be placed on the front riser panel:  That the words “see ingredients,” followed immediately by an arrow pointing to the front riser panel, are placed on the principal display panel immediately above the location of such statement, without intervening printing or designs.

        (e) The ingredients statement may be placed on the information panel, except as otherwise permitted in this subchapter.

        (f) Establishments may interchange the identity of two kinds of poultry (e.g., chicken and turkey, chicken meat and turkey meat) used in a product formulation without changing the product's ingredient statement or product name under the following conditions:

        (1)(i) The two kinds of poultry used must comprise at least 70 percent by weight of the poultry and the poultry ingredients [e.g. giblets, skin or fat in excess of natural proportions, or mechanically separated (kind)] used; and,

        (ii) Neither of the two kinds of poultry used can be less than 30 percent by weight of the total poultry and poultry ingredients used;

        (2) The word “and” in lieu of a comma must be shown between the declaration of the two kinds of poultry in the ingredients statement and in the product name.

        (a) When an artificial smoke flavoring or a smoke flavoring is added as an ingredient in the formula of any poultry product, there shall appear on the label, in prominent letters and contiguous to the name of the product, a statement such as “Artificial Smoke Flavoring Added” or “Smoke Flavoring Added,” as applicable, and the ingredient statement shall identify any artificial smoke flavoring or smoke flavoring added as an ingredient in the formula of the poultry product.

        (b) Any poultry product which bears or contains any artificial flavoring other than an artificial smoke flavoring or a smoke flavoring, or bears or contains any artificial coloring shall bear a statement stating that fact on the immediate container or, if there is none, on the product.

        § 381.120   Antioxidants; chemical preservatives; and other additives.

#### § § 381.120

        When an antioxidant is added to a poultry product, there shall appear on the label in prominent letters and contiguous to the name of the product, a statement showing the name of the antioxidant and the purpose for which it is added, such as “BHA added to help protect the flavor.” Immediate containers of poultry products packed in, bearing, or containing any chemical preservative shall bear a label stating that fact and naming the additive and the purpose of its use. Immediate containers of poultry products packed in, bearing or containing any other chemical additive shall bear a label naming the additive and the purpose of its use when required by the Administrator in specific cases. When approved proteolytic enzymes as permitted in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B of this subchapter are used in mature poultry muscle tissue, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement “Tenderized with [approved enzyme],” to indicate the use of such enzymes. Any other approved substance which may be used in the solution shall also be included in the statement. When approved inorganic chlorides as permitted in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B of this subchapter are used in mature poultry muscle tissue, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement, “Tenderized with (name of approved inorganic chloride(s))” to indicate the use of such inorganic chlorides.

        § 381.121   Quantity of contents.

#### § § 381.121

        (a) The label shall bear a statement of the quantity of contents in terms of weight or measures as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. However, the Administrator may approve the use of labels for certain types of consumer packages which do not bear a statement of the net weight that would otherwise be required under this subparagraph:  That the shipping container bears a statement “Net weight to be marked on consumer packages prior to display and sale”:  That the total net weight of the contents of the shipping container is marked on such container:  That the shipping container bears a statement “Tare weight of consumer package” and in close proximity thereto, the actual tare weight (weight of packaging material), weighed to the nearest one-eighth ounce or less, of the individual consumer package in the shipping container. The above-specified statements may be added to approved shipping container labels upon approval by the inspector in charge.

        (b) When a poultry product and a nonpoultry product are separately wrapped and are placed in a single immediate container bearing the same name of both products, the net weight on such immediate container may be the total net weight of the products, or such immediate container may show the net weights of the poultry product and the nonpoultry product separately. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, the label on consumer size retail packages of stuffed poultry and other stuffed poultry products must show the total net weight of the poultry product, and in close proximity thereto, a statement specifying the minimum weight of the poultry in the product.

        (c)(1) The statement of net quantity of contents shall appear (except as otherwise permitted under this paragraph (c)), on the principal display panel of all containers to be sold at retail intact, in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other matter on the container, and shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c). An unused tare weight, as defined in section 381.121b of this subchapter, may be printed adjacent to the statement of net quantity of contents when the product is packaged totally with impervious packaging material and is packed with a usable medium.

        (2) The statement shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the panel, in lines generally parallel to the base:  That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the statement meets the other requirements of this paragraph. The declaration may appear in more than one line.

        (3) The statement shall be in letters and numerals in type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:

        (i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less;

        (ii) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches;

        (iii) Not less than three-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches;

        (iv) Not less than one-quarter inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 but not more than 400 square inches;

        (v) Not less than one-half inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 400 square inches.

        (vi) The ratio of height to width of letters and numerals shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). This height standard pertains to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the height standards.

        (4) The statement shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel and shall be separated, from other label information appearing to the left or right of the statement, by a space at least equal in width to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement and shall be separated from other label information appearing above or below the statement by a space at least equal in height to the height of the lettering used in the statement.

        (5) The terms “net weight” or “net wt.” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight, and the term “net contents” or “contents” when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of fluid measure. Except as provided in § 381.128, the statement shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois weight or liquid measure. Where no general consumer usage to the contrary exists, the statement shall be in terms of liquid measure, if the product is liquid, or in terms of weight if the product is solid, semi-solid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid. On packages containing less than 1 pound or 1 pint, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or fractions of a pint, respectively. On packages containing 1 pound or 1 pint or more, and less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or in pounds with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pint or quart. For example, a declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz.”; a declaration of 1  pounds avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1 lb. 8 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1  lb.,” or “Net Wt. 1.5 lbs.”. However, on random weight packages the statement shall be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound, for packages over 1 pound, and for packages which do not exceed 1 pound the statement may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces. The numbers may be written in provided the unit designation is printed. Paragraphs (c)(8) and (9) of this section permit certain exceptions to this paragraph (c)(5) for multi-unit packages, and random weight consumer size and small packages (less than   ounce), respectively.

        (6) The statement as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practices will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall be as provided in section 381.121b of this subchapter. The statement shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count such as “jumbo quart,” “full gallon,” “giant quart,” “when packed,” “minimum,” or words of similar importance except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (7) Labels for containers which bear any representation as to the number of servings contained therein shall bear, contiguous to such representation, and in the same size type as is used for such representation, a statement of the net quantity of each such serving.

        (8) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces. “A multiunit retail package” is a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, with the individual packages intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being sold individually. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units and the labeling thereon are not subject to this paragraph (c) (8) if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of this paragraph (c).

        (9) The following exemptions from the requirements contained in this section are hereby established:

        (i) Individually wrapped, random weight consumer size packages of poultry products (as specified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section) and poultry products that are subject to shrinkage through moisture loss during good distribution practices and are designated as gray area type of products as defined in NBS handbook 133, section 3.18.2, need not bear a net weight statement when shipped from an official establishment provided a net weight shipping statement which meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section is applied to the shipping container prior to shipping it from the official establishment. Net weight statements so applied to the shipping container are exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the shipping container. The net weight also shall be applied directly to random weight consumer size packages prior to retail display and sale. The net weight statement of random weight consumer size packages for retail sale shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.

        (ii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than   ounce net weight and random weight consumer size packages shall be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they are in a shipping container and the statement of net quantity of contents on the shipping container meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section;

        (iii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than   ounce net weight bearing labels declaring net weight, price per pound, and total price, shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.

        (10) As used in this section a “random weight consumer size package” is one of a lot, shipment or delivery of packages of the same product, with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern.

        § 381.125   Special handling label requirements.

#### § § 381.125

        (a) Packaged products which require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition shall have prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label the statement: “Keep Refrigerated,” “Keep Frozen,” “Keep Refrigerated or Frozen,” “Perishable—Keep Under Refrigeration,” or such similar statement as the Administrator may approve in specific cases. The immediate containers for products that are frozen during distribution and intended to be thawed prior to or during display for sale shall bear the statement “Shipped/Stored and Handled Frozen for Your Protection, Keep Refrigerated or Freeze.” For all canned perishable products, the statement shall be shown in upper case letters one-fourth inch in height for containers having a net weight of 3 pounds or less, and for containers having a net weight over 3 pounds, the statement shall be shown in letters one-half inch in height.

        (b) Safe handling instructions shall be provided for all poultry products not processed in accordance with the provisions of § 381.150(a) or that have not undergone other processing that would render them ready-to-eat, except as exempted under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

        (1) (i) Safe handling instructions shall accompany the poultry products, specified in this paragraph (b), destined for household consumers, hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions and shall appear on the label. The information shall be in lettering no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch in size and shall be prominently placed with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

        (ii) The safe handling information shall be presented on the label under the heading “Safe Handling Instructions” which shall be set in type size larger than the print size of the rationale statement and handling statements as discussed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. The safe handling information shall be set off by a border and shall be one color type printed on a single color contrasting background whenever practical.

        § 381.127   Wording on labels of shipping containers.

#### § § 381.127

        (a) Each label for use on a shipping container for inspected and passed poultry products shall bear, in distinctly legible form, the following information:

        (1) The official inspection legend.

        (2) The official establishment number of the official establishment in which the poultry product was inspected, either within the official inspection mark, or elsewhere on the container clearly visible and in proximity to the official inspection mark.

        § 381.128   Labels in foreign languages.

#### § § 381.128

        Any label to be affixed to a container of any dressed poultry or other poultry product for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language. However, the official inspection legend and establishment number shall appear on the label in English, but in addition, may be literally translated into such foreign language. Each such label shall be subject to the applicable provisions of §§ 381.115 to 381.141, inclusive. Deviations from the form of labeling required under the regulations may be approved by the Administrator in specific cases and such modified labeling may be used for poultry products to be exported:  (a) That the proposed labeling accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser, (b) that it is not in conflict with the Act or the laws of the country to which it is intended for export, and (c) that the outside of the shipping container is labeled to show that it is intended for export; but if such product is sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce, all the requirements of the regulations shall apply.

        § 381.129   False or misleading labeling or containers.

#### § § 381.129

        (a) No poultry product subject to the Act shall have any false or misleading labeling or any container that is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading. However, established trade names and other labeling and containers which are not false or misleading and which are approved by the Administrator in the regulations or in specific cases are permitted.

        (b) No statement, word, picture, design, or device which is false or misleading in any particular or conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin, identity, or quality, shall appear on any label. For example:

        (1) Official grade designations such as the letter grades A, B, and C may be used in labeling individual carcasses of poultry or containers of poultry products only if such articles have been graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State poultry grading service and found to qualify for the indicated grade.

        (2) Statements, words, pictures, designs, or devices having geographical significance with reference to a particular locality must be made in accordance with § 317.8(b)(1) of this chapter.

        (3) “Fresh frozen”, “quick frozen”, “frozen fresh”, and terms of similar import apply only to ready-to-cook poultry processed in accordance with § 381.66(f)(1). Ready-to-cook poultry handled in any other manner and dressed poultry may be labeled “frozen” only if it is frozen in accordance with § 381.66(f)(2) under Department supervision and is in fact in a frozen state. “Individually quick frozen (Kind)” and terms of similar import are applicable only to poultry products that are frozen as stated on the label and whose component parts can be easily separated at time of packing.

        (4) Poultry products labeled with a term quoted in any paragraph of § 381.170(b) shall comply with the specifications in the applicable paragraph. However, parts of poultry may be cut in any manner the processor desires as long as the labeling appropriately reflects the contents of the container of such poultry.

        (5) The terms “All,” “Pure,” “100%,” and terms of similar connotation shall not be used on labels for products to identify ingredient content, unless the product is prepared solely from a single ingredient.

        (6)(i) A raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26  °F may not bear a label declaration of “fresh.” A raw poultry product bearing a label declaration of “fresh” but whose internal temperature has ever been below 26  °F is mislabeled. The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product within an official establishment may deviate below the 26  °F standard by 1 degree (i.e., have a temperature of 25  °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product outside an official establishment may deviate below the 26  °F standard by 2 degrees (i.e., have a temperature of 24  °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The average temperature of poultry product lots of each specific product type must be 26  °F. Product described in this paragraph is not subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.

        (ii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been at or below 0°F must be labeled with the descriptive term “frozen,” except when such labeling duplicates or conflicts with the labeling requirements in § 381.125 of this subchapter. The word “previously” may be placed next to the term “frozen” on an optional basis. The descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed to the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. Product described in this paragraph is subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.

        (iii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, is not required to bear any specific descriptive term. Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, may bear labeling with an optional, descriptive term, provided the optional, descriptive term does not cause the raw poultry product to become misbranded. If used, an optional, descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the optional, descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed on the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

        (iv)  (A) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, when any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral permission is obtained from the Area Supervisor of the area in which that official establishment is located. The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of the relabeling of the product. The Area Supervisor shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.

        (B) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by the inspector, and if it is found that the product is not adulterated, it may be received into the establishment; but if the product is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be condemned and disposed of in accordance with § 381.95 of this subchapter. Wholesome product will be relabeled in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.

        (C) When any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, the owner may transport the product in commerce to a retail entity for relabeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate, or to other end users, such as hotels, restaurants or similar institutions; or, relabel the product in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate if the product is already at a retail entity. A hotel, restaurant or similar institution is not required to relabel product misbranded under this subpart;  That the product is prepared in meals or as entrees only for sale or service directly to individual consumers at such institutions, and that the mark of inspection is removed or obliterated. Oral permission shall be obtained from the Area Officer-in-Charge of the Compliance Program for the area in which the product is located prior to such transportation or relabeling. The Area Officer-in-Charge shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product, and shall furnish a copy of the authorization record upon request. Before being offered for sale at a retail entity, such product shall be relabeled.

        (v) Ready-to-cook chicken may bear the claim “air chilled” or “air chilling” on its label only if the product was chilled under a process that meets the definition of air chilling in § 381.66(e).

        (c) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:

        (1) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.

        (2) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date will be a phrase explaining the meaning of such date in terms of “packing” date, “sell by” date, or “use before” date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., “For Maximum Freshness” or “For Best Quality.”

        (d) When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate are used together in a dry binding matrix in ground or formed poultry products, as permitted in § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name a statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate.

        § 381.144   Packaging materials.

#### § § 381.144

        (a) Edible products may not be packaged in a container which is composed in whole or in part of any poisonous or deleterious substances which may render the contents adulterated or injurious to health. All packaging materials must be safe for the intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FFDCA).

        (b) Packaging materials entering the official establishment must be accompanied or covered by a guaranty, or statement of assurance, from the packaging supplier under whose brand name and firm name the material is marketed to the official establishment. The guaranty shall state that the material's intended use complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations. The guaranty must identify the material, e.g., by the distinguishing brand name or code designation appearing on the packaging material shipping container; must specify the applicable conditions of use, including temperature limits and other pertinent limits specified under the FFDCA and food additive regulations; and must be signed by an authorized official of the supplying firm. The guaranty may be limited to a specific shipment of an article, in which case it may be part of or attached to the invoice covering such shipment, or it may be general and continuing, in which case, in its application to any article or other shipment of an article, it shall be considered to have been given at the date such article was shipped by the person who gives the guaranty. Guaranties consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations regarding such guaranties (21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13) will be acceptable. The management of the establishment must maintain a file containing guaranties for all food contact packaging materials in the establishment. The file shall be made available to Program inspectors or other Department officials upon request. While in the official establishment, the identity of all packaging materials must be traceable to the applicable guaranty.

        (c) The guaranty by the packaging supplier will be accepted by Program inspectors to establish that the use of material complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations.

        (d) The Department will monitor the use of packaging materials in official establishments to assure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and may question the basis for any guaranty described under paragraph (b) of this section. Official establishments and packaging suppliers providing written guaranties to those official establishments will be permitted an opportunity to provide information to designated Department officials as needed to verify the basis for any such guaranty. The required information will include, but is not limited to, manufacturing firm's name, trade name or code designation for the material, complete chemical composition, and use. Selection of a material for review does not in itself affect a material's acceptability. Materials may continue to be used during the review period. However, if information requested from the supplier is not provided within the time indicated in the request—a minimum of 30 days—any applicable guaranty shall cease to be effective and approval to continue using the specified packaging material in official establishments may be denied. The Administrator may extend this time where reasonable grounds for extension are shown, as, for example, where data must be obtained from suppliers.

        (e) The Administrator may disapprove for use in official establishments packaging materials whose use cannot be confirmed as complying with the FFDCA and applicable food additive regulations. Before approval to use a packaging material is finally denied by the Administrator, the affected official establishment and the supplier of the material shall be given notice and the opportunity to present their views to the Administrator. If the official establishment and the supplier do not accept the Administrator's determination, a hearing in accordance with applicable rules of practice will be held to resolve such dispute. Approval to use the materials pending the outcome of the presentation of views or hearing shall be denied if the Administrator determines that such use may present an imminent hazard to public health.

        (f) Periodically, the Administrator will issue to inspectors a listing, by distinguishing brand name or code designation, of packaging materials that have been reviewed and that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Listed materials will not be permitted for use in official establishments. If a subsequent review of any material indicates that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a), the material will be deleted from the listing.

        (g) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of Program inspectors to refuse a specific material if he/she determines the material may render products adulterated or injurious to health.

      Subpart P—Definitions and Standards of Identity or Composition

        § 381.155   General.

#### § § 381.155

        (a)  (1) The Administrator is authorized to establish specifications or definitions and standards of identity or composition, covering the principal constituents of any poultry product with respect to which a specified name of the product or other labeling terminology may be used, whenever he determines such action is necessary to prevent sale of the product under false or misleading labeling. Further, the Administrator is authorized to prescribe definitions and standards of identity or composition for poultry products whenever he determines such action is otherwise necessary for the protection of the public. The requirements of this subpart are hereby found to be necessary for these purposes and standards are hereby established as set forth in this subpart.

        (2) Where cooked poultry meat is specified in this subpart as an ingredient of poultry products, this means poultry meat derived from poultry processed, cooked, and cooled in a manner approved by the Administrator in specific cases without use of liquid or moisture in direct contact with the poultry meat following the cooking and cooling of the poultry.

        (3) If, following cooking and cooling of poultry meat to be used in poultry products, liquid or moisture is used in direct contact with such poultry meat and the percentage of solids, excluding salt, in the poultry meat is found to be below 34 percent when such poultry meat is tested by acceptable methods, the percentage of poultry meat required by this section for any poultry product shall be increased in proportion to the deficiency, or the meat shall be so processed as to raise the solids content, excluding salt, to 34 percent. The official establishment shall furnish adequate facilities for such testing.

        (b) Any binder or antimicrobial agent that has been found to be safe and suitable by the Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection Service may be used in the production of poultry products with standards of identity in this part, where the product standards and applicable Federal regulations already permit the use of these types of ingredients.

        (12) “Quarters” consist of the entire eviscerated poultry carcass, which has been cut into four equal parts, but excluding the neck.

        (13) “Breast quarter” consists of half a breast with the wing and a portion of the back attached.

        (14) “Breast quarter without wing” consists of a front quarter of a poultry carcass, from which the wing has been removed.

        (15) “Leg quarter” consists of a poultry thigh and drumstick, with a portion of the back attached.

        (16) “Thigh with back portion” consists of a poultry thigh with back portion attached.

        (17) “Legs with pelvic bone” consists of a poultry leg with adhering meat and skin and pelvic bone.

        (18) “Wing drummette” consists of the humerus of a poultry wing with adhering skin and meat attached.

        (19) “Wing portion” consists of a poultry wing except that the drummette has been removed.

        (20) “Cut-up Poultry” is any cut-up or disjointed portion of poultry or any edible part thereof, as described in this section.

        (21) “Giblets” consist of approximately equal numbers of hearts, gizzards, and livers, as determined on a count basis.

        (22) “Major portions” of eviscerated poultry carcasses are either carcasses from which parts may be missing, or the front or rear portions of transversely-split carcasses.

        § 381.172   Requirements for substitute standardized poultry products named by use of an expressed nutrient content claim and a standardized term.

#### § § 381.172

        (a)  The poultry products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 381.413(d), for a standardized product defined in this subpart and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in this subpart. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 381.413 and with the requirements in subpart Y of this part which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The poultry product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the poultry product shall be similar to those of the standardized poultry product produced under subpart P of this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 381.413(d)(1) and (2) of this part, that informs the consumer of such differences (, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.

        (c)  (1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in poultry products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part for which it is a substitute.

        (2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in subpart P of this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, extruded turnips shall not replace noodles in poultry with noodles.

        (3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any poultry product by subpart P of this part shall not be added to the substitute poultry product under this section.

        (4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute poultry product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.

        (5) Water and fat-replacers (, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (d)  The name of a substitute poultry product that complies with this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.

        (e)  (1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute poultry product shall be declared on the label as required by this section and subpart N of this part.

        (2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular __________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular __________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.

        § 381.185   Assistance to State and Territorial programs.

#### § § 381.185

        (a) The Administrator is authorized, under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Act, when he determines it would effectuate the purposes of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized territory in developing and administering the poultry product inspection program of such jurisdiction, with a view to assuring that it imposes and enforces requirements at least equal to those under sections 2 through 4, 6 through 10, and 12 through 22 of the Act, with respect to establishments at which poultry are slaughtered or poultry products are processed for use as human food, solely for distribution within such jurisdiction, and with respect to the poultry products of such establishments. Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a mandatory law imposing ante mortem and post mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements (at least equal to those under the Federal Act), with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering poultry or otherwise processing poultry products for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.

        (b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those provided in section 11 of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry; and products not intended for human food) when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.

        (c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or territory) for any year shall not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.

        § 381.186   Cooperation of States and other jurisdictions in Federal programs.

#### § § 381.186

        Under the “Talmadge-Aiken Act” of September 28, 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450), the Administrator is authorized under stated conditions to utilize employees and facilities of any State in carrying out Federal functions under the Poultry Products Inspection Act. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a Federal-State program. Under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Administrator is also authorized to conduct examinations, investigations, and inspections under the Act through any officer or employee of any State or territory or the District of Columbia commissioned by him for such purpose.

        § 381.187   Cooperation of States for the interstate shipment of poultry products.

#### § § 381.187

        (a) The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 472(b) to coordinate with States that have poultry products inspection programs as provided in § 381.185 of this subpart to select certain establishments operating under these programs to participate in a cooperative program to ship poultry products in interstate commerce. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”

        (b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the poultry products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs. Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services to selected establishments in the State.

        (c) Subpart Z, of this part 381 prescribes conditions under which States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program.

        (d) The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.

        (b) To dead, dying, disabled or diseased poultry and specimens of undenatured, uninspected or adulterated carcasses, parts, or products of poultry thereof for educational, research, or other nonfood purposes shipped under permit issued by the inspector in charge upon his determination that collection and movement thereof will not interfere with inspection or sanitary conditions at the establishment, and the specimens are for nonfood purposes. The person desiring such specimens shall make a written application to the inspector in charge for such permit on Form MP-112 and shall obtain permission from the operator of the official establishment to obtain the specimens. Permits shall be issued for a period not longer than one year. The permit may be revoked by the inspector in charge if he determines after notice and opportunity to present views is afforded to the permittee that any such specimens were not used as stated in the application, or if the collection or handling of the specimens interferes with inspection or the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the establishment. The specimens referred to in this paragraph shall be collected and handled only at such time and place and in such manner as not to interfere with the inspection or to cause any objectionable condition and shall be identified as inedible when they leave the establishment.

        (c) To parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails and feathers in their natural state.

        (a) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce or from any official establishment, any slaughtered poultry from which the blood, feathers, feet, head, or viscera have not been removed in accordance with the regulations.

        (b)(1) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, any slaughtered poultry or other poultry product which is capable of use as human food and is adulterated or fails to bear an official inspection legend or is otherwise misbranded at the time of such sale, transportation, offer or receipt, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) and subpart C or T.

        (2)(i) Poultry heads and feet that are collected and handled at an official establishment in an acceptable manner may be shipped from the official establishment directly for export as human food, if they have been examined and found to be suitable for such purpose, by an inspector and are labeled as prescribed in this paragraph.

        (ii) The containers of all such products shall bear a label showing: (A) The name of the products; (B) the name and address of the packer or distributor, and, when the name of the distributor is shown, it shall be qualified by such terms as “packed for,” “distributed by,” or “distributors”; and (C) the official establishment number of the establishment where packed.

        (3)(i) Poultry heads and feet that are collected and handled at an official establishment in an acceptable manner may be shipped from the official establishment and in commerce directly to another official establishment for processing before export, provided the receiving establishment maintains records that:

        (A) Identify the source of the incoming undenatured poultry product;

        (B) Identify the location of the product at all times during processing and preparation for export; and

        (C) Contain a written certification from an official of the receiving establishment that the undenatured poultry product intended for export has not been, and will not be, commingled with any product intended for consumption in the United States.

        (ii) The receiving establishment may only ship the undenatured poultry product intended for export in accordance with the inspection and labeling requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (c) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, poultry products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce or in any State designated under § 381.221, any poultry product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated. Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment. The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Inspection Service's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if poultry product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated.

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, poultry carcasses, and parts and products thereof, that are not intended for use as human food may, after they have been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95, be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, even though they do not comply with all the provisions of the regulations, provided they are marked “Not fit for human food.” These requirements do not apply to parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails.

        (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, no animal food processed, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of poultry in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation in commerce, or imported, unless:

        (i) It is properly identified as animal food;

        (ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and

        (iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95 so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.

        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of poultry and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the poultry industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95.

        (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95 if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appears on the label in a conspicuous manner.

        (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be stated in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from carcasses of poultry.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Chicken for Pets” or “Turkey Dinner for Cats”:  That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass, but shall not be less than   inch high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.

        (iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of poultry carcass-source material contrast with their background.

        (4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feed manufactured from processed poultry byproducts (such as poultry byproduct meal, hydrolyzed poultry feathers, and hydrolyzed poultry byproducts aggregate), or to processed dry animal food.

        (B) Post mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;

        (C) Official controls by the national government over establishment construction, facilities, and equipment;

        (D) Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering of poultry and processing of poultry products, by the assignment of inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to assure that adulterated or misbranded poultry products are not processed for export to the United States;

        (E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified, and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;

        (F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of poultry products;

        (G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;

        (H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.

        (I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or the regulations in this part.

        (iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of poultry products into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign poultry inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii). Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of poultry products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign poultry inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section.

        (iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those applicable to the Federal system in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:

        (A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;

        (B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (a)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of the representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign inspection official:  that such reports are not required during a period when the establishment is not operating or not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States.

        (C) Random sampling and testing at the point of slaughter of carcasses, including internal organs and fat, for residues identified by the exporting country's inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator:  that such testing is required only on samples taken of carcasses from which poultry or poultry products intended for importation into the United States are produced.

        (3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.

        (i) For a new establishment or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title; the foreign official's signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operation(s) conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).

        (ii) If the establishment information provided on the preceding year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).

        (4) Poultry products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section may not be imported into the United States, except as provided by §§ 381.207 and 381.209. Eligibility of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn whenever the Administrator determines that the system of poultry inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure compliance with requirements equivalent to all the requirements of the Act and the regulations as applied to official establishments in the United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates required under this subpart from authorities of such foreign country; or that, for lack of current information concerning the system of poultry inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign country should be required to reestablish its eligibility.

        (b) A list of countries eligible to export specific process categories of poultry products to the United States is maintained at  Such products from listed countries must be accompanied by inspection certificates of the country of origin, as required by § 381.197, and are eligible under the regulations in this subpart for entry into the United States, after inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this subpart.

        (2) Every lot of product shall routinely be given visual inspection for appearance and condition, and checked for certification and label compliance.

        (3) The electronic inspection system shall be consulted for reinspection instructions. The electronic inspection system will assign reinspection levels and procedures based on established sampling plans and established product and plant history.

        (4) When the inspector deems it necessary, the inspector may sample and inspect lots not designated by the electronic inspection system.

        (b) Inspectors may take, without cost to the United States, from each consignment of poultry products offered for entry, such samples of the products as are deemed necessary to determine the eligibility of the products for entry into the commerce of the United States.

        (c) Poultry products imported under § 381.207 shall not be sampled and inspected under this section unless there is reason for suspecting the presence therein of a substance in violation of that section, and in such case they shall be sampled and inspected in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) In addition to the provisions specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the following requirements apply to imported canned product.

        (1) Imported canned products are required to be sound, healthful, properly labeled, wholesome, and otherwise not adulterated at the time the products are offered for importation into the United States. Provided other requirements of this part are met, the determination of the acceptability of the product and the condition of the containers shall be based on the results of an examination of a statistical sample drawn from the consignment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. If the inspector determines, on the basis of the sample examination, that the product does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the consignment shall be refused entry. However, a consignment rejected for container defects but otherwise acceptable may be reoffered for inspection under the following conditions:

        (i) If the defective containers are not indicative of an unsafe or unstable product as determined by the Administrator;

        (ii) If the number and kinds of container defects found in the original sample do not exceed the limits specified for this purpose in FSIS guidelines; and

        (iii) If the defective containers in the consignment have been sorted out and exported or destroyed under the supervision of an inspector.

        (2) Representative samples of _c_anned product designated by the Administrator in instructions to inspectors shall be incubated under the supervision of such inspectors in accordance with § 381.309 (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv)(), (d)(1)(v), (d)(1)(vii), and (d)(1)(viii) of this subchapter.

        (e) All products, required by this part to be inspected, shall be inspected only at an official establishment or at an official import inspection establishment approved by the Administrator as provided in this section. Such approved official import inspection establishments will be listed in the Meat, Poultry and Egg Product Inspection Directory, published by the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The listing will categorize the kind or kinds of product which may be inspected at each official import inspection establishment, based on the adequacy of the facilities for making such inspections and handling such products in a sanitary manner.

        (f) Owners or operators of establishments, other than official establishments, who want to have import inspections made at their establishments, shall apply to the Administrator for approval of their establishments for such purpose. Application shall be made on a form furnished by the Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, and shall include all information called for by that form.

        (g) Approval for Federal import inspection shall be in accordance with subpart D of this part.

        (i) The Administrator is authorized to approve any establishment as an official import inspection establishment provided that an application has been filed and drawings have been submitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and he determines that such establishment meets the requirements under paragraph (e) of this section. Any application for inspection under this section may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.

        (j) Approval of an official import inspection establishment may be withdrawn in accordance with applicable rules of practice if it is determined that the sanitary conditions are such that the product is rendered adulterated, that such action is authorized by section 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (84 Stat. 91), or that the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section were not complied with. Approval may also be withdrawn in accordance with section 401 of the Act and applicable rules of practice.

        (k) A special official number shall be assigned to each official import inspection establishment. Such number shall be used to identify all products inspected and passed for entry at the establishment.

        § 381.202   Poultry products offered for entry; reporting of findings to customs; handling of articles refused entry; appeals, how made; denaturing procedures.

#### § § 381.202

        (a)(1) Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry.

        (2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry,” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (3) No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided during disposition pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States without the expressed consent of the Administrator, based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product identified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 381.198.

        (4) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.

        (5) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Department will take such actions as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expenses in the appropriate forum.

        (6) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 19 of the Act, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 20 of the Act.

        (b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under this subpart and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any request not to comply with the requirements in this subpart.

        (c) Except as provided in § 381.200(a) or (b), no person shall remove or cause to be removed from any place designated as the place of inspection, any poultry product which the regulations in this subpart require to be marked in any way, unless the same has been clearly and legibly marked in compliance with this subpart.

        (d) Any person receiving inspection service may, if dissatisfied with any decision or action of an inspector or other Agency employee relating to any inspection, file an appeal from such decision or action in accordance with 9 CFR 500.9. The poultry or poultry products involved in any appeal must be identified by U.S. retained tags and segregated in a manner approved by the inspector or other Agency employee pending completion of an appeal inspection.

        (e) All condemned carcasses, or condemned parts of carcasses, or other condemned poultry products, except those condemned for biological residues, shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service. (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishments.)

        (1) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle or vat, a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. (Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection by means of pipes, or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.)

        (2) Incineration or complete destruction by burning.

        (3) Chemical denaturing, which shall be accomplished by the liberal application to all carcasses and parts thereof, of:

        (i) Crude carbolic acid,

        (ii) Kerosene, fuel oil, or used crankcase oil, or

        (iii) Any phenolic disinfectant conforming to commercial standards CS 70-41 or CS 71-41 which shall be used in at least 2 percent emulsion or solution.

        (4) Any other substances or method that the Administrator approves in specific cases, which will denature the poultry product to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.

        (5) Carcasses and parts of carcasses condemned for biological residue shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section or by burying under the supervision of an inspector.

        (f) The inspection legend may be placed on containers of product before completion of official import inspection if the containers are being inspected by an import inspector who reports to an Import Field Office Supervisor, the product is not required to be held at the establishment pending the receipt of laboratory test results; and a written procedure for controlled stamping, submitted by the import establishment and approved by the Director, Import Inspection Division, is on file at the import inspection facility where the inspection is to be performed.

        (1) The written procedure for controlled pre-stamping should be in the form of a letter and shall include the following:

        (i) That stamping under this subpart will be limited to those lots of product which can be inspected on the day that certificates for the product are examined;

        (ii) That all products which have been pre-stamped will be stored in the facility where the import inspection will occur;

        (iii) That inspection marks applied under this part will be removed from any lot of product subsequently refused entry on the day the product is rejected; and

        (iv) That the establishment will maintain a daily stamping log containing the following information for each lot of product: the date of inspection, the country of origin, the foreign establishment number, the product name, the number of units, the shipping container marks, and the MP-410 number covering the product to be inspected. The daily stamping log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with the requirements of § 381.177.

        (2) An official import establishment's controlled pre-stamping privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector or other Agency employee who is supervising its enforcement whenever the employee finds that the official import establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision or action and the reasons therefor will be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision or action in accordance with 9 CFR 500.9. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the controlled pre-stamping privilege was wrongfully cancelled.

#### § § 381.222

        The provisions of the regulations in this part apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 381.221 under paragraph 5(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)

        (a) Each establishment located in such a designated State, shall be granted inspection required under § 381.6(b) only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.

        (b) Section 381.26 will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 381.6(b), except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments or between official establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible poultry product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of the regulations. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible poultry product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations.

        (c) Sections 381.49 and 381.51 shall apply to such establishments, except that separate facilities for men and women workers will not be required when the majority of the workers in the establishment are related by blood or marriage, provided that this will not conflict with municipal or State requirements; and except that separation of toilet soil lines from house drainage lines to a point outside the buildings will not be required in existing construction when positive acting backflow devices are installed.

        (d) Subpart N of this part shall apply to such establishments except as provided in this paragraph (d).

        (1) The operator of each such establishment shall, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under § 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 4(h) of the Act.

        (2) The Front Line Supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.

        (3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff at headquarters, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by § 412.1 or their use must be discontinued.

        (4) The Front Line Supervisor will also review all shipping containers to ensure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of pressure sensitive tape of a type that cannot be removed without visible evidence of such removal, or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of the regulations must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.

        (e) Sections 381.175 through 381.179 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 5(c) only if the State is also designated under section 11 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 381.224.

        (f) Section 381.185(a) will not apply to States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act.

        (g) Provisions of this part relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.

        § 381.225   Criteria and procedure for designating establishments with operations which would clearly endanger the public health; disposition of poultry products therein.

#### § § 381.225

        (a) An establishment in any State not listed in § 381.221 that is preparing poultry products solely for distribution within such State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:

        (1) Any poultry product processed at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:

        (i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of section 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or

        (ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from a poultry carcass or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics); or it is, or was prepared from, a poultry carcass which would be required to be condemned under subpart K at official establishments; or

        (iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example, if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishment, or insanitary water is used in preparing poultry products for human food); or

        (iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter; or

        (v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and

        (2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.

        (b) When any such establishment is identified by an inspector as one producing adulterated poultry products which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:

        (1) The inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Inspection Service. When it is determined by the Regional Director that any establishment preparing poultry products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated poultry products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated poultry products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.

        (2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him 10 days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of sections 1 through 4, 6 through 10, and 12 through 22 of the Act as though engaged in commerce.

        (3) Thereafter the inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated poultry products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.

        (c) Poultry products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to retention or detention, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with § 381.145 or subpart U of this part:  That poultry products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.

        (d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any poultry products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 381.10 of this subpart. All other provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if they were engaged in commerce, except that the exceptions provided for in § 381.222 shall apply to such establishments.

#### § §§ 381.403-381.407

        § 381.408   Labeling of poultry products with number of servings.

#### § § 381.408

        The label of any package of a poultry product that bears a representation as to the number of servings contained in such package shall meet the requirements of § 381.121(c)(7).

        § 381.409   Nutrition label content.

#### § § 381.409

        (a) All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.

        (b)(1) The term “serving” or “serving size” means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, the serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion—General Food Supply” (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in § 381.412(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ______ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the Reference Amounts in § 381.412(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition claims.

        (3) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of the product “as packaged” for all products, except that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401 may be declared on the basis of the product “as consumed.” For single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, if data are based on the product “as consumed,” the data must be presented in accordance with § 381.445(d). In addition to the required declaration on the basis of “as packaged” for products other than single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401, the declaration may also be made on the basis of “as consumed,” provided that preparation and cooking instructions are clearly stated.

        (4) For products in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings, and individually packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size shall be declared as follows:

        (i) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.

        (ii) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size.

        (iii) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.

        (iv) If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.

        (v) For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or milliliter) or larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.

        (vi) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined in § 381.412(c).

        (vii) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.

        (5) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza, pan of poultry lasagna), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g.,   quiche,   pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product determined in § 381.412(d) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product determined in § 381.412(c). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use  ,  ,  ,  ,  , or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.

        (6) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole turkey, turkey breast, ground poultry), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., turkey breast and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in § 381.412(c).

        (7) For labeling purposes, the term “common household measure” or “common household unit” means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g.,   pizza), ounce (oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar or tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, the following rules shall be used:

        (i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in  - or  -cup increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities less than   cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp), 1, 1 , 1 , or 1  tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 teaspoon (tsp), and in  -tsp increments for quantities less than 1 tsp.

        (ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.

        (iii) If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used. Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).

        (iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., wing, slice, link, or patty).

        (v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.

        (vi) For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., chicken wings with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.

        (vii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 grams (g).

        (viii) When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp), manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.

        (8) A product that is packaged and sold individually and that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating occasion.

        (9) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.

        (i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.

        (ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.

        (iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced chicken roll. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz increments.

        (iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.

        (10) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.

        (i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).

        (ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size, the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).

        (iii) For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parenthesis following the “varied” statement (e.g., varied (approximately 8 servings per pound)).

        (iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.

        (v) For packages containing several individually packaged multi-serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multi-serving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, including those that have been previously frozen.

        (11) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and products that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.

        (12) The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(l) and § 381.413 (m) in single-serve containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 381.412(b) if the product is listed in § 381.412(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers that are not listed in § 381.412(b) will be based on the reference amount according to § 381.412(c), (d), and (e).

        (13) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information in the same format as required by § 381.409(e),

        (i) Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as packaged or purchased.

        (ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.

        (14) If a product consists of assortments of poultry products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual product.

        (15) If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)):  that the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.

        (c) The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in labeling of a poultry product shall contain information about the level of the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph. No nutrients or food components other than those listed in this paragraph as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the nutrition label. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, nutrient information shall be presented using the nutrient names specified and in the following order in the formats specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.

        (1) “Calories, total,” “Total calories,” or “Calories”: A statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero. Energy content per serving may also be expressed in kilojoule units, added in parenthesis immediately following the statement of the caloric content.

        (i) Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods. Where either specific or general food factors are used, the factors shall be applied to the actual amount (i.e., before rounding) of food components (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, protein, or ingredients with specific food factors) present per serving.

        (A) Using specific Atwater factors (i.e., the Atwater method) given in Table 13, page 25, “Energy Value of Foods—Basis and Derivation,” by A. L. Merrill and B. K.

When the protein in products represented or purported to be for adults and children 4 or more years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 20 expressed as a percent, or when the protein in a product represented or purported to be for children greater than 1 but less than 4 years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 40 expressed as a percent, either of the following shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content by weight: The statement “not a significant source of protein,” or a listing aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value” of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or Reference Daily Intake (RDI), as appropriate, for protein and expressed as percent of Daily Value. When the protein quality in a product as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a product represented or purported to be for infants, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor of 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by appropriate methods of analysis in accordance with § 381.409(h), except when the procedure for a specific food requires another factor.

        (i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be for infants or children under 4 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it shall be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the product is represented or purported to be for infants and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.

        (ii) The corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving for products represented or purported to be for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 in “Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” Rome, 1990, which is incorporated by reference. Sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 of the “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” as published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization, is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. It is available for inspection at the office of the FSIS Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  Copies of the incorporation by reference are available from the Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 329, West End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700. For products represented or purported to be for infants, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject product's protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.

        (iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and the RDI for protein for children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women shall be 16 grams, 14 grams, 60 grams, and 65 grams, respectively.

        (8) Vitamins and minerals: A statement of the amount per serving of the vitamins and minerals as described in this paragraph, calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as percent of Daily Value.

        (i) For purposes of declaration of percent of Daily Value as provided for in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, products represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women shall use the RDI's that are specified for the intended group. For products represented or purported to be for use by both infants and children under 4 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants from birth to 12 months of age and for children under 4 years of age. Similarly, the percent of Daily Value based on both the RDI values for pregnant women and for lactating women shall be declared separately on products represented or purported to be for use by both pregnant and lactating women. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. All other products shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.

        (ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a percent of the RDI shall include vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, in that order, and shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added, or when a claim is made about them. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or in labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:

        (A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another product; or

        (B) Included in a product solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredients statement. The declaration may also include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are naturally occurring in the food. The additional vitamins and minerals shall be listed in the order established in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section.

        (iii) The percentages for vitamins and minerals shall be expressed to the nearest 2-percent increment up to and including the 10-percent level, the nearest 5-percent increment above 10 percent and up to and including the 50-percent level, and the nearest 10-percent increment above the 50-percent level. Amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared in nutrition labeling but may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).” Alternatively, if vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, or iron is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement “Not a significant source of ________ (listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)” is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values.

        (iv) The following RDI's and nomenclature are established for the following vitamins and minerals which are essential in human nutrition:

        (v) The following synonyms may be added in parenthesis immediately following the name of the nutrient or dietary component:

        (vi) A statement of the percent of vitamin A that is present as -carotene may be declared voluntarily. When the vitamins and minerals are listed in a single column, the statement shall be indented under the information on vitamin A. When vitamins and minerals are arrayed horizontally, the statement of percent shall be presented in parenthesis following the declaration of vitamin A and the percent of Daily Value of vitamin A in the product (e.g., “Percent Daily Value: Vitamin A 50 (90 percent as -carotene)”). When declared, the percentages shall be expressed in the same increments as are provided for vitamins and minerals in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section.

        (9) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV, the following DRV's are established for the following food components based on the reference caloric intake of 2,000 calories:

        (d)(1) Nutrient information specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be presented on products in the following format, except on products on which dual columns of nutrition information are declared as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, on those products on which the simplified format is permitted to be used as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, on products for infants and children less than 4 years of age as provided for in § 381.500(c), and on products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (i) The nutrition information shall be set off in a box by use of hairlines and shall be all black or one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical.

        (ii) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize:

        (A) A single easy-to-read type style,

        (B) Upper and lower case letters,

        (C) At least one point leading (i.e., space between two lines of text) except that at least four points leading shall be utilized for the information required by paragraphs (d)(7) and (d)(8) of this section, and

        (D) Letters should never touch.

        (iii) Information required in paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(5), (d)(7), and (d)(8) of this section shall be in type size no smaller than 8 point. Except for the heading “Nutrition Facts,” the information required in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(6), and (d)(9) of this section and all other information contained within the nutrition label shall be in type size no smaller than 6 point. When provided, the information described in paragraph (d)(10) of this section shall also be in type no smaller than 6 point.

        (iv) The headings required by paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(4), and (d)(6) of this section (i.e., “Nutrition Facts,” “Amount Per Serving,” and “% Daily Value*”), the names of all nutrients that are not indented according to requirements of paragraph (c) of this section (i.e., Calories, Total fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Potassium, Total carbohydrate, and Protein), and the percentage amounts required by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section shall be highlighted by bold or extra bold type or other highlighting (reverse printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) that prominently distinguishes it from other information. No other information shall be highlighted.

        (v) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate “Amount Per Serving” from the calorie statements required in paragraph (d)(5) of this section and shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent of Daily Value required in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) and (d)(7)(ii) of this section from the nutrient and percent of Daily Value above and below it.

        (2) The information shall be presented under the identifying heading of “Nutrition Facts” which shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, except for labels presented according to the format provided for in paragraph (d)(11) of this section, unless impractical, shall be set the full width of the information provided under paragraph (d)(7) of this section.

        (3) Information on serving size shall immediately follow the heading. Such information shall include:

        (i) “Serving Size”: A statement of the serving size as specified in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.

        (ii) “Servings Per Container”: The number of servings per container, except that this statement is not required on single-serving containers as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section or on single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401.

        (4) A subheading “Amount Per Serving” shall be separated from serving size information by a bar.

        (5) Information on calories shall immediately follow the heading “Amount Per Serving” and shall be declared in one line, leaving sufficient space between the declaration of “Calories” and “Calories from fat” to allow clear differentiation, or, if “Calories from saturated fat” is declared, in a column with total “Calories” at the top, followed by “Calories from fat” (indented), and “Calories from saturated fat” (indented).

        (6) The column heading “% Daily Value,” followed by an asterisk (e.g., “% Daily Value*”), shall be separated from information on calories by a bar. The position of this column heading shall allow for a list of nutrient names and amounts as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section to be to the left of, and below, this column heading. The column heading “Percent Daily Value,” “Percent DV,” or “% DV” may be substituted for “% Daily Value.”

        (7) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, and except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2), nutrient information for both mandatory and any voluntary nutrients listed in paragraph (c) of this section that are to be declared in the nutrition label, except vitamins and minerals, shall be declared as follows:

        (i) The name of each nutrient, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be given in a column and followed immediately by the quantitative amount by weight for that nutrient appended with a “g” for grams or “mg” for milligrams.

        (ii) A listing of the percent of the DRV as established in paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (c)(9) of this section shall be given in a column aligned under the heading “% Daily Value” established in paragraph (d)(6) of this section with the percent expressed to the nearest whole percent for each nutrient declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section for which a DRV has been established, except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The percent shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the DRV for the nutrient, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).

        (8) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and shall be arrayed horizontally (e.g., Vitamin A 4%, Vitamin C 2%, Calcium 15%, Iron 4%) or may be listed in two columns, except that when more than four vitamins and minerals are declared, they may be declared vertically with percentages listed under the column headed “% Daily Value.”

        (9) A footnote, preceded by an asterisk, shall be placed beneath the list of vitamins and minerals and shall be separated from that list by a hairline.

        (i) The footnote shall state: Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.

        (ii) If the percent of Daily Value is given for protein in the Percent of Daily Value column as provided in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, protein shall be listed under dietary fiber, and a value of 50 g shall be inserted on the same line in the column headed “2,000” and value of 65 g in the column headed “2,500.”

        (iii) If potassium is declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, potassium shall be listed under sodium and the DRV established in paragraph (c)(9) of this section shall be inserted on the same line in the numeric columns.

        (iv) The abbreviations established in paragraph (g)(2) of this section may be used within the footnote.

        (10) Caloric conversion information on a per-gram basis for fat, carbohydrate, and protein may be presented beneath the information required in paragraph (d)(9), separated from that information by a hairline. This information may be presented horizontally (i.e., “Calories per gram: Fat 9, Carbohydrate 4, Protein 4”) or vertically in columns.

        (11)(i) If the space beneath the information on vitamins and minerals is not adequate to accommodate the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the information required in paragraph (d)(9) may be moved to the right of the column required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.

        (ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of iron is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.

        (iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (i.e., approximately 3 inches) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of iron, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display in which the footnote required by paragraph (d)(9) of the section is given to the far right of the label, and additional vitamins and minerals beyond the four that are required (i.e., vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) are arrayed horizontally following declarations of the required vitamins and minerals.

        (12) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:

        (13)(i) Nutrition labeling on the outer label of packages of poultry products that contain two or more products in the same packages (e.g., variety packs) or of packages that are used interchangeably for the same type of food (e.g., poultry salad containers) may use an aggregate display.

        (ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with format requirements of paragraph (d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” title, and both the quantitative amount by weight (i.e., g/mg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food.

        (14) When nutrition labeling appears in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.

        (e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same product (e.g., both “raw” and “cooked”) or for common combinations of foods as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for different units (e.g., per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDI's are established (e.g., both infants and children less than 4 years of age) as provided for in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:

        (1) Following the subheading of “Amount Per Serving,” there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the forms of the same product (e.g., “raw” and “roasted”), the combinations of foods, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared. The column representing the product as packaged and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) shall be to the left of the numeric columns.

        (2) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same product, for combinations of foods, or for different units, total calories and calories from fat (and calories from saturated fat, when declared) shall be listed in a column and indented as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section with quantitative amounts declared in columns aligned under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (3) Quantitative information by weight required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall be specified for the form of the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b).

        (i) Quantitative information by weight may be included for other forms of the product represented by the additional column(s) either immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information by weight for the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) or as a footnote.

        (A) If such additional quantitative information is given immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information, it shall be declared for all nutrients listed and placed immediately following and differentiated from the required quantitative information (e.g., separated by a comma). Such information shall not be put in a separate column.

        (B) If such additional quantitative information is given in a footnote, it shall be declared in the same order as the nutrients are listed in the nutrition label. The additional quantitative information may state the total nutrient content of the product identified in the second column or the nutrient amounts added to the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, for only those nutrients that are present in different amounts than the amounts declared in the required quantitative information. The footnote shall clearly identify which amounts are declared. Any subcomponents declared shall be listed parenthetically after principal components (e.g.,   cup skim milk contributes an additional 40 calories, 65 mg sodium, 6 g total carbohydrate (6 g sugars), and 4 g protein).

        (ii) Total fat and its quantitative amount by weight shall be followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) (e.g., “Total fat (2 g)*”) referring to another asterisk (or symbol) at the bottom of the nutrition label identifying the form(s) of the product for which quantitative information is presented.

        (4) Information required in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(8) of this section shall be presented under the subheading “% DAILY VALUE” and in columns directly under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:

        (f)(1) Nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as set forth herein when any required nutrients, other than the core nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein), are present in insignificant amounts. An insignificant amount shall be defined as that amount that may be rounded to zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars and protein, it shall be an amount less than 1 gram.

        (2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:

        (i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, sodium, and protein;

        (ii) Any of the following that are present in more than insignificant amounts: Calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron; and

        (iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added in fortified or fabricated foods.

        (3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the product in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.

        (4) Any required nutrient, other than a core nutrient, that is present in an insignificant amount may be omitted from the tabular listing, provided that the following statement is included at the bottom of the nutrition label, “Not a significant source of ________.” The blank shall be filled in with the appropriate nutrient or food component. Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).”

        (5) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in § 381.500(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”

        (g) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and § 381.402(a) by one or more of the following means:

        (1)(i) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular display.

        (ii) When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding is required only on the title “Nutrition Facts” and is allowed for nutrient names for “Calories,” “Total fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Sodium,” “Total carbohydrate,” and “Protein.”

        (2) Using any of the following abbreviations:

        (3) Omitting the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section and placing another asterisk at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”

        (4) Presenting the required information on any other label panel.

        (h) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:

        (1) A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, constitutes a production lot.

        (2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot. Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the “Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,” or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the “Official Methods of Analysis” of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a particular method of analysis is specified in § 381.409(c), or, if no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by the Agency. The “Official Methods of Analysis” is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be purchased from the AOAC International, 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201. It is also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

        (3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:

        (i) Class I. Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and

        (ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. If any ingredient which contains a naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrient is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to Class II requirements unless the same nutrient is also added, which would make the total amount of such nutrient subject to Class I requirements.

        (4) A product with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 4(h) of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)) unless it meets the following requirements:

        (i) Class I vitamin, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.

        (ii) Class II vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;  That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls below this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.

        (5) A product with a label declaration of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 4(h) of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)) if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;  That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls above this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.

        (6) The amount of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium may vary over labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice. The amount of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium may vary under labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice.

        (7) Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the label statement of serving size.

        (8) The management of the establishment must maintain records to support the validity of nutrient declarations contained on product labels. Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any duly authorized representative of the Agency upon request.

        (9) The compliance provisions set forth in paragraph (h)(1) through (8) of this section shall not apply to single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, including those that have been previously frozen, when nutrition labeling is based on the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, as provided in § 381.445(e) and (f).

        §§ 381.410-381.411   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 381.410-381.411

        § 381.412   Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.

#### § § 381.412

        (a) The general principles followed in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)), as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:

        (1) The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.

        (2) The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.

        (3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.

        (4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion were considered.

        (5) When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:

        (i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;

        (ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;

        (iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and

        (iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.

        (6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the Reference Amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.

        (7) The Reference Amount is based on the major intended use of the product (e.g., a mixed dish measurable with a cup as a main dish and not as a side dish).

        (8) The Reference Amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other products, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., ground poultry), are based on use in the form purchased.

        (9) FSIS sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform Reference Amount.

        (b) The following Product Categories and Reference Amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:

        (c) For products that have no Reference Amount listed in paragraph (b) of this section for the unprepared or the prepared form of the product and that consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., poultry lunch meat with cheese and crackers), the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be determined using the following rules:

        (1) For bulk products, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be the Reference Amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.

        (2) For products where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is one or more discrete units, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be either the number of small discrete units or the fraction of the large discrete unit that is represented as the main ingredient that is closest to the Reference Amount for that ingredient as established in paragraph (b) of this section plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.

        (3) If the Reference Amounts are in compatible units, they shall be summed (e.g., ingredients in equal volumes such as tablespoons). If the Reference Amounts are in incompatible units, the weights of the appropriate volumes should be used (e.g., grams of one ingredient plus gram weight of tablespoons of a second ingredient).

        (d) If a product requires further preparation, e.g., cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a Reference Amount for the product in the prepared form, then the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be determined using the following rules:

        (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) For products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare one large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the fraction of the large discrete unit closest to the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (e) The Reference Amount for an imitation or substitute product or altered product as defined in § 381.413(d), such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the same as for the product for which it is offered as a substitute.

        (f) The Reference Amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutritional claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the Reference Amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the Reference Amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the Reference Amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parenthesis, by the amount in common household measure if the Reference Amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures.

        (g) The Administrator, on his or her own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a labeling application, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a Product Category or Reference Amount identified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.

        (2) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.

        (3) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.

        (4) Data accompanying the labeling application, such as food consumption data, shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.

        (5) The labeling application must be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.

        (6) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application, that to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her pertinent to the evaluation of the labeling application.

        (7) Labeling applications for a new Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be accompanied by the following data which shall be submitted in the following form to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, DC 20250:

        (8) Upon receipt of the labeling application and supporting documentation, the applicant shall be notified, in writing, of the date on which the labeling application was received. Such notice shall inform the applicant that the labeling application is undergoing Agency review and that the applicant shall subsequently be notified of the Agency's decision to consider for further review or deny the labeling application.

        (9) Upon review of the labeling application and supporting documentation, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the labeling application is either being considered for further review or that it has been summarily denied by the Administrator.

        (10) If the labeling application is summarily denied by the Administrator, the written notification shall state the reasons therefor, including why the Agency has determined that the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category is false or misleading. The notification letter shall inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        (i) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.

        (ii) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

        (11) If the labeling application is not summarily denied by the Administrator, the Administrator shall publish in the  a proposed rule to amend the regulations to authorize the use of the Reference Amount and/or Product Category. The proposal shall also summarize the labeling application, including where the supporting documentation can be reviewed. The Administrator's proposed rule shall seek comment from consumers, the industry, consumer and industry groups, and other interested persons on the labeling application and the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category. After public comment has been received and reviewed by the Agency, the Administrator shall make a determination on whether the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be approved for use on the labeling of poultry products.

        (i) If the Reference Amount and/or Product Category is denied by the Administrator, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the basis for the denial, including the reason why the Reference Amount and/or Product Category on the labeling was determined by the Agency to be false or misleading. The notification letter shall also inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        (A) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.

        (B) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

        (ii) If the Reference Amount and/or Product Category is approved, the Agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, and shall also publish in the  a final rule amending the regulations to authorize the use of the Reference Amount and/or Product Category.

        § 381.413   Nutrient content claims; general principles.

#### § § 381.413

        (a) This section applies to poultry products that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale.

        (b) A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling pursuant to § 381.409, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.

        (1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”

        (2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:

        (i) Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or

        (ii) Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).

        (3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in subpart Y of this part.

        (4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).

        (c) Information that is required or permitted by § 381.409 to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.

        (d) A “substitute” product is one that may be used interchangeably with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”

        (1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).

        (2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).

        (e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a product implies that the product differs from other products of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium chicken noodle soup”).

        (2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “chicken breast meat, a low sodium food”).

        (f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.

        (g) Labeling information required in §§ 381.413, 381.454, 381.456, 381.460, 381.461, 381.462, and 381.480, whose type size is not otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less than   inch in height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).

        (h) [Reserved]

        (i) Except as provided in § 381.409 or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:

        (1) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart Y of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 10 g of fat per serving;”

        (2) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the product is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving, not a low sodium product.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2);

        (3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.

        (4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 381.462(b)(6).

        (j) A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference product. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.

        (1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this paragraph (j).

        (i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a similar product.

        (B) For “light,” “reduced,” and “added” claims, the reference product shall be a similar product, and

        (ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference product shall be representative of the type of product that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.

        (B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.

        (2) For products bearing relative claims:

        (i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g., “50 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” or “  fewer calories than ‘reference product’ ”); and

        (ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller than  -inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).

        (iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:

        (A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;

        (B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;

        (C) A claim on the information panel; or

        (D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.

        (iv) The label or labeling must also bear:

        (A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that in the reference product; and

        (B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.

        (3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient.

        (k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “modified fat ‘product’ ”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “contains 35 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.

        (l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal-type” product will be defined as a product that:

        (1) Makes a major contribution to the diet by:

        (i) Weighing at least 10 ounces per labeled serving; and

        (ii) Containing not less than three 40 gram portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:

        (A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;

        (B) Fruits and vegetables;

        (C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;

        (D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:

        (E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and

        (2) Is represented as, or is in the form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal, or entrèe. Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.

        (m) For purposes of making a claim, a “main-dish” product will be defined as a food that:

        (1) Makes a major contribution to the meal by:

        (i) Weighing at least 6 ounces per labeled serving; and

        (ii) Containing not less than 40 grams of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)Iii)(E) of this section.

        (A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;

        (B) Fruits and vegetables;

        (C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;

        (D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:

        (E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and

        (2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish (, not a beverage or a dessert). Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.

        (n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 381.409 shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.

        (o) Compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims shall be in accordance with § 381.409(h).

        (p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 381.412(b) through (e) shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 381.412(f) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 55 grams”).

        (2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size that is no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the criteria statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than 1/16-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).

        (q) The following exemptions apply:

        (1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that appear as part of a brand name that was in use prior to November 27, 1991, may continue to be used as part of that brand name, provided they are not false or misleading under section 4(h) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)).

        (2) [Reserved]

        (3) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 381.409 may be made on the label or in the labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral.

        (4) The requirements of this section do not apply to infant formulas and medical foods, as described in 21 CFR 101.13(q)(4).

        (5) [Reserved]

        (6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the name of a product that was subject to a standard of identity as of November 27, 1991, are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section whether or not they meet the definition of the descriptive term.

        (7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by FSIS. Labeling applications requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted pursuant to § 381.469.

#### § §§ 381.414-381.443

        § 381.444   Identification of major cuts of poultry products.

#### § § 381.444

        The major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products are: Whole chicken (without neck and giblets), chicken breast, chicken wing, chicken drumstick, chicken thigh, whole turkey (without necks and giblets; separate nutrient panels for white and dark meat permitted as an option), turkey breast, turkey wing, turkey drumstick, and turkey thigh.

        § 381.445   Nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped products described in § 381.401.

#### § § 381.445

        (a)(1) Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under § 381.500. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.

        (2) Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409.

        (3) A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of § 381.409 apply. However, if only nutrition information—and not a nutrition claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of § 381.409 apply, provided, however:

        (i) The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in § 381.409(c)(8)) and footnote required by § 381.409(d)(9) may be omitted; and

        (ii) The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in § 381.409(f).

        (d) The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either raw or cooked edible portions of poultry cuts with skin. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the skinless poultry meat.

        (e) Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen. These data may be composite data that reflect different classes of turkey or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific classes or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to class of poultry or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible poultry tissues present in the package.

        (f) If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under § 381.409(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.

        (g) Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.

        § 381.454   Nutrient content claims for “good source,” “high,” and “more.”

#### § § 381.454

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a claim about the level of a nutrient in a product in relation to the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV), established for that nutrient (excluding total carbohydrate) in § 381.409(c), may only be made on the label or in labeling of the product if:

        (1) The claim uses one of the terms defined in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;

        (2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 381.413; and

        (3) The product for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 381.409.

        (b)  (1) The terms “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent source of” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that the product contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.

        (2) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains a food that meets the definition of “high” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

        (ii) The label or labeling clearly identifies the food that is the subject of the claim (e.g., “the serving of broccoli in this meal is high in vitamin C”).

        (c)  (1) The terms “good source,” “contains,” or “provides” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as described in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that the product contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.

        (2) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains a food that meets the definition of “good source” in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

        (d)  (1) If a nutrient content claim is made with respect to the level of dietary fiber, i.e., that the product is high in fiber, a good source of fiber, or that the product contains “more” fiber, and the product is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 381.462(b)(2) or, in the case of a meal-type product or in a main-dish product, is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 381.462(b)(3), then the labeling shall disclose the level of total fat per labeled serving size (e.g., “contains 12 grams (g) of fat per serving”); and

        (2) The disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim and be in a type size no less than one-half the size of the claim.

        (e)  (1) A relative claim using the terms “more” and “added” may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in a product, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than ‘reference product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “fiber content of ‘reference product’ is 1 g per serving; ‘this product’ contains 4 g per serving”).

        (2) A relative claim using the terms “more” and “added” may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 ounces (oz) than does ‘reference product’ ”), and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the meal-type product or in a main-dish product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “fiber content of ‘reference product’ is 2 g per 3 oz; ‘this product’ contains 5 g per 3 oz”).

        § 381.456   Nutrient content claims for “light” or “lite.”

#### § § 381.456

        (a)  A claim using the terms “light” or “lite” to describe a product may only be made on the label or in labeling of the product if:

        (1) The claim uses one of the terms defined in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;

        (2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 381.413; and

        (3) The product for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 381.409.

        (b)  The terms “light” or “lite” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), without further qualification, provided that:

        (1) If the product derives 50 percent or more of its calories from fat, its fat content is reduced by 50 percent or more per reference amount customarily consumed compared to an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); or

        (2) If the product derives less than 50 percent of its calories from fat:

        (i) The number of calories is reduced by at least one-third (33  percent) per reference amount customarily consumed compared to an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); or

        (ii) Its fat content is reduced by 50 percent or more per reference amount customarily consumed compared to the appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (i) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the calories and the fat were reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “  fewer calories and 50 percent less fat than the market leader”); and

        (ii) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories and fat content in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “lite ‘this product’—200 calories, 4 grams (g) fat; regular ‘reference product’—300 calories, 8 g fat per serving”); and

        (iii) If the labeled product contains less than 40 calories or less than 3 g fat per reference amount customarily consumed, the percentage reduction for that nutrient need not be declared.

        (4) A “light” claim may not be made on a product for which the reference product meets the definition of “low fat” and “low calorie.”

        (c)(1)(i) A product for which the reference product contains 40 calories or less and 3 g fat or less per reference amount customarily consumed may use the terms “light” or “lite” without further qualification if it is reduced by 50 percent or more in sodium content compared to the reference product; and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium per labeled serving size with that of the reference product it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “lite ‘this product’—500 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving; regular ‘reference product’—1,000 mg sodium per serving”).

        (2)(i) A product for which the reference product contains more than 40 calories or more than 3 g fat per reference amount customarily consumed may use the terms “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” if it is reduced by 50 percent or more in sodium content compared to the reference product, provided that “light” or “lite” is presented in immediate proximity with “in sodium” and the entire term is presented in uniform type size, style, color, and prominence; and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium was reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “50 percent less sodium than the market leader”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium per labeled serving size with that of the reference product it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., or “lite ‘this product’—170 mg sodium per serving; regular ‘reference product’—350 mg per serving”).

        (3) Except for meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), a “light in sodium” claim may not be made on a product for which the reference product meets the definition of “low in sodium.”

        (i) The product meets the definition of:

        (A) “Low in calories” as defined in § 381.460(b)(3); or

        (B) “Low in fat” as defined in § 381.462(b)(3); and

        (ii)(A) A statement appears on the principal display panel that explains whether “light” is used to mean “low fat,” “low calories,” or both (e.g., “Light Delight, a low fat meal”); and

        (B) The accompanying statement is no less than one-half the type size of the “light” or “lite” claim.

        (2)(i) The terms “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that the product meets the definition of “low in sodium” as defined in § 381.461(b)(5)(i); and

        (ii) “Light” or “lite” and “in sodium” are presented in uniform type size, style, color, and prominence.

        (3) The terms “light” or “lite” may be used in the brand name of a product to describe the sodium content, provided that:

        (i) The product is reduced by 50 percent or more in sodium content compared to the reference product;

        (ii) A statement specifically stating that the product is “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” appears:

        (A) Contiguous to the brand name; and

        (B) In uniform type size, style, color, and prominence as the product name; and

        (iii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium was reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim; and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium per labeled serving size with that of the reference product it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.

        (e) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the terms “light” or “lite” may not be used to refer to a product that is not reduced in fat by 50 percent, or, if applicable, in calories by   or, when properly qualified, in sodium by 50 percent unless:

        (1) It describes some physical or organoleptic attribute of the product such as texture or color and the information (e.g., “light in color” or “light in texture”) so stated, clearly conveys the nature of the product; and

        (2) The attribute (e.g., “color” or “texture”) is in the same style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word “light” and in immediate proximity thereto.

        (f) If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word “light” has been associated, through common use, with a particular product to reflect a physical or organoleptic attribute to the point where it has become part of the statement of identity, such use of the term “light” shall not be considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this part.

        (g) The term “lightly salted” may be used on a product to which has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1)(i)(B) and (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not “low in sodium” as defined in § 381.461(b)(4), the statement “not a low sodium food,” shall appear adjacent to the nutrition information and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear on the label or labeling as specified in § 381.413(j)(2).

        (2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 381.413; and

        (3) The product for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 381.409.

        (b)  (1) The terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “no calories,” “zero calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietarily insignificant source of calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, provided that:

        (i) The product contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size; and

        (ii) If the product meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the caloric content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

        (2) The terms “low calorie,” “few calories,” “contains a small amount of calories,” “low source of calories,” or “low in calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 318.413(m), provided that:

        (i)(A) The product has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 grams (g) or greater than 2 tablespoons (tbsp) and does not provide more than 40 calories per reference amount customarily consumed; or

        (ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the caloric content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

        (3) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains 120 calories or less per 100 g of product; and

        (ii) If the product meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the calorie content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which it attaches.

        (4) The terms “reduced calorie,” “reduced in calories,” “calorie reduced,” “fewer calories,” “lower calorie,” or “lower in calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 318.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., lower calorie ‘product’—“33   percent fewer calories than our regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 150 to 100 calories per serving”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”

        (5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “calorie reduced ‘product’, 25% less calories per ounce (oz) (or 3 oz) than our regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 110 calories per 3 oz to 80 calories per 3 oz”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”

        (c)  (1) Terms such as “sugar free,” “free of sugar,” “no sugar,” “zero sugar,” “without sugar,” “sugarless,” “trivial source of sugar,” “negligible source of sugar,” or “dietarily insignificant source of sugar” may reasonably be expected to be regarded by consumers as terms that represent that the product contains no sugars or sweeteners, e.g., “sugar free,” or “no sugar,” as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:

        (i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 381.409(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;

        (ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: “Adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and

        (iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or

        (B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie product,” “not a low calorie product,” or “not for weight control.”

        (2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:

        (i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 381.409(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;

        (ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;

        (iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;

        (iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and

        (v) The product bears a statement that the product is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the product meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.

        (3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.

        (4) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar,” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 318.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving”).

        (5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sugar ‘product’—

        (6) The terms “reduced sodium,” “reduced in sodium,” “sodium reduced,” “less sodium,” “lower sodium,” or “lower in sodium” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sodium per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(l); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sodium ‘product’, 50 percent less sodium than regular ‘product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sodium content has been lowered from 300 to 150 mg per serving”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for “low sodium.”

        (i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sodium per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(l); and

        (ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

        (A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sodium ‘product’—30% less sodium per 3 oz than our ‘regular product’ ”); and

        (B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sodium content has been reduced from 220 mg per 3 oz to 150 mg per 3 oz”).

        (iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for “low sodium.”

        (c) The term “salt” is not synonymous with “sodium.” Salt refers to sodium chloride. However, references to salt content such as “unsalted,” “no salt,” “no salt added” are potentially misleading.

        (1) The term “salt free” may be used on the label or in labeling of products only if the product is “sodium free” as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (2) The terms “unsalted,” “without added salt,” and “no salt added” may be used on the label or in labeling of products only if:

        (i) No salt is added during processing;

        (ii) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes is normally processed with salt; and

        (iii) If the product is not sodium free, the statement “not a sodium free product” or “not for control of sodium in the diet” appears adjacent to the nutrition information of the product bearing the claim.

        (3) Paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age is unsalted, provided such statement refers to the taste of the product and is not false or otherwise misleading.

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 24756, May 2, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

        § 381.511   Definitions.

#### § § 381.511

        A cooperative poultry products inspection program described in § 381.187 of this part.

        A cooperative State-Federal poultry products inspection program described in § 381.185 of this part.

        State inspection personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act and any additional State program requirements in order to provide inspection services to selected establishments.

        “Interstate commerce” has the same meaning as “commerce” under § 381.1 of this part.

        An establishment operating under a State cooperative poultry products inspection program that has been selected by the Administrator, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program.

        § 381.512   Purpose.

        (6) Volunteers who receive no compensation are not considered employees unless their duties involve handling the poultry products prepared by the establishment.

        (7) The total number of employees can never exceed 35 individuals at any given time, regardless of the average number of employees.

        (c) The following establishments are ineligible to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program:

        § 381.514   State request for cooperative agreement.

#### § § 381.514

        (a) State participation in a cooperative interstate shipment program under this subpart is limited to States that have implemented cooperative State poultry products inspection programs.

        (b) To request an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program under this subpart, a State must submit a written request to the Administrator through the FSIS District Office for the FSIS District in which the State is located. In the request the State must:

        (1) Identify establishments in the State that have requested to be selected for the program that the State recommends for initial selection into the program, if any;

        (2) Demonstrate that the State is able to provide the necessary inspection services to selected establishments in the State and conduct any related activities that would be required under a cooperative interstate shipment program established under this subpart; and

        (3) Agree that, if the State enters into an agreement with FSIS for a cooperative interstate shipment program, the State will:

        (i) Provide FSIS with access to the results of all laboratory analyses conducted on product samples from selected establishments in the State;

        (ii) Notify the selected establishment coordinator for the State of the results of any laboratory analyses that indicate that a product prepared in a selected establishment may be adulterated or may otherwise present a food safety concern; and

        (iii) When necessary, cooperate with FSIS to transition selected establishments in the State that have been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program to become official establishments.

        (c) If the Administrator determines that a State that has submitted a request to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program qualifies to enter into a cooperative agreement for such a program, the Administrator and the State will sign a cooperative agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions under which each party will cooperate to provide inspection services to selected establishments located in the State.

        (d) After the Administrator and a State have signed an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will:

        (1) Appoint an FSIS employee as the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State and

        (2) Coordinate with the State to select establishments to participate in the program as provided in § 381.515(b) of this subpart.

        § 381.515   Establishment selection; official number for selected establishments.

#### § § 381.515

        (a) An establishment operating under a cooperative State poultry products inspection program will qualify for selection into a cooperative interstate shipment program if the establishment:

        (1) Has submitted a request to the State to be selected for the program;

        (2) Has the appropriate number of employees under § 381.513(a) of this subpart;

        (3) Is not ineligible to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program under § 381.513(c) of this subpart;

        (4) Is in compliance with all requirements under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program; and

        (b) To participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program, an establishment that meets the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section must be selected by the Administrator, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located.

        (c) If an establishment is selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State is to assign the establishment an official number that reflects the establishment's participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program and advise the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State of the official number assigned to each selected establishment in the State. The official numbers assigned to every selected establishment must contain a suffix, e.g., “SE,” that identifies the establishment as a selected establishment; that includes the letter “P,” which identifies the establishment as a poultry establishment; and that identifies the State, e.g., “SEPND,” for “selected establishment poultry North Dakota.”

        (d) Failure of a State to comply with paragraph (c) of this section will disqualify the State from participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program.

        § 381.516   Commencement of a cooperative interstate shipment program; inspection by designated personnel and official mark.

#### § § 381.516

        (a) A cooperative interstate shipment program will commence when the Administrator, in coordination with the State, has selected establishments in the State to participate in the program.

        (c) Poultry products processed in a selected establishment and inspected and passed by designated State personnel must bear an official Federal mark, stamp, tag, or label of inspection in the appropriate form prescribed in subpart M of this part that includes the information specified in § 381.515(c) of this subpart.

        (d) Poultry products processed in a selected establishment that comply with the conditions in paragraph (c) of this section may be distributed in interstate commerce.

        § 381.517   Federal oversight of a cooperative interstate shipment program.

#### § § 381.517

        (a) The FSIS selected establishment coordinator for a State that has entered into an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program will visit each selected establishment in the State on a regular basis to verify that the establishment is operating in a manner that is consistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The frequency with which the SEC will visit selected establishments under the SEC's jurisdiction will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the operations conducted at the selected establishment, the establishment's schedule of operations, and the establishment's performance under the cooperative interstate shipment program. If necessary, the selected establishment coordinator, in consultation with the District Manager that covers the State, may designate qualified FSIS personnel to visit a selected establishment on behalf of the selected establishment coordinator.

        (b) The selected establishment coordinator, in coordination with the State, will verify that selected establishments in the State are receiving the necessary inspection services from designated personnel, and that these establishments are eligible, and remain eligible, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program. The selected establishment coordinator's verification activities may include:

        (1) Verifying that each selected establishment employs, and continues to employ, 25 or fewer employees, on average, as required under § 381.513(a) of this part, unless the establishment is transitioning to become an official establishment;

        (2) Verifying that the designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter;

        (3) Verifying that that the State staffing levels for each selected establishments are appropriate to carry out the required inspection activities; and

        (4) Assessing each selected establishment's compliance with the Act and implementing regulations in this chapter.

        (c) If the selected establishment coordinator determines that designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in the State in a manner that is inconsistent with the Acts and the implementing regulations in this chapter, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for the State to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address inspection deficiencies identified by the selected establishment coordinator. If the State fails to develop a corrective action plan, or the selected establishment coordinator for the State determines that the corrective action plan is inadequate, the Administrator will terminate the agreement for the cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 381.187(d) of this part.

        § 381.518   Quarterly reports.

#### § § 381.518

        (a) The selected establishment coordinator will prepare a report on a quarterly basis that describes the status of each selected establishment under his or her jurisdiction.

        (b) The quarterly report required in paragraph (a) of this section will:

        (1) Include the selected establishment coordinator's assessment of the performance of the designated personnel in conducting inspection activities at selected establishments and

        (2) Identify those selected establishment that the selected establishment coordinator has verified are in compliance with the Act and implementing regulations in this chapter, those that have been deselected under § 381.520 of this subpart, and those that are transitioning to become official establishments under § 381.521 of this subpart.

        (c) The selected establishment coordinator is to submit the quarterly report to the Administrator through the District Manager for the State where the selected establishments identified in the report are located.

        § 381.519   Enforcement authority.

#### § § 381.519

        (a) To facilitate oversight and enforcement of this subpart, selected establishments operating under a cooperative interstate shipment program must, upon request, give the FSIS selected establishment coordinator or other FSIS officials access to all establishment records required under the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The Administrator may deselect any selected establishment that refuses to comply with this paragraph.

        (b) Selected establishment coordinators may initiate any appropriate enforcement action provided for in part 500 of this chapter if they determine that a selected establishment under their jurisdiction is operating in manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. Selected establishments participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program are subject to the notification and appeal procedures set out in part 500 of this chapter.

        (c) If inspection at a selected establishment is suspended for any of the reasons specified in § 500.3 or § 500.4 of this chapter, FSIS will:

        (1) Provide an opportunity for the establishment to implement corrective actions and remain in the cooperative interstate shipment program, or

        (2) Move to deselect the establishment as provided in § 381.520 of this subpart.

        (d) The decision to deselect a selected establishment under a suspension will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this decision, FSIS, in consultation with the State where the selected establishment is located, will consider, among other factors:

        (1) The non-compliance that led to the suspension;

        (2) The selected establishment's compliance history; and

        (3) The corrective actions proposed by the selected establishment.

        § 381.520   Deselection of ineligible establishments.

#### § § 381.520

        (a) The Administrator will deselect a selected establishment that becomes ineligible to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program for any reason listed under § 381.513(c) of this subpart.

        (b) An establishment that has been deselected must transition to become an official establishment as provided in § 381.521 of this subpart.

        § 381.521   Transition to official establishment.

#### § § 381.521

        (a) If an establishment is deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 381.520 of this subpart, FSIS, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located, will develop and implement a plan to transition the establishment to become an official establishment. Except that an establishment that was deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program because it is located in a State whose agreement for such a program was terminated may either transition to become an official establishment or transition to become a State-inspected establishment under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program.

        (b) An establishment that has been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program and successfully transitioned to become an official establishment may withdraw from the Federal inspection program and resume operations under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program after operating as an official establishment in full compliance with the Act for a year.

        § 381.522   Transition grants.

#### § § 381.522

        (a) Transition grants are funds that a State participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program under this subpart may apply for to reimburse selected establishments in the State for the cost to train one individual in the seven HACCP principles for meat or poultry processing as required under § 417.7 of this chapter and associated training in the development of sanitation standard operating procedures required under part 416 of this chapter.

        (b) A State participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program that receives a transition grant must use grant funds to reimburse the training costs of one employee per each selected establishment in the State. Any other use of such funds is prohibited.

        § 381.523   Separation of operations.

#### § § 381.523

        A selected establishment may conduct operations under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program if the establishment implements and maintains written procedures for complete physical separation of product and process for each operation by time or space.

        § 381.524   Voluntary withdrawal.

#### § § 381.524

        A selected establishment that is in full compliance with the requirements in this part may voluntarily end its participation in a cooperative interstate shipment program and operate under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program. Establishments that voluntarily end their participation in the cooperative may re-apply for the program after operating under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program for one year.

      § 390.1   Scope and purpose.

#### § § 390.1

      This part is issued pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and in accordance with the directives of the Department of Agriculture regulations in part 1, subpart A, of Title 7. The availability of records, including electronic records created on or after November 1, 1996, of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and the procedures by which the public may request such information, will be governed by the FOIA and by the Department regulations as implemented and supplemented by the regulations in this part.

      § 390.2   Published materials.

#### § § 390.2

      FSIS rules and regulations relating to its regulatory responsibilities and administrative procedures are published and made available to the public in the  and codified in chapter III, title 9, of the Code of Federal Regulations. FSIS also issues numerous publications relating to Agency programs, which implement the laws listed in the Delegation of Authority, 7 CFR 2.15(a). Most of these publications are available free from the USDA Publications Division, Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, or at established rates from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, 20402-9328.

      § 390.3   Indexes, reference guide, and handbook.

#### § § 390.3

      (a) Pursuant to the regulations in 7 CFR 1.4(c), FSIS will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying an index providing identifying information regarding the materials required to be published or made available under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). The Agency will make the index available by computer telecommunications by December 31, 1999. Quarterly publication of the index is unnecessary and impractical, since the material is voluminous and does not change often enough to justify the expense of quarterly publication. The Agency will provide copies of any index, upon request, at a cost not to exceed direct cost of duplication.

      (b) FSIS is responsible for preparing reference material or a guide for requesting records or information from the Agency. This guide also will include an index of all major information systems and a description of major information and record locator systems.

      (c) FSIS will prepare a handbook for obtaining information from the Agency. The handbook will be available on paper and through electronic means, and will discuss how the public can use it to access Agency FOIA annual reports. Similarly, the annual reports will refer to the handbook and how to obtain it.

      § 390.4   Facilities for inspection and copying.

#### § § 390.4

      Facilities for public inspection and copying of the material described in §§ 390.2 and 390.3 of this part will be provided by FSIS pursuant to 7 CFR 1.5(a) in a reading area, on business days between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., upon request to the Freedom of Information Coordinator or designee at the following address:

      § 390.5   Request for records.

#### § § 390.5

      (a) The FOIA Coordinator of FSIS is authorized to receive requests and to exercise authority under 7 CFR 1.3(a) to—

      (1) Make determinations to grant or deny such requests,

      (2) Extend the 20-day deadline,

      (3) Make discretionary releases of exempt records, except where disclosure is specifically prohibited by Executive Order, statute, and applicable regulations,

      (4) Consider expedited processing when appropriate,

      (5) Make determinations regarding the charging of fees pursuant to the established schedule, and

      (6) Determine the applicability of 7 CFR 1.5 to requests for records.

      (b) Requests for FSIS records or information will be made in writing in accordance with 7 CFR 1.5 and submitted to the FSIS Freedom of Information Act Coordinator at the following address:

      The submitter will identify each record with reasonable specificity as prescribed in 7 CFR 1.3. All requests to inspect or obtain copies of any record or to obtain a fee waiver must be submitted in writing.

      (c) In exercising authority under 7 CFR 1.3(a)(3) to grant and deny requests, the Coordinator or designee will comply with subsection (b) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), as amended, which requires that any reasonably segregated portion of a document will be provided to a person requesting the document after deletion of any portions within the scope of the request for which an exemption is being claimed under the Act. Therefore, unless the disclosable and nondisclosable portions are so inextricably linked that it is not reasonably possible to separate them, the document will be released with the nondisclosable portions deleted. The Coordinator or designee may exercise discretion as limited by 7 CFR l.15 to release the entire document or make only a minimum number of deletions. If portions of a document in electronic format have been redacted, the Agency must indicate, on the released portion of the document, the amount of information that has been deleted from a record, unless that indication would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

      § 390.6   Fee schedule.

#### § § 390.6

      Department regulations provide for a schedule of reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication. See 7 CFR 1.17. Fees to be charged are in 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, appendix A.

      § 390.7   Appeals.

#### § § 390.7

      (a) If the request for information or for a waiver of search or duplication is denied, in whole or in part, the FOIA Coordinator or designee will explain in the letter of response the grounds for any denial of access and offer the requester an opportunity to file an administrative appeal, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.3(a)(4). The appeal should be filed in writing within 45 days of the date of denial (departmental regulations, 7 CFR 1.14) and addressed as follows:

      (b) The FSIS Administrator is authorized under 7 CFR 1.3(a)(4) to extend the 20-day deadline, make discretionary releases, and make determinations regarding the charging of fees.

      (b) If requests for records and information are received by field offices, the field office will immediately notify the FOIA Coordinator or designee by telephone and transmit the request to the FOIA office. In rare instances, the FOIA Coordinator or designee will authorize a release of the requested records to the field office receiving the request. The request will be considered as having been received on the date of arrival in the office of the Coordinator or designee. Any person whose request for records has been granted may inspect and copy the records (or copies) at the office listed in § 390.4 of this part in accordance with the provisions of that section and with § 390.6. Copies also may be obtained by mail.

      § 390.9   Communications with State and other Federal government agencies.

#### § § 390.9

      (a) The Administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), or designee, may authorize the disclosure of distribution lists (records that show where and when product was shipped) obtained from a firm recalling products, or incorporated into agency-prepared records, to State and other Federal government agencies to verify the removal of the recalled product, provided that:

      (1) The State agency has provided both a written statement establishing its authority to protect confidential distribution lists from public disclosure and a written commitment not to disclose any information provided by FSIS, without the written permission of the submitter of the information or written confirmation by FSIS that the information no longer has confidential status. Federal government agencies must provide a written commitment not to disclose the information and to refer any request for distribution lists to FSIS for response; and

      (2) The Administrator of FSIS or designee determines that disclosure would be in the interest of public health.

      (b) This provision does not authorize the disclosure to State or other Federal government agencies of trade secret information, unless otherwise provided by law or pursuant to an express written authorization provided by the submitter of the information.

      (c) Information disclosed under this section is not a disclosure of information to the public. Disclosures made under this section do not waive any FOIA exemption protection.

      § 390.10   Availability of Lists of Retail Consignees during Meat or Poultry Product Recalls.

#### § § 390.10

      The Administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service will make publicly available the names and locations of retail consignees of recalled meat or poultry products that the Agency compiles in connection with a recall where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product could cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

> [73 FR 40948, July 17, 2008]

      § 390.11   FSIS systems of records exempt from the Privacy Act.

#### § § 390.11

      (a) USDA/FSIS-0005, AssuranceNet system of records, is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G)-(I), and (f) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, to the extent it contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

      (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation. This would permit record subjects to impede the investigation,  destroy evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.

      (2) From subsection (d)(1) because the records contained in this system relate to official Federal investigations and matters of law enforcement. Individual access to these records might compromise ongoing or impending investigations, reveal confidential informants, or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation.

      (3) From section (d)(2) because amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

      (4) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from subsections (d)(1) and (2).

      (5) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine in advance if investigatory information contained in this system is accurate, relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads. Moreover, it would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of all information obtained.

      (6) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) since an exemption being claimed for subsection (d) makes these subsections inapplicable.

      (7) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the categories of sources of the records in this system have been published in the  in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) requires. In the event, however, that subsection (e)(4)(I) should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in the system, exemption from this provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of enforcement information and of witnesses and informants.

      (8) From subsection (f) to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.

      (b) [Reserved]

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 66838, Nov. 7, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 412.1   Label approval.

#### § § 412.1

      (a) No final label may be used on any product unless the label has been submitted for approval to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by FSIS Form 7234-1, Application for Approval of Labels, Marking, and Devices, and approved by such staff, except for generically approved labels authorized for use in § 412.2. The management of the official establishment or establishment certified under a foreign inspection system, in accordance with parts 327 and 381, subpart T, must maintain a copy of all labels used, in accordance with parts 320 and 381, subpart Q, of this chapter. Such records must be made available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary upon request.

      (b) All labels required to be submitted for approval as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section will be submitted to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff. A parent company for a corporation may submit only one label application for a product produced in other establishments that are owned by the corporation.

      (c) The Food Safety and Inspection Service requires the submission of labeling applications for the following:

      (1) Sketch labels as defined in paragraph (d) of this section for products which are produced under a religious exemption;

      (2) [Reserved]

      (3) Special statements and claims as defined in paragraph (e) of this section and presented in the context of a final label.

      (4) Requests for the temporary use of final labels as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (d) A “sketch” label is the concept of a label. It may be a printer's proof or equivalent that is sufficiently legible to clearly show all labeling features, size, and location. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will accept sketches that are hand drawn or computer generated, or other reasonable facsimiles that clearly reflect and project the final version of the label.

      (e) “Special statements and claims” are statements, claims, logos, trademarks, and other symbols on labels as defined in this paragraph (e).

      (1) The following are considered special statements and claims:

      (i) Those not defined in the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations or the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book;

      (ii) “Natural” claims, regardless of whether they are defined in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book; and

      (iii) Health claims (including graphic representations of hearts), ingredient and processing method claims ( high-pressure processing), structure-function claims, claims regarding the raising of animals ( “no antibiotics administered”), products labeled as organic (except for those where only individual ingredients are labeled as organic), and instructional or disclaimer statements concerning pathogens ( “for cooking only” or “not tested for  O157:H7”).

      (2) The following are not considered special statements and claims:

      (i) Allergen statements ( “contains soy”) applied in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act;

      (ii) Negative claims regarding ingredients not listed in the ingredients statement ( “No MSG Added,” “Preservative Free,” “No Milk,” “No Pork,” or “Made Without Soy”);

      (iii) Statements that characterize a product's nutrient content in compliance with Title 9 of the CFR, such as “low fat”; and

      (iv) Claims related to geographical significance, such as “German Brand Made in the US,” or those that make a country of origin statement on the label of any meat or poultry product “covered commodity,”   or displays of geographic landmarks, such as a foreign country's flag, monument, or map.

      (f)(1) Temporary approval for the use of a final label that may be deemed deficient in some particular may be granted by the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff. Temporary approvals may be granted for a period not to exceed 180 calendar days, under the following conditions:

      (i) The proposed label would not misrepresent the product;

      (ii) The use of the label would not present any potential health, safety, or dietary problems to the consumer;

      (iii) Denial of the request would create undue economic hardship; and

      (iv) An unfair competitive advantage would not result from the granting of the temporary approval.

      (2) Extensions of temporary approvals may also be granted by the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff provided that the applicant demonstrates that new circumstances, meeting the above criteria, have developed since the original temporary approval was granted.

      § 412.2   Approval of generic labels.

#### § § 412.2

      (a)(1) An official establishment, or an establishment certified under a foreign inspection system in accordance with part 327, or part 381, subpart T of this chapter, is authorized to use generically approved labels, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, and thus is free to use such labels without submitting them to the Food Safety and Inspection Service for approval, provided the label, in accordance with this section, displays all mandatory features in a prominent manner in compliance with part 317 or part 381, and is not otherwise false or misleading in any particular.

      (2) The Food Safety and Inspection Service will select samples of generically approved labels from the records maintained by official establishments and establishments certified under foreign inspection systems, in accordance with part 327 or part 381, subpart T, to determine compliance with label requirements. If the Agency finds that an establishment is using a false or misleading label, it will institute the proceedings prescribed in § 500.8 of this chapter to revoke the approval for the label.

      (b) Generically approved labels are labels that bear all applicable mandatory labeling features ( product name, handling statement, ingredients statement, the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, net weight, legend, safe handling instructions, and nutrition labeling) in accordance with Federal regulations and do not bear special statements and claims as defined in § 412.1(e).

      §  412.3   Approval of U.S.-origin generic label claims.

#### § §  412.3

      (a) The claims “Product of USA” and “Made in the USA” may be used under generic approval on labels to designate single ingredient products derived from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States.

      (b)(1) The claims “Product of USA” and “Made in the USA” may be used under generic approval on labels to designate multi-ingredient products if:

      (i) All ingredients that are produced under FSIS mandatory inspection or voluntary inspection services in the product are derived from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States;

      (ii) All other ingredients in the product are of domestic origin; and

      (iii) The preparation and processing steps for the multi-ingredient product have occurred in the United States.

      (2) For purposes of this paragraph (b), spices and flavorings need not be of domestic origin for claim use, but all other ingredients of the product must be of domestic origin.

      (c) Claims other than “Product of USA” and “Made in the USA” may be used under generic approval on labels to designate the U.S.-origin component of single ingredient and multi-ingredient products' preparation and processing only if the claim includes a description of the preparation and processing steps that occurred in the United States upon which the claim is being made. Such labels must be truthful and not misleading.

      (d) Claims may be used under generic approval on labels to designate the U.S. State, Territory, or locality-origin of single ingredient and multi-ingredient products or components of a product's preparation and processing, only if the claim meets the requirements for use of U.S.-origin claims under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section with regards to the U.S. State, territory, or locality origin.

      (e) Display of the U.S. flag, or a U.S. State or territory flag, may be used under generic approval on labels to designate the United States, U.S. State, or U.S. territory origin of single and multi-ingredient products or components of a product's preparation and processing, only if the display of the flag meets the requirements for use of U.S.-origin claims under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. For the purposes of the display of a flag that meets the requirements for use of U.S.-origin claims other than “Product of USA” and “Made in the USA” under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the display must be accompanied by a description of the preparation and processing steps that occurred in the United States, or in the U.S. State or territory, upon which the claim is being made.

      (f) In addition to the requirements in § 412.2, official establishments using and facilities choosing to use labels that bear the claims “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA” to designate products of U.S. origin must maintain records to support the U.S.-origin claim. Examples of the types of documentation that may be maintained to support the U.S.-origin claims “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA” include:

      (1) A written description of the controls used in the birthing, raising, slaughter, and processing of the source animals and eggs, and for multi-ingredient products the preparation and processing of all additional ingredients other than spices and flavorings, to ensure that each step complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (2) A written description of the controls used to trace and, as necessary, segregate, from the time of birth through packaging and wholesale or retail distribution, source animals and eggs, all additional ingredients other than spices and flavorings, and resulting products that comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (3) A signed and dated document describing how the product is prepared and processed to support that the claim is not false or misleading.

      (g) In addition to the requirements in § 412.2, official establishments using and facilities choosing to use a U.S.-origin label claim other than “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA” to designate the U.S.-origin preparation and processing steps of a product must maintain records to support the qualified U.S.-origin claim. Examples of the types of documentation that may be maintained to support the qualified U.S.-origin claim include:

      (1) A written description of the controls used in each applicable preparation and processing step of source animals and eggs, all additional ingredients other than spices and flavorings, and resulting products to demonstrate that the qualified U.S.-origin claim complies with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The described controls may include those used to trace and, as necessary, segregate, during each applicable step, source animals and eggs, all additional ingredients other than spices and flavorings, and resulting products that comply with the U.S.-origin claim from those that do not comply.

      (2) A signed and dated document describing how the qualified U.S.-origin claim regarding the preparation and processing steps is not false or misleading.

When the sewage disposal system is a private system requiring approval by a State or local health authority, the establishment must furnish FSIS with the letter of approval from that authority upon request.

      (g)  (1) A supply of running water that complies with the National Primary Drinking Water regulations (40 CFR part 141), at a suitable temperature and under pressure as needed, must be provided in all areas where required (for processing product, for cleaning rooms and equipment, utensils, and packaging materials, for employee sanitary facilities, etc.). If an establishment uses a municipal water supply, it must make available to FSIS, upon request, a water report, issued under the authority of the State or local health agency, certifying or attesting to the potability of the water supply. If an establishment uses a private well for its water supply, it must make available to FSIS, upon request, documentation certifying the potability of the water supply that has been renewed at least semi-annually.

      (2) Water, ice, and solutions (such as brine, liquid smoke, or propylene glycol) used to chill or cook ready-to-eat product may be reused for the same purpose, provided that they are maintained free of pathogenic organisms and fecal coliform organisms and that other physical, chemical, and microbiological contamination have been reduced to prevent adulteration of product.

      (3) Water, ice, and solutions used to chill or wash raw product may be reused for the same purpose provided that measures are taken to reduce physical, chemical, and microbiological contamination so as to prevent contamination or adulteration of product. Reuse that which has come into contact with raw product may not be used on ready-to-eat product.

      (4) Reconditioned water that has never contained human waste and that has been treated by an onsite advanced wastewater treatment facility may be used on raw product, except in product formulation, and throughout the facility in edible and inedible production areas, provided that measures are taken to ensure that this water meets the criteria prescribed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Product, facilities, equipment, and utensils coming in contact with this water must undergo a separate final rinse with non-reconditioned water that meets the criteria prescribed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

      (5) Any water that has never contained human waste and that is free of pathogenic organisms may be used in edible and inedible product areas, provided it does not contact edible product. For example, such reuse water may be used to move heavy solids, to flush the bottom of open evisceration troughs, or to wash antemortem areas, livestock pens, trucks, poultry cages, picker aprons, picking room floors, and similar areas within the establishment.

      (6) Water that does not meet the use conditions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section may not be used in areas where edible product is handled or prepared or in any manner that would allow it to adulterate edible product or create insanitary conditions.

      (h)  (1) Dressing rooms, toilet rooms, and urinals must be sufficient in number, ample in size, conveniently located, and maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair at all times to ensure cleanliness of all persons handling any product. They must be separate from the rooms and compartments in which products are processed, stored, or handled.

      (2) Lavatories with running hot and cold water, soap, and towels, must be placed in or near toilet and urinal rooms and at such other places in the establishment as necessary to ensure cleanliness of all persons handling any product.

      (3) Refuse receptacles must be constructed and maintained in a manner that protects against the creation of insanitary conditions and the adulteration of product.

      § 417.1   Definitions.

#### § § 417.1

      For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:

      Procedures to be followed when a deviation occurs.

      A point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and, as a result, a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

      The maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical hazard must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.

      Any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.

      The HACCP plan in operation, including the HACCP plan itself.

      SEE

      Physical, chemical, or other means that can be used to control an identified food safety hazard.

      An instrument or device used to indicate conditions during processing at a critical control point.

      The individual with overall authority on-site or a higher level official of the establishment.

      § 417.2   Hazard Analysis and HACCP Plan.

#### § § 417.2

      (a)  (1) Every official establishment shall conduct, or have conducted for it, a hazard analysis to determine the food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in the production process and identify the preventive measures the establishment can apply to control those hazards. The hazard analysis shall include food safety hazards that can occur before, during, and after entry into the establishment. A food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent establishment would establish controls because it historically has occurred, or because there is a reasonable possibility that it will occur in the particular type of product being processed, in the absence of those controls.

      (2) A flow chart describing the steps of each process and product flow in the establishment shall be prepared, and the intended use or consumers of the finished product shall be identified.

      (3) Food safety hazards might be expected to arise from the following:

      (i) Natural toxins;

      (ii) Microbiological contamination;

      (iii) Chemical contamination;

      (iv) Pesticides;

      (v) Drug residues;

      (vi) Zoonotic diseases;

      (vii) Decomposition;

      (viii) Parasites;

      (ix) Unapproved use of direct or indirect food or color additives; and

      (x) Physical hazards.

      (b)  (1) Every establishment shall develop and implement a written HACCP plan covering each product produced by that establishment whenever a hazard analysis reveals one or more food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, based on the hazard analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, including products in the following processing categories:

      (i) Slaughter—all species.

      (ii) Raw product—ground.

      (iii) Raw product—not ground.

      (iv) Thermally processed—commercially sterile.

      (v) Not heat treated—shelf stable.

      (vi) Heat treated—shelf stable.

      (vii) Fully cooked—not shelf stable.

      (viii) Heat treated but not fully cooked—not shelf stable.

      (ix) Product with secondary inhibitors—not shelf stable.

      (2) A single HACCP plan may encompass multiple products within a single processing category identified in this paragraph, if the food safety hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and procedures required to be identified and performed in paragraph (c) of this section are essentially the same, provided that any required features of the plan that are unique to a specific product are clearly delineated in the plan and are observed in practice.

      (3) HACCP plans for thermally processed/commercially sterile products do not have to address the food safety hazards associated with microbiological contamination if the product is produced in accordance with the requirements of part 431 of this chapter.

      (c)  The HACCP plan shall, at a minimum:

      (1) List the food safety hazards identified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, which must be controlled for each process.

      (2) List the critical control points for each of the identified food safety hazards, including, as appropriate:

      (i) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards that could be introduced in the establishment, and

      (ii) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards introduced outside the establishment, including food safety hazards that occur before, during, and after entry into the establishment;

      (3) List the critical limits that must be met at each of the critical control points. Critical limits shall, at a minimum, be designed to ensure that applicable targets or performance standards established by FSIS, and any other requirement set forth in this chapter pertaining to the specific process or product, are met;

      (4) List the procedures, and the frequency with which those procedures will be performed, that will be used to monitor each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the critical limits;

      (5) Include all corrective actions that have been developed in accordance with § 417.3(a) of this part, to be followed in response to any deviation from a critical limit at a critical control point; and

      (6) Provide for a recordkeeping system that documents the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall contain the actual values and observations obtained during monitoring.

      (7) List the verification procedures, and the frequency with which those procedures will be performed, that the establishment will use in accordance with § 417.4 of this part.

      (d)  (1) The HACCP plan shall be signed and dated by the responsible establishment individual. This signature shall signify that the establishment accepts and will implement the HACCP plan.

      (2) The HACCP plan shall be dated and signed:

      (i) Upon initial acceptance;

      (ii) Upon any modification; and

      (iii) At least annually, upon reassessment, as required under § 417.4(a)(3) of this part.

      (e) Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 456, 463, 608, and 621, the failure of an establishment to develop and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section, or to operate in accordance with the requirements of this part, may render the products produced under those conditions adulterated.

      § 417.3   Corrective actions.

#### § § 417.3

      (a) The written HACCP plan shall identify the corrective action to be followed in response to a deviation from a critical limit. The HACCP plan shall describe the corrective action to be taken, and assign responsibility for taking corrective action, to ensure:

      (1) The cause of the deviation is identified and eliminated;

      (2) The CCP will be under control after the corrective action is taken;

      (3) Measures to prevent recurrence are established; and

      (4) No product that is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation enters commerce.

      (b) If a deviation not covered by a specified corrective action occurs, or if another unforeseen hazard arises, the establishment shall:

      (1) Segregate and hold the affected product, at least until the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section are met;

      (2) Perform a review to determine the acceptability of the affected product for distribution;

      (3) Take action, when necessary, with respect to the affected product to ensure that no product that is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated, as a result of the deviation, enters commerce;

      (4) Perform or obtain reassessment by an individual trained in accordance with § 417.7 of this part, to determine whether the newly identified deviation or other unforeseen hazard should be incorporated into the HACCP plan.

      (c) All corrective actions taken in accordance with this section shall be documented in records that are subject to verification in accordance with § 417.4(a)(2)(iii) and the recordkeeping requirements of § 417.5 of this part.

      § 417.4   Validation, Verification, Reassessment.

#### § § 417.4

      (a) Every establishment shall validate the HACCP plan's adequacy in controlling the food safety hazards identified during the hazard analysis, and shall verify that the plan is being effectively implemented.

      (1)  Upon completion of the hazard analysis and development of the HACCP plan, the establishment shall conduct activities designed to determine that the HACCP plan is functioning as intended. During this HACCP plan validation period, the establishment shall repeatedly test the adequacy of the CCP's, critical limits, monitoring and recordkeeping procedures, and corrective actions set forth in the HACCP plan. Validation also encompasses reviews of the records themselves, routinely generated by the HACCP system, in the context of other validation activities.

      (2)  Ongoing verification activities include, but are not limited to:

      (i) The calibration of process-monitoring instruments;

      (ii) Direct observations of monitoring activities and corrective actions; and

      (iii) The review of records generated and maintained in accordance with § 417.5(a)(3) of this part.

      (3)(i)  Every establishment shall reassess the adequacy of the HACCP plan at least annually and whenever any changes occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the HACCP plan. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; personnel; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product. The reassessment shall be performed by an individual trained in accordance with § 417.7 of this part. The HACCP plan shall be modified immediately whenever a reassessment reveals that the plan no longer meets the requirements of § 417.2(c) of this part.

      (ii) Each establishment must make a record of each reassessment required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and must document the reasons for any changes to the HACCP plan based on the reassessment, or the reasons for not changing the HACCP plan based on the reassessment. For annual reassessments, if the establishment determines that no changes are needed to its HACCP plan, it is not required to document the basis for this determination.

      (b)  Any establishment that does not have a HACCP plan because a hazard analysis has revealed no food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur shall reassess the adequacy of the hazard analysis whenever a change occurs that could reasonably affect whether a food safety hazard exists. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product.

The rules in this part further the purposes of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) by, among other things, preventing the adulteration or misbranding of meat and poultry products at official establishments. 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter A, Parts 318 and 319, Subpart C of this part, and 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, specify rules for the use of certain food ingredients (e.g., food additives and color additives) and sources of radiation that may render meat or poultry products adulterated or misbranded.

      Subpart C—Food Ingredients and Sources of Radiation

        § 424.21   Use of food ingredients and sources of radiation.

#### § § 424.21

        (a)(1)  No meat or poultry product shall bear or contain any food ingredient that would render it adulterated or misbranded, or which is not approved in this part, part 318 or part 319 of this chapter, or by the Administrator in specific cases.

        (2)(i) Poultry products and poultry broth used in the processing of poultry products shall have been processed in the United States only in an official establishment or imported from a foreign country determined to be eligible to export such products to the United States under § 381.196(b), and have been inspected and passed in accordance with the regulations. Detached ova and offal shall not be used in the processing of any poultry products, except that poultry feet may be processed for use as human food in a manner approved by the Administrator in specific cases and detached ova may be used in the processing of poultry products if the processor demonstrates that such ova comply with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

        (ii) Liquid, frozen, and dried egg products used in the processing of any poultry product shall have been prepared under inspection and be so marked in accordance with the Egg Products Inspection Act.

        (3) Carcasses, parts thereof, and products of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines may be used in the processing of poultry products only if they were prepared in the United States in an official meat packing establishment or imported from a foreign country determined to be eligible to export such products to the United States under § 327.2(b), were inspected and passed in accordance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the regulations under such Act (subchapter A of this chapter), and are so marked.

        (b)(1)  Food ingredients and sources of radiation listed or approved for use in the production of meat or poultry products in 21 CFR chapter I, subchapter A or subchapter B, shall be listed for such use under this chapter, subject to declaration requirements in parts 316 and 317, or subparts M and N, of part 381 of this chapter, unless precluded from such use or further restricted in parts 318 or 319, or subparts O and P, of part 381 of this chapter, or unless such use otherwise results in the adulteration or misbranding of meat or poultry products. Food ingredients and sources of radiation listed or approved for use in the production of meat or poultry products in 21 CFR Chapter I, subchapter A or subchapter B, may be listed or approved for such use under this chapter by the Administrator in § 424.21, subject to declaration requirements in parts 316 and 317, or subparts M and N, of part 381 of this chapter.

        (2) No food ingredients or sources of radiation may be used in the preparation of any meat or poultry product, for any purpose, unless the use is listed or approved in 21 CFR chapter I as a direct food additive (21 CFR part 172), a secondary direct food additive (21 CFR part 173), indirect food additive (21 CFR parts 174-178), radiation source (21 CFR part 179), an interim-listed direct food additive (21 CFR part 180), a prior-sanctioned substance (21 CFR part 181), a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substance (21 CFR parts 182 or 184), or by a regulation in this chapter. Part 319 of this chapter also specifies other food ingredients that are acceptable in preparing specified products.

        (3) No food ingredient, the intended use of which is to impart color in any meat or poultry product, shall be used unless such use is approved in 21 CFR chapter I as a color additive (21 CFR Parts 73, 74, 81, and 82) or in a regulation in this chapter.

        (4) Petitions to amend 21 CFR chapter I to provide for uses of food additives, or other substances or sources of radiation necessary in the preparation of meat or poultry products, or food ingredients used to impart color to product, should be sent to the Food and Drug Administration, in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR parts 71 or 171, as appropriate.

        (5) Inquiries concerning the regulatory status under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of any articles intended for use as components of, or in contact with, meat or poultry products, may be addressed to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, SW, Washington, DC 20204, or the Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Office of Policy, Program Development and Evaluation, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

        (6) Inquiries concerning the use in specific meat or poultry products of substances that are not affirmed by the Food and Drug Administration as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) or otherwise listed in 21 CFR part 182 or part 184, or of food or color additives listed in 21 CFR regulations for general use in foods or for use in meat, or poultry products, generally, including mixtures of such substances or additives, should be addressed to the Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Office of Policy, Program Development and Evaluation, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

        § 424.22   Certain other permitted uses.

#### § § 424.22

        (a) Under appropriate declaration as required in parts 316 and 317 of this chapter, the following substances may be added to meat:

        (1)  Common salt, approved sugars (sucrose, cane or beet sugar), maple sugar, dextrose, invert sugar, honey, corn syrup solids (corn syrup, glucose syrup and fructose), wood smoke, vinegar, flavorings, spices, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite, and other food and color additives specified in the chart in paragraph (c) of this section may be added to meat under conditions, if any, specified in this part or in part 317 of this chapter.

        (2)  Other harmless artificial flavorings may be added to meat, with the approval of the Administrator in specific cases.

        (3)  Coloring matter and dyes, other than those specified in a regulation permitting that use in this chapter or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A and Subchapter B, may be applied to meat mixed with rendered fat, applied to natural and artificial casings, and applied to such casings enclosing products, if approved by the Administrator in specific cases. When any coloring matter or dye is applied to casings, there shall be no penetration of coloring into the product.

        (b) —(1)  With respect to bacon injected with curing ingredients and massaged bacon, sodium nitrite shall be used at 120 parts per million (ppm) ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite shall be used (148 ppm ingoing); and 550 ppm of sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate) shall be used. Sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate have a molecular weight of approximately 198. Hydrated forms of these substances shall be adjusted to attain the equivalent of 550 ppm of sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate.

        (i) The Department shall collect samples of pumped bacon from producing plants and analyze them for the level of nitrosamines by the Thermal Energy Analyzer (TEA). In the event that a TEA analysis indicates that a confirmable level of nitrosamines might be present, additional samples shall be collected and analyzed by gas chromatography. Presumptive positive results must be confirmed by mass spectrometry before being considered positive. If during the interval required for the Department to analyze the confirmatory samples by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, changes are made in processing procedures which are expected to result in no confirmable levels of nitrosamines in pumped bacon produced by these new procedures, an establishment may submit samples to USDA for analysis upon prior notification and arrangements with USDA. If, however, an establishment furnishes USDA with laboratory results from testing five consecutive lots of pumped bacon produced under the new procedures and the testing is performed by the USDA methodology and procedures, those results will be utilized in making the determination concerning the product produced under the new procedures. Should the results of these tests reveal that confirmable levels of nitrosamines are not indicated in any of the five consecutive lots, the confirmation analysis by USDA shall be terminated and the establishment shall revert to normal monitoring status. In the event the test results continue to indicate nitrosamines, however, USDA shall proceed in its confirmation analysis on the original samples taken for confirmation. If any one of the original samples collected by USDA for confirmation is found to contain confirmable levels of nitrosamines, all pumped bacon in the producing establishment and all future production will be retained. The Department shall sample and analyze such retained pumped bacon for nitrosamines on a lot by lot basis. A production lot shall be that pumped bacon produced by the establishment in any single shift. Samples from any lot of pumped bacon under retention found to contain nitrosamines at a confirmable level shall cause the lot of pumped bacon to be disposed of in a manner to ensure it will not form nitrosamines when cooked. Such disposal may include incorporation of the uncooked pumped bacon as an ingredient of another meat provided it is processed for eating without further preparation in a manner to preclude the formation of nitrosamines. Bacon subsequently produced shall not be retained because of nitrosamines if the operator of the establishment makes adjustments in the processing of the product and laboratory results obtained by TEA analysis of samples from five consecutive normal sized lots of pumped bacon indicates that the product being produced contains no confirmable levels of nitrosamines. These tests from five consecutive normal sized lots of pumped bacon shall be conducted by the Department. However, if the establishment furnishes the Department with the results of tests conducted under the methodology and procedures used by the Department, such test results will be utilized in making the determination concerning the nitrosamine content of the product. All tests of pumped bacon for nitrosamines under this paragraph (b)(1)(i) shall be made on pumped bacon cooked at 340 degrees F. for 3 minutes on each side. In order to determine that no confirmable levels of nitrosamines are present in a sample tested, the testing must be performed by methodology and procedures that would detect the presence of any nitrosamines at 10 ppb.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, sodium nitrite may be used at:

        (A) 100 ppm ingoing (potassium nitrite at 123 ppm ingoing); and 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate) shall be used; or

        (B) A predetermined level between 40 and 80 ppm (potassium nitrite at a level between 49 and 99 ppm); 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate); and additional sucrose or other similar fermentable carbohydrate at a minimum of 0.7 percent and an inoculum of lactic acid producing bacteria such as  or other bacteria demonstrated to be equally effective in preventing the production of botulinum toxin at a level sufficient for the purpose of preventing the production of botulinum toxin.

        (C) The Department shall collect samples of bacon from establishments producing under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and analyze them for the level of nitrosamines. Samples shall be randomly selected throughout the production of a lot. The actual sampling plans and methods of analysis that are used will result in approximately the same likelihood as under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section of having a presumptive positive result when the true mean level of nitrosamines in a production lot is 10 ppb. In the event of a presumptive positive result, the establishment shall become subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

        (2)  Immersion cured bacon may be placed in a brine solution containing salt, nitrite and flavoring material or in a container with salt, nitrite and flavoring material. Sodium nitrite shall not exceed 120 ppm ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite (148 ppm ingoing) based on the actual or estimated skin-free green weight of the bacon bellies.

        (3)  With respect to bacon made with dry curing materials, the product shall be cured by applying a premeasured amount of cure mixture to the bacon belly surfaces, completely covering the surfaces. Sodium nitrite shall not exceed 200 ppm ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite (246 ppm ingoing) in dry cured bacon based on the actual or estimated skin-free green weight of the bacon belly.

        (c) Irradiation of meat food and poultry products.

        (1)  Meat food and poultry products may be treated to reduce foodborne pathogens and to extend product shelf-life by the use of sources of ionizing radiation as identified in 21 CFR 179.26(a). Official establishments must irradiate meat food and poultry products in accordance with 21 CFR 179.26(b), the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system requirements in part 417 of this chapter, and the provisions of this section.

        (2)  Official establishments that irradiate meat food and poultry products must have the following procedures in place:

        (i) Laboratory operation procedures for determining the absorbed dose value from the dosimeter.

        (ii) Calibration criteria for verifying the accuracy and consistency of any means of measurement ( time clocks and weight scales).

        (iii) Calibration and accountability criteria for verifying the traceability and accuracy of dosimeters for the intended purpose, and the verification of calibration at least every 12 months. To confirm traceability, establishments must relate, through documentation, the end point measurement of a dosimeter to recognized standards.

        (iv) Procedures for ensuring that the product unit is dose mapped to identify the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose and such regions are consistent from one product unit to another of like product.

        (v) Procedures for accounting for the total absorbed dose received by the product unit (e.g., partial applications of the absorbed dose within one production lot).

        (vi) Procedures for verifying routine dosimetry, i.e., assuring each production lot receives the total absorbed dose. Establishments may either position one dosimeter at the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose (or at one region verified to represent such) on at least the first, middle, and last product unit in each production lot or use statistically based validation and dose mapping to determine the number and placement of dosimeters in each production lot.

        (vii) Procedures for verifying the relationship of absorbed dose as measured by the dosimeter to time exposure of the product unit to the radiation source.

        (viii) Procedures for verifying the integrity of the radiation source and processing procedure. Aside from expected and verified radiation source activity decay for radionuclide sources, the radiation source or processing procedure must not be altered, modified, replenished, or adjusted without repeating dose mapping of product units to redefine the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose.

        (3)  Official establishments that irradiate meat food or poultry products must have the following documentation on premises, available to FSIS:

        (i) Documentation that the irradiation facility is licensed or possesses gamma radiation sources registered with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the appropriate State government acting under authority granted by the NRC.

        (ii) Documentation that the machine radiation source irradiation facility is registered with the appropriate State government, if applicable.

        (iii) Documentation that a worker safety program addressing OSHA regulations (29 CFR chapter XVII) is in place.

        (iv) Citations or other documents that relate to incidences in which the establishment was found not to comply with Federal or State agency requirements for irradiation facilities.

        (v) A certification by the operator that the irradiation facility personnel will only operate under supervision of a person who has successfully completed a course of instruction for operators of food irradiation facilities.

        (vi) A certification by the operator that the key irradiation personnel, who monitor or control daily operations, have been trained in food technology, irradiation processing, and radiation health and safety.

        (vii) Guarantees from the suppliers of all food-contact packaging materials that may be subject to irradiation that those materials comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 ).

        (4)  (i) The labels on packages of meat food and poultry products irradiated in their entirety, in conformance with this section and with 21 CFR 179.26(a) and (b), must bear the logo shown at the end of this paragraph. Unless the word “Irradiated” is part of the product name, labels also must bear a statement such as “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation.” The logo must be placed in conjunction with the required statement, if the statement is used. The statement is not required to be more prominent than the declaration of ingredients required under § 317.2(c)(2) of this chapter.

        (ii) For meat food or poultry products that have been irradiated in their entirety, but that are not sold in packages, the required logo must be displayed to the purchaser with either the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or a counter sign, card, or other appropriate device bearing the information that the product has been treated with radiation. In either case, the information must be prominently and conspicuously displayed to purchasers. Unless the word “Irradiated” is part of the product name, the labeling counter sign, card, or other device also must bear a statement such as “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation.” The logo must be placed in conjunction with the required statement, if the statement is used.

        (iii) The inclusion of an irradiated meat food or poultry product ingredient in any multi-ingredient meat food or poultry product must be reflected in the ingredient statement on the finished product labeling.

        (iv) Optional labeling statements about the purpose for radiation processing may be included on the product label in addition to the stated requirements elsewhere in this section, provided that such statements are not false or misleading. Statements that there has been a specific reduction in microbial pathogens must be substantiated by processing documentation.

RTE product is adulterated if it contains  or if it comes into direct contact with a food contact surface that is contaminated with  Establishments must not release into commerce product that contains  or that has been in contact with a food contact surface contaminated with  without first reworking the product using a process that is destructive of

      (b) In order to maintain the sanitary conditions necessary to meet this requirement, an establishment producing post-lethality exposed RTE product must comply with the requirements included in one of the three following alternatives:

      (1)  Use of a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product  an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of  If an establishment chooses this alternative:

      (i) The post-lethality treatment must be included in the establishment's HACCP plan. The antimicrobial agent or process used to suppress or limit the growth of the pathogen must be included in either the establishment's HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program.

      (ii) The establishment must validate the effectiveness of the post-lethality treatment incorporated in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4. The establishment must document, either in its HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program, that the antimicrobial agent or process, as used, is effective in suppressing or limiting growth of

      (2)  Use of either a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces _or_ eliminates microorganisms on the product  an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits growth of  If an establishment chooses this alternative:

      (i) The post-lethality treatment must be included in the establishment's HACCP plan. The antimicrobial agent or process used to suppress or limit growth of the pathogen must be included in either the establishment's HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program.

      (ii) The establishment must validate the effectiveness of a post-lethality treatment incorporated in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4. The establishment must document in its HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program that the antimicrobial agent or process, as used, is effective in suppressing or limiting growth of

      (iii) If an establishment chooses this alternative and chooses to use only an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of  its sanitation program must:

      (A) Provide for testing of food contact surfaces in the post-lethality processing environment to ensure that the surfaces are sanitary and free of  or of an indicator organism;

      (B) Identify the conditions under which the establishment will implement hold-and-test procedures following a positive test of a food-contact surface for an indicator organism;

      (C) State the frequency with which testing will be done;

      (D) Identify the size and location of the sites that will be sampled; and

      (E) Include an explanation of why the testing frequency is sufficient to ensure that effective control of  or of indicator organisms is maintained.

      (iv) An establishment that chooses this alternative and uses a post-lethality treatment of product will likely be subject to more frequent verification testing by FSIS than if it had chosen Alternative 1. An establishment that chooses this alternative and uses an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of  will likely be subject to more frequent FSIS verification testing than if it uses a post-lethality treatment.

      (3)  Use of sanitation measures only.

      (i) If an establishment chooses this alternative, its sanitation program must:

      (A) Provide for testing of food contact surfaces in the post-lethality processing environment to ensure that the surfaces are sanitary and free of  or of an indicator organism;

      (B) Identify the conditions under which the establishment will implement hold-and-test procedures following a positive test of a food-contact surface for an indicator organism;

      (C) State the frequency with which testing will be done;

      (E) Include an explanation of why the testing frequency is sufficient to ensure that effective control of  or of indicator organisms is maintained.

      (ii) An establishment producing a deli product or a hotdog product, in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, must meet the following requirements:

      (A) The establishment must verify that the corrective actions that it takes with respect to sanitation after an initial positive test for  or an indicator organism on a food contact surface in the post-lethality processing environment are effective by conducting follow-up testing that includes a targeted test of the specific site on the food contact surface area that is the most likely source of contamination by the organism and such additional tests in the surrounding food contact surface area as are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the corrective actions.

      (B) During this follow-up testing, if the establishment obtains a second positive test for an indicator organism, the establishment must hold lots of product that may have become contaminated by contact with the food contact surface until the establishment corrects the problem indicated by the test result.

      (C) In order to release into commerce product held under this section, the establishment must sample and test the lots for  or an indicator organism using a sampling method and frequency that will provide a level of statistical confidence that ensures that each lot is not adulterated with  The establishment must document the results of this testing. Alternatively, the establishment may rework the held product using a process that is destructive of  or the indicator organism.

      (iii) An establishment that chooses Alternative 3 is likely to be subject to more frequent verification testing by FSIS than an establishment that has chosen Alternative 1 or 2. An establishment that chooses Alternative 3 and that produces deli meat or hotdog products is likely to be subject to more frequent verification testing than one that does not produce such products.

      (c) For all three alternatives in paragraph (b):

      (1) Establishments may use verification testing that includes tests for  or an indicator organism, such as  species, to verify the effectiveness of their sanitation procedures in the post-lethality processing environment.

      (2) Sanitation measures for controlling  and procedures for antimicrobial agents or processes that suppress or limit the growth of the pathogen may be incorporated either in the establishment's HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program. When these control procedures are incorporated into the Sanitation SOP or prerequisite program, and not as a CCP in the HACCP plan, the establishment must have documentation that supports the decision in its hazard analysis that  is not a hazard that is reasonably likely to occur.

      (3) The establishment must maintain sanitation in the post-lethality processing environment in accordance with part 416.

      (4) If  control measures are included in the HACCP plan, the establishment must validate and verify the effectiveness of measures for controlling  included in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4.

      (5) If  control measures are included in the Sanitation SOP, the effectiveness of the measures must be evaluated in accordance with § 416.14.

      (6) If the measures for addressing  are addressed in a prerequisite program other than the Sanitation SOP, the establishment must include the program and the results produced by the program in the documentation that the establishment is required to maintain under 9 CFR 417.5.

      (7) The establishment must make the verification results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures it employs, whether under its HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program, available upon request to FSIS inspection personnel.

      § 431.2   Containers and closures.

#### § § 431.2

      (a)  (1) Empty containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock must be evaluated by the establishment to ensure that they are free of structural defects and damage that may affect product or container integrity. Such an examination should be based on a statistical sampling plan.

      (2) All empty containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock must be stored, handled, and conveyed in such a manner that will prevent damage that could affect the hermetic condition of the sealed container.

      (3) Just before filling, rigid containers must be cleaned to prevent incorporation of foreign matter into the finished product. Closures, semirigid containers, preformed flexible pouches, and flexible pouch roll stock contained in original wrappings do not need to be cleaned before use.

      (b) —(1)  A closure technician must visually examine the double seams formed by each closing machine head. When seam defects ( cutovers, sharpness, knocked down flanges, false seams, droops) are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be taken. In addition to the double seams, the entire container must be examined for product leakage or obvious defects. A visual examination must be performed on at least one container from each closing machine head, and the observations, along with any corrective actions, must be recorded. Visual examinations must be conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure and should be conducted at least every 30 minutes of continuous closing machine operation. Additional visual examinations must be made by the closure technician at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for changes in container size).

      (2)  Teardown examinations of double seams formed by each closing machine head must be performed by a closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be made at intervals of not more than 4 hours of continuous closing machine operation. At least one container from each closing head must be examined on the packer's end during each regular examination period. Examination results along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment must have container specification guidelines for double seam integrity on file and available for review by Program employees. A teardown examination of the can maker's end must be performed on at least one container selected from each closing machine during each examination period except when teardown examinations are made on incoming empty containers or when, in the case of self-manufactured containers, the containers are made in the vicinity of the establishment and the container plant records are made available to Program employees. Additional teardown examinations on the packer's end should be made at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in a closing machine and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size). The following procedures must be used in teardown examinations of double seams:

      (i)  One of the following two methods must be employed for dimensional measurements of the double seam.

      (A)  () For cylindrical containers, measure the following dimensions (Figure _1_ to § 431.2) at three points approximately 120 degrees apart on the double seam excluding and at least one-half inch from the side seam juncture:

      () Double seam length—W;

      () Double seam thickness—S;

      () Body hook length—BH; and

      () Cover hook length—CH.

      () Maximum and minimum values for each dimensional measurement must be recorded by the closure technician.

      (B)  Required measurements of the seam include thickness, body hook, and overlap.

      (ii)  Seam thickness must be obtained by micrometer. For cylindrical containers, at least two locations, excluding the side seam juncture, must be used to obtain the required measurements.

      (iii)  Regardless of the dimensional measurement method used to measure seam dimensions, at a minimum, the seam(s) examined must be stripped to assess the degree of wrinkling.

      (iv)  Regardless of the dimensional measurement method used to measure seam dimensions, the cover hook must be stripped to examine the cover hook droop at the juncture for containers having side seams.

      (v)  Examination of noncylindrical containers ( square, rectangular, “D”-shaped, and irregularly-shaped) must be conducted as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section except that the required dimensional measurements must be made on the double seam at the points listed in the establishment's container specification guidelines.

      (c) —(1)  A closure technician must visually assess the adequacy of the closures formed by each closing machine. When closure defects, such as loose or cocked caps, fractured or cracked containers and low vacuum jars, are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine must be taken and recorded. In addition to the closures, the entire container must be examined for defects. Visual examinations must be made with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure and should be conducted at least every 30 minutes of continuous closing machine operation. Additional visual examinations must be made by the closure technician and the observations recorded at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine, and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size).

      (2)  Depending upon the container and closure, tests must be performed by a closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be made either before or after thermal processing and at intervals of not more than 4 hours of continuous closing machine operation. At least one container from each closing machine must be examined during each regular examination period. Examination results along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment must have specification guidelines for closure integrity on file and available for review by Program employees. Additional closure examinations should be made at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine, and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size).

      (d) —(1) —(i)  A closure technician must visually examine the seals formed by each sealing machine. When sealing defects are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the sealing machine, must be taken and recorded. In addition to examining the heat seals, the entire container must be examined for product leakage or obvious defects. Visual examinations must be performed before and after the thermal processing operation and with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be conducted at least in accordance with a statistical sampling plan. All defects noted and corrective actions taken must be promptly recorded.

      (ii)  Tests determined by the establishment as necessary to assess container integrity must be conducted by the closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These tests must be performed after the thermal processing operation and should be made at least every 2 hours of continuous production. The establishment's acceptance guidelines for each test procedure must be on file and available for review by Program employees. Test results along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the sealing machine, must be recorded.

      (2)  Double seams on semirigid or flexible containers must be examined and the results recorded as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Any additional measurements specified by the container manufacturer must also be made and recorded.

      (e)  Each container must be marked with a permanent, legible, identifying code mark. The mark must, at a minimum, identify in code the product (unless the product name is lithographed or printed elsewhere on the container) and the day and year the product was packed.

      (f)  (1) Containers and closures must be protected from damage which may cause defects that are likely to affect the hermetic condition of the containers. The accumulation of stationary containers on moving conveyors should be minimized to avoid damage to the containers.

      (2) The maximum time lapse between closure of containers and initiation of thermal processing must be 2 hours unless data are available from the establishment's processing authority demonstrating that an alternative time period is safe and will not result in product spoilage.

      § 431.3   Thermal processing.

#### § § 431.3

      (a)  Prior to the processing of canned product for distribution in commerce, an establishment must have a process schedule (as defined in § 431.1) for each canned meat or poultry product to be packed by the establishment.

      (b)  (1) Process schedules used by an establishment must be developed or determined by a processing authority.

      (2) Any change in product formulation, ingredients, or treatments that are not already incorporated in a process schedule and that may adversely affect either the product heat penetration profile or sterilization value requirements must be evaluated by the establishment's processing authority. If it is determined that any such change adversely affects the adequacy of the process schedule, the processing authority must amend the process schedule accordingly.

      (3) Complete records concerning all aspects of the development or determination of a process schedule, including any associated incubation tests, must be made available by the establishment to the Program employee upon request.

      (c)  (1) Prior to the processing of canned product for distribution in commerce, the establishment must provide the inspector at the establishment with a list of the process schedules (including alternate schedules) along with any additional applicable information, such as the retort come-up operating procedures and critical factors.

      (2) Letters or other written communications from a processing authority recommending all process schedules must be maintained on file by the establishment. Upon request by Program employees, the establishment must make available such letters or written communications (or copies thereof). If critical factors are identified in the process schedule, the establishment must provide the inspector with a copy of the procedures for measuring, controlling, and recording these factors, along with the frequency of such measurements, to ensure that the critical factors remain within the limits used to establish the process schedule. Once submitted, the process schedules and associated critical factors and the procedures for measuring (including the frequency), controlling, and recording of critical factors must not be changed without the prior written submittal of the revised procedures (including supporting documentation) to the inspector at the establishment.

      § 431.4   Critical factors and the application of the process schedule.

#### § § 431.4

      Critical factors specified in the process schedule must be measured, controlled, and recorded by the establishment to ensure that these factors remain within the limits used to establish the process schedule. Examples of factors that are often critical to process schedule adequacy may include:

      (a)  (1) Maximum fill-in weight or drained weight;

      (2) Arrangement of pieces in the container;

      (3) Container orientation during thermal processing;

      (4) Product formulation;

      (5) Particle size;

      (6) Maximum thickness for flexible containers, and to some extent semirigid containers, during thermal processing;

      (7) Maximum pH;

      (8) Percent salt;

      (9) Ingoing (or formulated) nitrite level (ppm);

      (10) Maximum water activity; and

      (11) Product consistency or viscosity.

      (b)  (1) Minimum headspace; and

      (2) Retort reel speed.

      (c)  (1) Chain or conveyor speed.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (d)  (1) Steam/air ratio; and

      (2) Heating medium flow rate.

      § 431.5   Operations in the thermal processing area.

#### § § 431.5

      (a)  Process schedules (or operating process schedules) for daily production, including minimum initial temperatures and operating procedures for thermal processing equipment, must be posted in a conspicuous place near the thermal processing equipment. Alternatively, such information must be available to the thermal processing system operator and the inspector.

      (b)  A system for product traffic control must be established to prevent product from bypassing the thermal processing operation. Each basket, crate, or similar vehicle containing unprocessed product, or at least one visible container in each vehicle, must be plainly and conspicuously marked with a heat sensitive indicator that will visually indicate whether such unit has been thermally processed. Exposed heat sensitive indicators attached to container vehicles must be removed before such vehicles are refilled with unprocessed product. Container loading systems for crateless retorts must be designed to prevent unprocessed product from bypassing the thermal processing operation.

      (c)  The initial temperature of the contents of the coldest container to be processed must be determined and recorded by the establishment at the time the processing cycle begins to assure that the temperature of the contents of every container to be processed is not lower than the minimum initial temperature specified in the process schedule. Thermal processing systems which subject the filled and sealed containers to water at any time before process timing begins must be operated to assure that such water will not lower the temperature of the product below the minimum initial temperature specified in the process schedule.

      (d)  Devices used to time applicable thermal processing operation functions or events, such as process schedule time, come-up time, and retort venting, must be accurate to assure that all such functions or events are achieved. Pocket watches and wrist watches are not considered acceptable timing devices. Analog and digital clocks are considered acceptable. If such clocks do not display seconds, all required timed functions or events must have at least a 1-minute safety factor over the specified thermal processing operation times. Temperature/time recording devices must correspond within 15 minutes to the time of the day recorded on written records required by § 431.7.

      (e)  Unless other methods are approved by the Administrator, potentiometric methods using electronic instruments (pH meters) must be used for making pH determinations when a maximum pH value is specified as a critical factor in a process schedule.

      § 431.6   Equipment and procedures for heat processing systems.

#### § § 431.6

      (a) —(1)  Each retort must be equipped with at least one indicating temperature device that measures the actual temperature within the retort. The indicating temperature device, not the temperature/time recording device, must be used as the reference instrument for indicating the process temperature.

      (i)  A mercury-in-glass thermometer must have divisions that are readable to 1  °F (or 0.5 °C) and whose scale contains not more than 17  °F/inch (or 4.0 °C/cm) of graduated scale. Each mercury-in-glass thermometer must be tested for accuracy against a known accurate standard upon installation and at least once a year to ensure its accuracy. Records that specify the date, standard used, test method, and the person or testing authority performing the test must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees. A mercury-in-glass thermometer that has a divided mercury column or that cannot be adjusted to the standard must be repaired and tested for accuracy before further use, or replaced.

      (ii)  Temperature-indicating devices, such as resistance temperature detectors, used in lieu of mercury-in-glass thermometers, must meet known, accurate standards for such devices when tested for accuracy. The records of such testing must be available to FSIS program employees.

      (2)  Each thermal processing system must be equipped with at least one temperature/time recording device to provide a permanent record of temperatures within the thermal processing system. This recording device may be combined with the steam controller and may be a recording/controlling instrument. When compared to the known accurate indicating temperature device, the recording accuracy must be equal to or better than 1  °F (or 0.5 °C) at the process temperature. The temperature recording chart should be adjusted to agree with, but must never be higher than, the known accurate indicating temperature device. A means of preventing unauthorized changes in the adjustment must be provided. For example, a lock or a notice from management posted at or near the recording device warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments, are satisfactory means for preventing unauthorized changes. Air-operated temperature controllers must have adequate filter systems to ensure a supply of clean, dry air. The recorder timing mechanism must be accurate.

      (i)  Devices using charts must be used only with the correct chart. Each chart must have a working scale of not more than 55  °F/inch (or 12 °C/cm.) within a range of 20  °F (or 11 °C) of the process temperature. Chart graduations must not exceed 2  °F degrees (or 1 °C) within a range of 10  °F (or 5 °C) of the process temperature. Multipoint plotting chart-type devices must print temperature readings at intervals that will assure that the parameters of the process time and process temperature have been met. The frequency of recording should not exceed 1-minute intervals.

      (ii)  Temperature/time recording devices or procedures used in lieu of chart-type devices must meet known accurate standards for such devices or procedures when tested for accuracy. Such a device must be accurate enough for ensuring that process time and temperature parameters have been met.

      (3)  Each retort must be equipped with an automatic steam controller to maintain the retort temperature. This may be a recording/controlling instrument when combined with a temperature/time recording device.

      (4)  All air lines connected to retorts designed for pressure processing in steam must be equipped with a globe valve or other equivalent-type valve or piping arrangement that will prevent leakage of air into the retort during the process cycle.

      (5)  All retort water lines that are intended to be closed during a process cycle must be equipped with a globe valve or other equivalent-type valve or piping arrangement that will prevent leakage of water into the retort during the process cycle.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  The basic requirements and recommendations for indicating temperature devices and temperature/time recording devices are described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. Additionally, bulb sheaths or probes of indicating temperature devices and probes of temperature/time recording devices must be installed either within the retort shell or in external wells attached to the retort. External wells must be connected to the retort through at least a   inch (1.9 cm) diameter opening and equipped with a   inch (1.6 mm) or larger bleeder opening so located as to provide a constant flow of steam past the length of the bulb or probe. The bleeder for the external wells must emit steam continuously during the entire thermal processing period.

      (ii)  The steam inlet to each retort must be large enough to provide steam for proper operation of the retort, and must enter at a point(s) to facilitate air removal during venting.

      (iii)  If mufflers are used on bleeders or vent systems, the establishment must have on file documentation that the mufflers do not impede the removal of air from the retort. Such documentation must consist of either heat distribution data or documentation from the muffler manufacturer or from a processing authority. This information must be made available to Program employees for review.

      (iv)  Bleeders, except those for external wells of temperature devices and hydrostatic retorts, must have a   inch (or 3 mm) or larger openings and must be wide open during the entire process, including the come-up time. All bleeders must be arranged so that the retort operator can observe that they are functioning properly. For horizontal retorts, batch agitating retorts, and continuous rotary retorts, bleeders must be located within approximately 1 foot (or 30 cm) of the outmost locations of containers at each end along the top of the retort. Additional bleeders must be located not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) apart along the top. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review. Vertical retorts must have at least one bleeder opening located in the portion of the retort opposite the steam inlet. Hydrostatic retorts must have bleeder openings   inch (or 6 mm) or larger which are to be located in the steam chamber(s) opposite the point of steam entry. Bleeders may be installed at positions other than those specified above, as long as the establishment has heat distribution data or other documentation from the manufacturer or from a processing authority demonstrating that the bleeders accomplish removal of air and circulate the steam within the retort.

      (2) —(i)  Vertical still retorts with bottom steam entry must employ bottom retort crate supports. Baffle plates must not be used in the bottom of retorts.

      (ii)  Perforated steam spreaders, if used, must be maintained to ensure they are not blocked or otherwise inoperative. Horizontal still retorts must be equipped with perforated steam spreaders that extend the full length of the retort unless the adequacy of another arrangement is documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority. Such information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (iii)  In retorts having a steam inlet above the level of the lowest container, a bleeder must be installed in the bottom of the retort to remove condensate. The condensate bleeder must be so arranged that the retort operator can observe that it is functioning properly. The condensate bleeder must be checked with sufficient frequency to ensure adequate removal of condensate. Visual checks should be performed at intervals of not more than 15 minutes and the results recorded. Intermittent condensate removal systems must be equipped with an automatic alarm system that will serve as a continuous monitor of condensate bleeder functioning. The automatic alarm system must be tested at the beginning of each shift for proper functioning and the results recorded. If the alarm system is not functioning properly, it must be repaired before the retort is used.

      (iv) —(A)  Crates, trays, gondolas, carts, and other vehicles for holding or stacking product containers in the retort must be so constructed to ensure steam circulation during the venting, come-up, and process times. The bottom of each vehicle must have perforations at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter on 2 inch (or 5 cm) centers or the equivalent unless the adequacy of another arrangement is documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority and such information is maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (B)  Whenever one or more divider plates are used between any two layers of containers or placed on the bottom of a retort vehicle, the establishment must have on file documentation that the venting procedure allows the air to be removed from the retort before timing of the thermal process is started. Such documentation must be in the form of heat distribution data or documentation from a processing authority. This information must be made available to Program employees for review.

      (v)  (A) Vents must be located in that portion of the retort opposite the steam inlet and must be designed, installed, and operated in such a way that air is removed from the retort before timing of the thermal process is started. Vents must be controlled by a gate, plug cock, or other full-flow valve which must be fully opened to permit rapid removal of air from retorts during the venting period.

      (B) Vents must not be connected to a closed drain system without an atmospheric break in the line. Where a retort manifold connects several pipes from a single retort, the manifold must be controlled by a gate, plug cock, or other full-flow valve and the manifold must be of a size such that the cross-sectional area of the manifold is larger than the total cross-sectional area of all connecting vents. The discharge must not be connected to a closed drain without an atmospheric break in the line. A manifold header connecting vents or manifolds from several still retorts must lead to the atmosphere. The manifold header must not be controlled by a valve and must be of a size such that the cross-sectional area is at least equal to the total cross-sectional area of all connecting retort manifold pipes from the maximum number of retorts to be vented simultaneously.

      (C) Some typical installations and operating procedures are described below. Other retort installations, vent piping arrangements, operating procedures or auxiliary equipment such as divider plates may be used provided there is documentation that the air is removed from the retort before the process is started. Such documentation must be in the form of heat distribution data or other documentation from the equipment manufacturer or processing authority. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (D) For crateless retort installations, the establishment must have heat distribution data or other documentation from the equipment manufacturer or from a processing authority that demonstrates that the venting procedure used accomplishes the removal of air and condensate. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (E) Examples of typical installations and operating procedures that comply with the requirements of this section are as follows:

      ()  () Vent_i_ng through multiple _1_ inch (2.5 cm) vents discharging directly to the atmosphere.

      () Venting through multiple 1 inch (2.5 cm) vents discharging through a manifold to the atmosphere.

      () Venting through water spreaders.

      () Venting through a single 2  inch (6.4 cm) top vent for retorts not exceeding 15 feet (4.6 m) in length.

      ()  () Vent_i_ng through a 1  inch (3.8 cm) overflow.

      () Venting through a single 1 inch (2.5 cm) side or top vent.

      (3) —(i)  The air in the retort must be removed before processing is started. Heat distribution data or other documentation from the manufacturer or from the processing authority who developed the venting procedure must be kept on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review. At the time the steam is turned on, the drain must be opened to remove steam condensate from the retort. A bleeder must be installed in the bottom of the retort to remove condensate during retort operation. The condensate bleeder must be so arranged that the retort operator can observe that it is functioning properly. The condensate bleeder must be checked with sufficient frequency to ensure adequate removal of condensate. Visual checks should be performed at intervals of not more than 15 minutes and the results recorded. Intermittent condensate removal systems must be equipped with an automatic alarm system that will serve as a continuous monitor of condensate bleeder functioning. The automatic alarm system must be tested at the beginning of each shift for proper functioning and the results recorded. If the alarm system is not functioning properly, it must be repaired before the retort is used.

      (ii)  The retort or reel speed must be checked before process timing begins and, if needed, adjusted as specified in the process schedule. In addition, the rotational speed must be determined and recorded at least once during process timing of each retort load processed. Alternatively, a recording tachometer can be used to provide a continuous record of the speed. The accuracy of the recording tachometer must be determined and recorded at least once per shift by checking the retort or reel speed using an accurate stopwatch. A means of preventing unauthorized speed changes on retorts must be provided. For example, a lock or a notice from management posted at or near the speed adjustment device warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments is a satisfactory means of preventing unauthorized changes.

      (4) —(i)  The air in the retort must be removed before processing is started. Heat distribution data or other documentation from the manufacturer or from the processing authority who developed the venting procedure must be kept on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review. At the time the steam is turned on, the drain must be opened to remove steam condensate from the retort. A bleeder must be installed in the bottom of the shell to remove condensate during the retort operation. The condensate bleeder must be so arranged that the retort operator can observe that it is functioning properly. The condensate bleeder must be checked with sufficient frequency to ensure adequate removal of condensate. Visual checks should be performed at intervals of not more than 15 minutes and the results recorded. Intermittent condensate removal systems must be equipped with an automatic alarm system that will serve as a continuous monitor of condensate bleeder functioning. The automatic alarm system must be tested at the beginning of each shift for proper functioning and the results recorded.

      (ii)  The rotational speed of the retort must be specified in the process schedule. The speed must be adjusted as specified, and recorded by the establishment when the retort is started, and checked and recorded at intervals not to exceed 4 hours to ensure that the correct retort speed is maintained. Alternatively, a recording tachometer may be used to provide a continuous record of the speed. If a recording tachometer is used, the speed must be manually checked against an accurate stopwatch at least once per shift and the results recorded. A means of preventing unauthorized speed changes on retorts must be provided. For example, a lock or a notice from management posted at or near the speed adjustment device warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments is a satisfactory means of preventing unauthorized changes.

      (5) —(i)  The basic requirements for indicating temperature devices and temperature/time recording devices are described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. Additionally, indicating temperature devices must be located in the steam dome near the steam/water interface. Where the process schedule specifies maintenance of particular water temperatures in the hydrostatic water legs, at least one indicating temperature device must be located in each hydrostatic water leg so that it can accurately measure water temperature and be easily read. The temperature/time recorder probe must be installed either within the steam dome or in a well attached to the dome. Each probe must have a   inch (1.6 mm) or larger bleeder opening which emits steam continuously during the processing period. Additional temperature/time recorder probes must be installed in the hydrostatic water legs if the process schedule specifies maintenance of particular temperatures in these water legs.

      (ii)  The steam inlets must be large enough to provide steam for proper operation of the retort.

      (iii)  Bleeder openings   inch (or 6 mm) or larger must be located in the steam chamber(s) opposite the point of steam entry. Bleeders must be wide open and must emit steam continuously during the entire process, including the come-up time. All bleeders must be arranged in such a way that the operator can observe that they are functioning properly.

      (iv)  Before the start of processing operations, the retort steam chamber(s) must be vented to ensure removal of air.

      (v)  The conveyor speed must be calculated to obtain the required process time and recorded by the establishment when the retort is started. The speed must be checked and recorded at intervals not to exceed 4 hours to ensure that the correct conveyor speed is maintained. A recording device may be used to provide a continuous record of the conveyor speed. When a recording device is used, the speed must be manually checked against an accurate stopwatch at least once per shift by the establishment. A means of preventing unauthorized speed changes of the conveyor must be provided. For example, a lock or a notice from management posted at or near the speed adjustment device warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments is a satisfactory means of preventing unauthorized changes.

      (vi)  If mufflers are used on bleeders or vent systems, the establishment must have documentation that the mufflers do not impede the removal of air from the retort. Such documentation must consist of either heat distribution data or other documentation from the muffler manufacturer or from a processing authority. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

Compressed air and steam entry must be controlled by an automatic pressure control unit. A non-return valve must be provided in the air supply line to prevent water from entering the system. Overriding air or steam pressure must be maintained continuously during the come-up, thermal processing, and cooling periods. If air is used to promote circulation, it must be introduced into the steam line at a point between the retort and the steam control valve at the bottom of the retort. The adequacy of the air circulation for maintaining uniform heat distribution within the retort must be documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority, and such data must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (vi)  When a water recirculation system is used for heat distribution, the water must be drawn from the bottom of the retort through a suction manifold and discharged through a spreader that extends the length or circumference of the top of the retort. The holes in the water spreader must be uniformly distributed. The suction outlets must be protected with screens to keep debris from entering the recirculation system. The pump must be equipped with a pilot light or a similar device to warn the operator when it is not running, and with a bleeder to remove air when starting operations.

      (iii)  There must be a means of determining the water level in the retort during operation ( by using a gauge, electronic sensor, or sight glass indicator). Water must completely cover all containers during the entire come-up, thermal processing, and cooling periods. A means to ensure that water circulation continues as specified throughout the come-up, thermal processing, and cooling periods must be provided. The retort operator must check and record the adequacy of the water level with sufficient frequency to ensure it meets the specified processing parameters.

      (iv)  Retorts must be provided with a means for introducing compressed air or steam at the pressure required to maintain container integrity. Compressed air and steam entry must be controlled by an automatic pressure control unit. A non-return valve must be provided in the air supply line to prevent water from entering the system. Overriding air or steam pressure must be maintained continuously during the come-up, thermal processing, and cooling periods. If air is used to promote circulation, it must be introduced into the steam line at a point between the retort and the steam control valve at the bottom of the retort. The adequacy of the air circulation for maintaining uniform heat distribution within the retort must be documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority, and such data must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (v)  The retort or reel speed timing must be checked before process timing begins and, if needed, adjusted as specified in the process schedule. In addition, the rotational speed must be determined and recorded at least once during process timing of each retort load processed. Alternatively, a recording tachometer can be used to provide a continuous record of the speed. The accuracy of the recording tachometer must be determined and recorded at least once per shift by the establishment by checking the retort or reel speed using an accurate stopwatch. A means of preventing unauthorized speed changes on retorts must be provided. For example, a lock or a notice from management posted at or near the speed adjustment device warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments is a satisfactory means of preventing unauthorized changes.

      (vi)  If a water recirculation system is used for heat distribution, it must be installed in such a manner that water will be drawn from the bottom of the retort through a suction manifold and discharged through a spreader which extends the length of the top of the retort. The holes in the water spreader must be uniformly distributed. The suction outlets must be protected with screens to keep debris from entering the recirculation system. The pump must be equipped with a pilot light or a similar device to warn the operator when it is not running and with a bleeder to remove air when starting operations. Alternatively, a flow-meter alarm system can be used to ensure proper water circulation. The adequacy of water circulation for maintaining uniform heat distribution within the retort must be documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority, and such data must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review. Alternative methods for recirculation of water in the retort may be used provided there is documentation in the form of heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.

      (vii)  In retorts for processing product packed in glass jars, the incoming cooling water should not directly strike the jars, in order to minimize glass breakage by thermal shock.

      § 441.10   Retained water.

#### § § 441.10

      (a) Raw livestock, poultry, and fish carcasses and parts will not be permitted to retain water resulting from post-evisceration processing unless the establishment preparing those carcasses and parts demonstrates to FSIS, with data collected in accordance with a written protocol, that any water retained in the carcasses or parts is an unavoidable consequence of the process used to meet applicable food safety requirements.

      (b) Raw livestock, poultry, and fish carcasses and parts that retain water from post-evisceration processing and that are sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, must bear a statement on the label in prominent letters and contiguous to the product name or elsewhere on the principal display panel of the label stating the maximum percentage of water that may be retained ( “up to X% retained water,” “less than X% retained water,” “up to X% water added from processing”). The percent water statement need not accompany the product name on other parts of the label. Raw livestock and poultry carcasses and parts that retain no water may bear a statement that no water is retained.

      (c)(1) An establishment subject to paragraph (a) of this section must maintain on file and available to FSIS its written data-collection protocol. The protocol must explain how data will be collected and used to demonstrate the amount of retained water in the product covered by the protocol that is an unavoidable consequence of the process used to meet specified food safety requirements.

      (2) The establishment must notify FSIS as soon as it has a new or revised protocol available for review by the Agency. Within 30 days after receipt of this notification, FSIS may object to or require the establishment to make changes in the protocol.

      (d) Expected elements of a protocol for gathering water retention data:

      (1)  The primary purpose of the protocol should be to determine the amount or percentage of water absorption and retention that is unavoidable using a particular chilling system while achieving the regulatory pathogen reduction performance standard for  as set forth in the PR/HACCP regulations (9 CFR 310.25(b), 381.94(b)) and the time/temperature requirements set forth in 9 CFR 381.66. Additional purposes that could be included are determining chilling system efficiency and evaluating product quality.

      (2)  Any post-evisceration washing or chilling processes that affect water retention levels in and microbial loads on raw products should be described. For poultry establishments, the main chiller types, identified by the mechanism used to transport the birds through the chiller or to agitate the water in the chiller, are the drag-through, the screw type, and the rocker-arm type.

      (3)  A description of chiller-system configurations and modifications should be provided. The description should include the number and type of chillers in a series and arrangements of chilling system components, and the number of evisceration lines feeding into a chiller system. If there is a pre-chilling step in the process, its purpose and the type of equipment used should be accurately described. Any mechanical or design changes made to the chilling equipment should be described.

      (4)  Any special features in the chilling process, such as antimicrobial treatments, should be described. Also, the length and velocity of the dripping line should be described, as well as the total time allowed for dripping. Any special apparatus, such as a mechanism for squeezing excessive water from chilled birds, should be explained.

      (5)  The protocol should describe variable factors that affect water absorption and retention. In poultry processing, such factors are typically considered to be the time in chiller water, the water temperature, and agitation. The protocol should consider air agitation, where applicable. Additional factors that may affect water absorption and retention are scalding temperature and the pressure or amount of buffeting applied to birds by feather removal machinery, and the resultant loosening of the skin. Another factor that should be considered is the method used to open the bird for evisceration.

      (6)  For example, the chilling system may be designed simply to achieve a reduction in temperature of ready-to-cook poultry to less than 40 °F within the time limit specified by the regulations, or in less time. As to the standard for pathogen minimization, the  pathogen reduction standards, as set forth in the PR/HACCP final rule, have been suggested. Although there is not yet an applicable  standard for turkeys, establishments are free to adopt practicable criteria for use in gathering data on turkeys under the protocols here suggested. Additional microbiological targets, such as  or  levels, or reductions in numbers of other microorganisms, may also be used.

      (7)  The protocol should detail the testing methods to be used both for measuring water absorption and retention and for sampling and testing product for pathogen reductions. The protocol should call for water retention and pathogen reduction tests at various chilling equipment settings and chilling time-and-temperature combinations. The method to be used in calculating water absorption and retention should be reproducible and statistically verifiable. With respect to the pathogen-reduction aspect of the testing, FSIS recommends the methods used for  and  testing under the PR/HACCP regulations. The number of samples, the type of samples, the sampling time period, and the type of testing or measurement should be included in the protocol.

      (8)  The protocol should explain how data obtained are to be reported and summarized. The criteria for evaluating the results and the basis for conclusions to be drawn should be explained.

      (9)  The protocol should provide for a statement of what the data obtained demonstrate and what conclusions were reached.

      This term applies to any carcass, part thereof, fish or fish food product under one or more of the following circumstances:

      (1) If it bears or contains any such poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance, such article shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in or on such article does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;

      (2)(i) If it bears or contains (by reason of administration of any substance to the live animal or otherwise) any added poisonous or added deleterious substance (other than one which is:

      (A) A pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity;

      (8) If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom; or if any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part therefore; or if damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.

          § 590.126   Overtime inspection service.

#### § § 590.126

          When operations in an official plant require the services of inspection personnel beyond their regularly assigned tour of duty on any day or on a day outside the established schedule, such services are considered as overtime work. The official plant must give reasonable advance notice to the inspector of any overtime service necessary and must pay for such overtime. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the overtime rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt rate using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b) and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c) of this chapter.

#### § § 590.128

          (a) When an official plant requires inspection service on a holiday or a day designated in lieu of a holiday, such service is considered holiday work. The official plant must, in advance of such holiday work, request the inspector in charge to furnish inspection service during such period and must pay the Agency for such holiday work at the hourly rate. For each calendar year, FSIS calculates the holiday rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS will calculate the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt rate using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c) of this chapter.

          (b) The term “holiday” shall mean the legal public holidays specified by the Congress in paragraph (a) of section 6103, title 5 of the United States Code. Information on legal holidays may be obtained from the supervisor.

          § 590.411   Label approval.

#### § § 590.411

          (a) All official plants, including official plants certified under a foreign inspection system in accordance with § 590.910, must comply with the requirements contained in § 412.1 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this part.

          (b) For the purposes of § 412.1 of this chapter, an official establishment or establishment certified under a foreign inspection system includes an official plant.

          (c) Labels, containers, or packaging materials of egg products must show the following information, as applicable, on the principal display panel (except as otherwise permitted in this part), in accordance with the requirements of this part, or if applicable, 21 CFR 101.17(h):

          (1) A statement showing by the common or usual names, if any, of the kinds of ingredients comprising the product. Formulas are to be expressed in terms of a liquid product except for product that is dry-blended. Also, for product to be dried, the label may show the ingredients in order of descending proportions by weight in the dried form. However, the formula submitted must include the percentage of ingredients in both liquid and dried form. If the product is comprised of two or more ingredients, such ingredients must be listed in the order of descending proportions by weight in the form in which the product is to be marketed (sold), except that ingredients in dried product (other than dry blended) may be listed in either liquid or dried form. When water (excluding that used to reconstitute dehydrated ingredients back to their normal composition) is added to a liquid or frozen egg product or to an ingredient of such products (in excess of the normal water content of that ingredient), the total amount of water added, including the water content of any cellulose or vegetable gums used, must be expressed as a percentage of the total product weight in the ingredient statement on the label;

          (2) The name, address and zip code of the distributor; qualified by such terms as “distributed by,” or “distributors”;

          (3) The lot number or an alternative code indicating the date of production, in accordance with § 590.200(a);

          (4) The net contents;

          (5) An official inspection symbol and the number of the official plant in which the product was processed under inspection as set forth in § 590.413;

          (6) Egg products processed from edible eggs of turkeys, ducks, geese, or guineas must be clearly and distinctly labeled with the common or usual name of the product and indicating the type of eggs or egg products used in the product, e.g., “Frozen whole turkey eggs,” “Frozen whole chicken and turkey eggs.” Egg products labeled without qualifying words as to the type of egg used in the product must be produced only from the edible egg of the domesticated chicken.

          (7) Egg products which are produced in an official plant from edible shell eggs of other than current production or from other egg products of shell eggs of other than current product must be clearly and distinctly labeled in close proximity to the common or usual name of the product, e.g., Manufactured from eggs of other than current production.”

          (d) Liquid or frozen egg products identified as whole eggs and processed in other than natural proportions as broken from the shell must have a total egg solids content of 24.20 percent or greater.

          (e) Nutrition information may be included on labels used to identify egg products, providing such labeling complies with the provisions of 21 CFR part 101, promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Since these regulations have different requirements for consumer-packaged products than for bulk packaged egg products not for sale or distribution to household consumers, label submission must be accompanied with information indicating whether the label covers consumer packaged or bulk packaged products. Nutrition labeling is required when nutrients, such as proteins, vitamins, and minerals are added to the product, or when a nutritional claim or information is presented on the labeling, except for the following, which are exempt from nutrition labeling requirements:

          (1) Egg products shipped in bulk form for use solely in the manufacture of other food and not for distribution to household consumers in such bulk form or containers.

          (2) Products containing an added vitamin, mineral, or protein, or for which a nutritional claim is made on the label, or in advertising, which is supplied for institutional food use only, provided that the manufacturer or distributor provides the required nutrition information directly to those institutions.

          (3) Any nutrients included in the product solely for technological purposes may be declared solely in the ingredients statement, without complying with nutrition labeling, if the nutrient(s) is otherwise not referred to in labeling or in advertising. All labels showing nutrition information or claims are subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration prior to approval by the Department.

          (f)(1) No label, container, or packaging material may contain any statement that is false or misleading. If the Administrator has reason to believe that a statement or formulation shows that an egg product is adulterated or misbranded, or that any labeling, including the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use, with respect to eggs or egg products, is false or misleading in any way, the Administrator may direct that such use be withdrawn unless the labeling or container is modified in such a manner as the Administrator may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading, or the formulation of the product is altered in such a manner as the Administrator may prescribe so that it is not adulterated or would not cause misbranding.

          (2) If the Administrator directs that the use of any label, container, or packaging material be withdrawn because it contains any statement that is false or misleading, an opportunity for a hearing will be provided in accordance with § 500.8(c) of this chapter.

        (b) The official mark for identifying egg products offered for entry as “U.S. Inspected and Passed” must be in the following form, and any device approved by the Administrator for applying such mark must be an official device.

        (c) Owners or operators of plants, other than official plants, who want to have import inspections made at their plants, must apply to the Administrator for approval of their establishments for such purpose. Application must be made on a form furnished by the Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, and must include all information called for by that form.

        (d) No brand manufacturer or other person will cast or otherwise make, without an official certificate issued by inspection program personnel, a brand or other marking device containing an official inspection legend, or simulation thereof, as shown in § 590.940(b).

        (e) The inspection legend may be placed on containers of product before completion of the official import inspection if the containers are being inspected by inspection program personnel who report directly to a program supervisor, the product is not required to be held at the official import inspection establishment pending receipt of laboratory test results, and a written procedure for the controlled stamping, submitted by the official import inspection establishment and approved by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, is on file at the import inspection location where the inspection is to be performed.

        (f)(1) The written procedure for the controlled release and identification of product should be in the form of a letter and must include the following:

        (i) That stamping under this subpart is limited to those lots of product that can be inspected on the day that certificates for the product are examined;

        (ii) That all products that have been pre-stamped will be stored in the facility where the import inspection will occur;

        (iii) That inspection marks applied under this part will be removed from any lot of product subsequently refused entry on the day the product is rejected; and

        (iv) That the establishment will maintain a daily stamping log containing the following information for each lot of product: The date of inspection, the country of origin, the foreign establishment number, the product name, the number of units, the shipping container marks and foreign inspection certificate number covering the product to be inspected. The daily log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with § 590.200.

        (2) An establishment's controlled program privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector who is supervising its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this subpart or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for it must be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping program privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the controlled program was wrongfully cancelled. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing must be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. The cancellation of the controlled pre-stamping privilege will be in effect until there is a final determination of the preceding.

        § 590.945   Egg products offered for entry; reporting of findings to customs; handling of articles refused entry; appeals, how made; denaturing procedures.

#### § § 590.945

        (a)(1) Inspection program personnel must report their findings as to any product that has been inspected in accordance with this subpart to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry where the same is offered for clearance through Customs inspection.

        (2) When product is refused entry into the United States, the official mark to be applied to the product refused entry must be in the following form:

        (3) When product has been identified as “U.S. Refused Entry,” inspection program personnel must request the Director of Customs to refuse admission of such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or importer within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or importer, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of program inspectors so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or importer of the refused entry product must not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign importer for direct and immediate exportation, or to an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (4) The owner or importer will have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for “refused entry” product. An extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it, e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.

        (5) If the owner or importer fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Department will take such actions as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department will seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expenses in the appropriate forum.

        (6) No egg product that has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstances.

        § 592.510   Basetime rate.

#### § § 592.510

        (a) For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the basetime rate for inspection services, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate.

        (b) FSIS will calculate the benefits, travel and operating, overhead, and allowance for bad debt rate components of the basetime rate, using the following formulas:

        (1)  The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's direct benefits costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan basic and matching contributions.

        (2)  The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's total direct travel and operating costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.

        (3)  The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's indirect costs plus the previous fiscal year's information technology (IT) costs in the Public Health Data Communication Infrastructure System Fund plus the previous fiscal year's Office of Management Program cost in the Reimbursable and Voluntary Funds plus the provision for the operating balance less any Greenbook costs (i.e., costs of USDA support services prorated to the service component for which fees are charged) that are not related to food inspection, by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked across all funds, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.

        (4)  Previous fiscal year's allowance for bad debt (for example, debt owed that is not paid in full by plants and establishments that declare bankruptcy) divided by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.

        (c) The calendar year's cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

        § 592.520   Overtime rate.

#### § § 592.520

        When operations in an official plant require the services of inspection personnel beyond their regularly assigned tour of duty on any day or on a day outside the established schedule, such services are considered as overtime work. The official plant must give reasonable advance notice to the inspector of any overtime service necessary. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the overtime rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c).

        § 592.530   Holiday rate.

#### § § 592.530

        When an official plant requires inspection service on a holiday or a day designated in lieu of a holiday, such service is considered holiday work. The official plant must, in advance of such holiday work, request that the inspector in charge furnish inspection services during such period and must pay the Agency for such holiday work at the hourly rate. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the holiday rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c).
