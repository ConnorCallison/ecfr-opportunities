Such inquiries will also be accepted by facsimile at (703)874-5844. For general information or status information on pending cases only, the telephone number is (703)874-4121. Collect calls cannot be accepted.

      § 1800.4   Suggestions and complaints.

#### § § 1800.4

      NACIC welcomes suggestions or complaints with regard to its administration of the Freedom of Information Act. Letters of suggestion or complaint should identify the specific purpose and the issues for consideration. NACIC will respond to all substantive communications and take such actions as determined feasible and appropriate.

    Subpart B—Filing of FOIA Requests

      § 1800.11   Preliminary information.

#### § § 1800.11

      Members of the public shall address all communications to the NACIC Coordinator as specified at § 1800.03 and clearly delineate the communication as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and this regulation. NACIC employees receiving a communication in the nature of a FOIA request shall expeditiously forward same to the Coordinator. Requests and appeals on requests, referrals, or coordinations received from members of the public who owe outstanding fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and action on all pending requests shall be terminated in such circumstances.

      § 1800.12   Requirements as to form and content.

#### § § 1800.12

      (a)  No particular form is required. A request need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional employee familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable effort. Commonly this equates to a requirement that the documents must be locatable through the indexing of our various systems. Extremely broad or vague requests or requests requiring research do not satisfy this requirement.

      (b)  In addition, a requester should provide sufficient personal identifying information to allow us to determine the appropriate fee category. A requester should also provide an agreement to pay all applicable fees or fees not to exceed a certain amount or request a fee waiver.

      (c)  Communications which do not meet these requirements will be considered an expression of interest and NACIC will work with, and offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly.

      § 1800.13   Fees for record services.

#### § § 1800.13

      (a)  Search, review, and reproduction fees will be charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even if our search locates no responsive records or some or all of the responsive records must be denied under one or more of the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act.

      (b)  Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate whenever NACIC determines:

      (1) That, as a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of the United States Government would be served, or

      (2) That it is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; NACIC shall consider the following factors when making this determination:

      (i) Whether the subject of the request concerns the operations or activities of the United States Government; and, if so,

      (ii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute to an understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,

      (iii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents will contribute to public understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,

      (iv) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of United States Government operations and activities; and

      (v) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,

      (vi) Whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (c)  Denials of requests for fee waivers or reductions may be appealed to the Director, NACIC via the Coordinator. A requester is encouraged to provide any explanation or argument as to how his or her request satisfies the statutory requirement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d)  It is suggested that such requests and appeals be made and resolved prior to the initiation of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests will be accepted at any time prior to the release of documents or the completion of a case, and fee waiver appeals within forty-five (45) days of our initial decision subject to the following condition: if processing has been initiated, then the requester must agree to be responsible for costs in the event of an adverse administrative or judicial decision.

      (e)  In order to protect requesters from large and/or unanticipated charges, NACIC will request specific commitment when it estimates that fees will exceed $100.00. NACIC will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days requests requiring such agreement and will thereafter deem the request closed. This action, of course, would not prevent an individual from refiling his or her FOIA request with a fee commitment at a subsequent date.

      (f)  NACIC may require an advance deposit of up to 100 percent of the estimated fees when fees may exceed $250.00 and the requester has no history of payment, or when, for fees of any amount, there is evidence that the requester may not pay the fees which would be accrued by processing the request. NACIC will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days those requests where deposits have been requested.

      (g) —(1)  The schedule of fees for services performed in responding to requests for records is established as follows:

      (i) Personnel Search and Review

      (ii) Computer Search and Production

      (iii) Paper Production

      (2)  Personnel search time includes time expended in either manual paper records searches, indices searches, review of computer search results for relevance, personal computer system searches, and various reproduction services. In any event where the actual cost to NACIC of a particular item is less than the above schedule (e.g., a large production run of a document resulted in a cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost will be charged.

      (3)  For all other types of output, production, or reproduction (e.g., photographs, maps, or published reports), actual cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost for purposes of this part.

      (h) —(1)  No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself. That cost includes the administrative costs to NACIC of billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for deposit to the Treasury Department and, as of the date of these regulations, is deemed to be $10.00.

      (2)  No fees will be charged for requesters seeking records about themselves under the FOIA; such requests are processed in accordance with both the FOIA and the Privacy Act in order to ensure the maximum disclosure without charge.

      (i)  There are four categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes: “commercial use” requesters, “educational and non-commercial scientific institution” requesters, “representatives of the news media” requesters, and “all other” requesters. The categories are defined in § 1800.2, and applicable fees, which are the same in two of the categories, will be assessed as follows:

      (1) “Commercial use” requesters: Charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records (if any);

      (2) “Educational and non-commercial scientific institution” requesters as well as “representatives of the news media” requesters: Only charges for reproduction beyond the first 100 pages;

      (3) “All other” requesters: Charges which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing responsive records (if any) beyond the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time which will be furnished without charge.

      (j)  A requester or associated requesters may not file a series of multiple requests, which are merely discrete subdivisions of the information actually sought for the purpose of avoiding or reducing applicable fees. In such instances, NACIC may aggregate the requests and charge the applicable fees.

      § 1800.14   Fee estimates (pre-request option).

#### § § 1800.14

      In order to avoid unanticipated or potentially large fees, a requester may submit a request for a fee estimate. Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, NACIC will endeavor within twenty (20) days to provide an accurate estimate, and, if a request is thereafter submitted, NACIC will not accrue or charge fees in excess of our estimate without the specific permission of the requester.

    Subpart C—NACIC Action On FOIA Requests

      § 1800.21   Processing of requests for records.

#### § § 1800.21

      (a)  Requests meeting the requirements of §§ 1800.11 through 1800.13 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and these regulations. Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, upon receipt, NACIC shall within twenty (20) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the NACIC components reasonably believed to hold responsive records.

      (b)  As an alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many requesters, NACIC maintains a database of “officially released information” which contains copies of documents released by NACIC. Searches of this database can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any, costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate in their correspondence. Consistent with the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, on-line electronic access to these records is available to the public. Detailed information regarding such access is available from the point of contact specified in § 1800.3.

      (c)  In processing a request, NACIC shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 and may jeopardize intelligence sources or methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, NACIC, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.

      (d)  Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, NACIC will utilize every effort to determine within the statutory guideline of twenty (20) days after receipt of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However, should the volume of requests require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to § 1800.33, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination.

      § 1800.22   Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.

#### § § 1800.22

      (a)  (1) NACIC components tasked pursuant to a FOIA request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance. They shall:

      (i) Determine whether a record exists;

      (ii) Determine whether and to what extent any FOIA exemptions apply;

      (iii) Approve the disclosure of all non-exempt records or portions of records for which they are the originator; and

      (iv) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or interested party.

      (2) In making these decisions, the NACIC component officers shall be guided by the applicable law as well as the procedures specified at § 1800.31 and § 1800.32 regarding confidential commercial information and personal information (about persons other than the requester).

      (b)  As applicable and within twenty (20) days, pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, of receipt by the Coordinator, any NACIC records containing information originated by other NACIC components shall be forwarded to those entities for action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies or NACIC records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies within twenty (20) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to NACIC (for NACIC records).

      § 1800.23   Payment of fees, notification of decision, and right of appeal.

#### § § 1800.23

      (a)  Fees collected under this part do not accrue to the National Counterintelligence Center and shall be deposited immediately to the general account of the United States Treasury.

      (b)  Upon completion of all required review and the receipt of accrued fees (or promise to pay such fees), NACIC will promptly inform the requester in writing of those records or portions of records which may be released and which must be denied. With respect to the former, NACIC will provide copies; with respect to the latter, NACIC shall explain the reasons for the denial, identify the person(s) responsible for such decisions by name and title, and give notice of a right of administrative appeal.

      (c)  As an alternative to receiving records by mail, a requester may arrange to inspect the records deemed releasable at a NACIC “reading room” in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Access will be granted after applicable and accrued fees have been paid. Requests to review or browse documents in our database of “officially released records” will also be honored in this manner to the extent that paper copies or electronic copies in unclassified computer systems exist. All such requests shall be in writing and addressed pursuant to § 1800.3. The records will be available at such times as mutually agreed but not less than three (3) days from our receipt of a request. The requester will be responsible for reproduction charges for any copies of records desired.

    Subpart D—Additional Administrative Matters

      § 1800.31   Procedures for business information.

#### § § 1800.31

      (a)  Business information obtained by NACIC by a submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      means commercial or financial information in which a legal entity has a recognized property interest;

      means such business information provided to the United States Government by a submitter which is reasonably believed to contain information exempt from release under exemption (b)(4) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm;

      means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the United States Government; it includes, but is not limited to, corporations, businesses (however organized), state governments, and foreign governments; and

      (b)  A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be confidential commercial information and hence protected from required disclosure pursuant to exemption (b)(4). Such designations shall expire ten (10) years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.

      (c) —(1)  NACIC shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a Freedom of Information Act request encompassing business information whenever:

      (i) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential commercial information, or

      (ii) NACIC believes that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, and

      (iii) The information was submitted within the last ten (10) years unless the submitter requested and provided acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration.

      (2)  This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the confidential commercial information at issue or provide copies of the responsive records containing such information.

      (3)  (i) Within seven (7) days of the above notice, all claims of confidentiality by a submitter must be supported by a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall:

      (A) Specify that the information has not been disclosed to the public;

      (B) Explain why the information is contended to be a trade secret or confidential commercial information;

      (C) Explain how the information is capable of competitive damage if disclosed;

      (D) State that the submitter will provide NACIC and the Department of Justice with such litigation defense as requested; and

      (E) Be certified by an officer authorized to legally bind the corporation or similar entity.

      (ii) It should be noted that information provided by a submitter pursuant to this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (4)  (i) NACIC shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to its final determination. If NACIC decides to disclose a document over the objection of a submitter, NACIC shall provide the submitter a written notice which shall include:

      (A) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;

      (B) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

      (C) A specified disclosure date which is seven (7) days after the date of the instant notice.

      (ii) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, NACIC shall also notify the requester and, if NACIC notifies a submitter that it intends to disclose information, then the requester shall be notified also and given the proposed date for disclosure.

      (5)  If a requester initiates a civil action seeking to compel disclosure of information asserted to be within the scope of this section, NACIC shall promptly notify the submitter. The submitter, as specified above, shall provide such litigation assistance as required by NACIC and the Department of Justice.

      (6)  The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if NACIC determines that:

      (i) The information should not be disclosed in light of other FOIA exemptions;

      (ii) The information has been published lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;

      (iii) The disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law or federal regulation; or

      (iv) The designation made by the submitter under this section appears frivolous, except that, in such a case, NACIC will, within a reasonable time prior to the specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.

      § 1800.32   Procedures for information concerning other persons.

#### § § 1800.32

      (a)  Personal information concerning individuals other than the requester shall not be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act if the proposed release would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      means any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information.

      means the public interest in understanding the operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply any matter which might be of general interest to the requester or members of the public.

      (b)  In making the required determination under this section and pursuant to exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA, NACIC will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested information.

      (c)  A requester seeking information on a third person is encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third person waiving all or some of their privacy rights. However, all such waivers shall be narrowly construed and the Coordinator, in the exercise of his discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.

      § 1800.33   Allocation of resources; agreed extensions of time.

#### § § 1800.33

      (a)  NACIC components shall devote such personnel and other resources to the responsibilities imposed by the Freedom of Information Act as may be appropriate and reasonable considering:

      (1) The totality of resources available to the component,

      (2) The business demands imposed on the component by the Director of NACIC or otherwise by law,

      (3) The information review and release demands imposed by the Congress or other governmental authority, and

      (4) The rights of all members of the public under the various information review and disclosure laws.

      (b)  Components shall exercise due diligence in their responsibilities under the FOIA and must allocate a reasonable level of resources to requests under the Act in a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis and utilizing two or more processing queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., project) cases receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the NACIC-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law. The Director, NACIC shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary and render decisions on administrative appeals.

      (c)  When NACIC is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, it will inform the requester that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limits, provide an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed within the statutory time limits, or arrange with the requester an agreed upon time frame for processing the request, or determine that exceptional circumstances mandate additional time in accordance with the definition of “exceptional circumstances” per section 552(a)(6)(C) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, effective October 2, 1997. In such instances NACIC will, however, inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.

      § 1800.34   Requests for expedited processing.

#### § § 1800.34

      (a)  All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis. Exceptions to this section will only be made in accordance with the following procedures. In all circumstances, however, and consistent with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or other federal, state, or foreign judicial or quasi-judicial rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Privacy Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.

      (b)  Requests for expedited processing will be approved only when a compelling need is established to the satisfaction of NACIC. A requester may make such a request with a certification of “compelling need” and, within ten (10) days of receipt, NACIC will decide whether to grant expedited processing and will notify the requester of its decision. The certification shall set forth with specificity the relevant facts upon which the requester relies and it appears to NACIC that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable. A “compelling need” is deemed to exist:

      (1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.

    Subpart E—NACIC Action On FOIA Administrative Appeals

      § 1800.41   Appeal authority.

#### § § 1800.41

      The Director, NACIC will make final NACIC decisions from appeals of initial adverse decisions under the Freedom of Information Act and such other information release decisions made under parts 1801, 1802, and 1803 of this chapter. Matters decided by the Director, NACIC will be deemed a final decision by NACIC.

      § 1800.42   Right of appeal and appeal procedures.

#### § § 1800.42

      (a)  A right of administrative appeal exists whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request for a fee waiver is denied. NACIC will apprise all requesters in writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the Director, NACIC through the Coordinator.

      (b)  Appeals of decisions must be received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of NACIC's initial decision. NACIC may, for good cause and as a matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals shall be in writing and addressed as specified in § 1800.3. All appeals must identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with specificity and may present such information, data, and argument in support as the requester may desire.

      (c)  No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of a review within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.

      (d)  NACIC shall promptly record each request received under this part, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office(s) which originated or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal.

      (e)  NACIC shall attempt to complete action on an appeal within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt. The volume of requests, however, may require that NACIC request additional time from the requester pursuant to § 1800.33. In such event, NACIC will inform the requester of the right to judicial review.

      § 1800.43   Determination(s) by Office Chief(s).

#### § § 1800.43

      Each Office Chief in charge of an office which originated or has an interest in any of the records subject to the appeal, or designee, is a required party to any appeal; other interested parties may become involved through the request of the Coordinator when it is determined that some or all of the information is also within their official cognizance. These parties shall respond in writing to the Coordinator with a finding as to the exempt status of the information. This response shall be provided expeditiously on a “first-in, first-out” basis taking into account the business requirements of the parties and consistent with the information rights of members of the general public under the various information review and release laws.

      § 1800.44   Action by appeals authority.

#### § § 1800.44

      § 1801.11   Preliminary information.

#### § § 1801.11

      Members of the public shall address all communications to the contact specified at § 1801.3 and clearly delineate the communication as a request under the Privacy Act and this regulation. Requests and administrative appeals on requests, referrals, and coordinations received from members of the public who owe outstanding fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and action on existing requests and appeals will be terminated in such circumstances.

      § 1801.12   Requirements as to form.

#### § § 1801.12

      (a)  No particular form is required. All requests must contain the identification information required at § 1801.13.

      (b)  For requests seeking access, a requester should, to the extent possible, describe the nature of the record sought and the record system(s) in which it is thought to be included. Requesters may find assistance from information described in the Privacy Act Issuances Compilation which is published biennially by the  In lieu of this, a requester may simply describe why and under what circumstances it is believed that NACIC maintains responsive records; NACIC will undertake the appropriate searches.

      (c)  For requests seeking amendment, a requester should identify the particular record or portion subject to the request, state a justification for such amendment, and provide the desired amending language.

      § 1801.13   Requirements as to identification of requester.

#### § § 1801.13

      (a)  Individuals seeking access to or amendment of records concerning themselves shall provide their full (legal) name, address, date and place of birth, and current citizenship status together with a statement that such information is true under penalty of perjury or a notarized statement swearing to or affirming identity. If NACIC determines that this information is not sufficient, NACIC may request additional or clarifying information.

      (b)  Only aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence (PRAs) may file a request pursuant to the Privacy Act and this part. Such individuals shall provide, in addition to the information required under paragraph (a) of this section, their Alien Registration Number and the date that status was acquired.

      (d)  If a requester or representative fails to provide the information in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section within forty-five (45) days of the date of our request, NACIC will deem the request closed. This action, of course, would not prevent an individual from refiling his or her Privacy Act request at a subsequent date with the required information.

      § 1801.14   Fees.

#### § § 1801.14

      No fees will be charged for any action under the authority of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, irrespective of the fact that a request is or may be processed under the authority of both the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.

    Subpart C—Action On Privacy Act Requests

      § 1801.21   Processing requests for access to or amendment of records.

#### § § 1801.21

      (a)  Requests meeting the requirements of § 1801.11 through § 1801.13 shall be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the applicable regulations, unless the requester demands otherwise in writing. Such requests will be processed under both Acts regardless of whether the requester cites one Act in the request, both, or neither. This action is taken in order to ensure the maximum possible disclosure to the requester.

      (b)  Upon receipt of a request meeting the requirements of §§ 1801.11 through 1801.13, NACIC shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office(s) reasonably believed to hold responsive records.

      (c)  In processing a request, NACIC shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 and that confirmation of the existence of a record may jeopardize intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, NACIC, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.

      (d)  Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the NACIC should provide a response within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the volume of requests may require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to § 1801.33. In such event, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal.

      § 1801.22   Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.

#### § § 1801.22

      (a)  NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a Privacy Act access request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance. They shall:

      (1) Determine whether responsive records exist;

      (2) Determine whether access must be denied in whole or part and on what legal basis under both Acts in each such case;

      (3) Approve the disclosure of records for which they are the originator; and

      (4) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or interested party as well as the specific determinations with respect to denials (if any).

      (b)  NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a Privacy Act amendment request shall review the official records alleged to be inaccurate and the proposed amendment submitted by the requester. If they determine that NACIC's records are not accurate, relevant, timely or complete, they shall promptly:

      (1) Make the amendment as requested;

      (2) Write to all other identified persons or agencies to whom the record has been disclosed (if an accounting of the disclosure was made) and inform of the amendment; and

      (3) Inform the Coordinator of such decisions.

      (c)  If the NACIC office records manager declines to make the requested amendment (or declines to make the requested amendment) but agrees to augment the official records, that manager shall promptly:

      (1) Set forth the reasons for refusal; and

      (2) Inform the Coordinator of such decision and the reasons therefore.

      (d)  As applicable and within ten (10) days of receipt by the Coordinator, any NACIC records containing information originated by other NACIC offices shall be forwarded to those entities for action in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies or NACIC records containing other federal information shall be forwarded to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other NACIC records) or return to NACIC (for NACIC records).

      (e)  This section shall not be construed to allow access to systems of records exempted by the Director, NACIC pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act or where those exemptions require that NACIC can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of responsive records.

      § 1801.23   Notification of decision and right of appeal.

#### § § 1801.23

      Within ten (10) days of receipt of responses to all initial taskings and subsequent coordinations (if any), and dispatch of referrals (if any), NACIC will provide disclosable records to the requester. If a determination has been made not to provide access to requested records (in light of specific exemptions) or that no records are found, NACIC shall so inform the requester, identify the denying official, and advise of the right to administrative appeal.

    Subpart D—Additional Administrative Matters

      § 1801.31   Special procedures for medical and psychological records.

#### § § 1801.31

      (a)  When a request for access or amendment involves medical or psychological records and when the originator determines that such records are not exempt from disclosure, NACIC will, after consultation with the Director of Medical Services, CIA, determine:

      (1) Which records may be sent directly to the requester and

      (2) Which records should not be sent directly to the requester because of possible medical or psychological harm to the requester or another person.

      (b)  In the event that NACIC determines, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that records should not be sent directly to the requester, NACIC will notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician:

      (1) To review the documents with the requesting individual,

      (2) To explain the meaning of the documents, and

      (3) To offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction, NACIC will forward such records to the designated physician.

      (c)  If within sixty (60) days of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the requester has failed to respond or designate a physician, or the physician fails to agree to the release conditions, NACIC will hold the documents in abeyance and advise the requester that this action may be construed as a technical denial. NACIC will also advise the requester of the responsible official and of his or her rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review.

      § 1801.32   Requests for expedited processing.

#### § § 1801.32

      (a) All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in circumstances that NACIC deems to be exceptional. In making this determination, NACIC shall consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following factors:

      (1) That there is a genuine need for the records; and

      (2) That the personal need is exceptional; and

      (3) That there are no alternative forums for the records sought; and

      (4) That it is reasonably believed that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable.

      (b) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of exceptional urgency and extraordinary need. In accordance with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or equivalent state rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Freedom of Information Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.

      § 1801.33   Allocation of resources; agreed extensions of time.

#### § § 1801.33

      (a)  NACIC components shall devote such personnel and other resources to the responsibilities imposed by the Privacy Act as may be appropriate and reasonable considering:

      (1) The totality of resources available to the component,

      (2) The business demands imposed on the component by the Director, NACIC or otherwise by law,

      (3) The information review and release demands imposed by the Congress or other governmental authority, and

      (4) The rights of all members of the public under the various information review and disclosure laws.

      (b)  Offices shall exercise due diligence in their responsibilities under the Privacy Act and must allocate a reasonable level of resources to requests under the Act in a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis and utilizing two or more processing queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., project) cases receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the NACIC-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law. The Director, NACIC shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary and shall render decisions on administrative appeals.

      (c)  While the Privacy Act does not specify time requirements, our joint treatment of requests under the FOIA means that when NACIC is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, NACIC may request additional time from a requester. In such instances NACIC will inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.

    Subpart E—Action On Privacy Act Administrative Appeals

      § 1801.41   Appeal authority.

#### § § 1801.41

      The Director, NACIC will make final NACIC decisions from appeals of initial adverse decisions under the Privacy Act and such other information release decisions made under 32 CFR parts 1800, 1802, and 1803 of this chapter.

      § 1801.42   Right of appeal and appeal procedures.

#### § § 1801.42

      (a)  A right of administrative appeal exists whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request for amendment is denied. NACIC will apprise all requesters in writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the Director, NACIC through the Coordinator.

      (b)  Appeals of decisions must be received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of NACIC's initial decision. NACIC may, for good cause and as a matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals to the Director, NACIC shall be in writing and addressed as specified in § 1801.3. All appeals must identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with specificity, provide the desired amending language (if applicable), and may present such information, data, and argument in support as the requester may desire.

      (c)  No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of an administrative review within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.

      (d)  NACIC shall promptly record each administrative appeal, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office chief in charge of the office(s) which originated or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal.

      § 1801.43   Determination(s) by Office Chiefs.

#### § § 1801.43

These parties shall respond in writing to the Coordinator with a finding as to the exempt or non-exempt status of the information including citations to the applicable exemption and/or their agreement or disagreement as to the requested amendment and the reasons therefore. Each response shall be provided expeditiously on a “first-in, first-out” basis taking into account the business requirements of the parties and consistent with the information rights of members of the general public under the various information review and release laws.

#### § § 1801.44

      (a)  The Coordinator shall provide a summation memorandum for consideration of the Director, NACIC; the complete record of the request consisting of the request, the document(s) (sanitized and full text) at issue, and the findings of any concerned office chiefs or designee(s).

      (b)  The Director, NACIC shall personally decide each case; no personal appearances shall be permitted without the express permission of the Director, NACIC.
