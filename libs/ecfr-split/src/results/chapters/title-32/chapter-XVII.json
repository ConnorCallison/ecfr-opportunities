The ODNI components ordinarily will include records in their possession as of the date that they begin their search unless the request specifically included an end date for the search. If another date is used, the IRRG staff will inform the requester of the date used and the reason for its use. The potentially responsive records will be sent to IRRG staff for responsiveness review and application of relevant exemptions, if any.\n",
              "(c) When reviewing responsive records, ODNI will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the agency will ordinarily proceed in one of the following ways:\n",
              "(1) When the record originates with ODNI but contains information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, ODNI will typically consult with that other agency or office prior to making a release determination.\n",
              "(2) When ODNI believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, ODNI typically will refer the record to that agency and ask that agency to respond to the requester concerning that record (provided the other agency is subject to FOIA).\n",
              "(i) Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if ODNI and the originating agency jointly agree that ODNI is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n",
              "(ii) If another agency accepts responsibility for responding to a particular record, ODNI will notify the requester of the referral. When appropriate and available, the notice will include a point of contact for the other agency.\n",
              "(3) The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For instance, if ODNI locates within its file's materials originating with another Intelligence Community element, and the involvement of that element in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then disclosing or attributing the involvement of that Intelligence Community element could cause damage to the national security. In such an instance, and to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, ODNI will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosure of the record. ODNI will then inform the requester of the release determination.\n",
              "(d) When a request is made for information that is classified, ODNI must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. When a request involves a record containing classified information that has been classified by another agency, ODNI will refer that portion of the request to the agency that originated the information, or has the primary interest in it, as appropriate. Similarly, when a record contains information that ODNI has derivatively classified (for example, when ODNI's classification is based on information originally classified by another agency), ODNI must refer that portion of the request to the agency that originally classified the underlying information.\n",
              "(e) ODNI will notify the requester of its determination to grant, deny, or refer the FOIA request. ODNI will release reasonably segregable, non-exempt information. For any adverse determination—including those regarding any disputed fee matter; a denial of a request for a fee waiver; a determination to withhold a record in whole or in part; a determination that a record does not exist or cannot be located; or a denial of a request for expedited processing—the notice will include the following information:\n",
              "(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the determination to deny the request in whole or in part;\n",
              "(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied in denying the request. The notice will indicate, if feasible, the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which a deletion is made on the released portion of the record, unless including that information would harm an interest protected by the exemption;\n",
              "(3) An estimate of the volume of information withheld, if applicable, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. Such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption;\n",
              "(4) A statement that the adverse determination may be appealed and a description of the requirements for an appeal; and\n",
              "(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the FOIA Public Liaison, and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.\n\n\n\n\n"

              "(e) ODNI may toll the 20-day time frame set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for one of the two reasons cited below, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii). If ODNI tolls the time frame, the tolling period ends upon receipt of the requester's response.\n",
              "(1) Once, to await information that the ODNI has reasonably requested from the requester; or\n",
              "(2) As necessary, to clarify with the requester issues regarding the fee assessment.\n",
              "(f) Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and ODNI extends the time limit on that basis, ODNI will notify the requester in writing, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 days, ODNI shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing. ODNI shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose and notify the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.\n",
              "(g) For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, ODNI may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. ODNI will notify the requester(s) of the decision to aggregate.\n",
              "(h) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve a compelling need. For this purpose, a “compelling need” involves either:\n",
              "(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or\n",
              "(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.\n",
              "(i) A request for expedited processing must be in writing and may be made at any time.\n",
              "(j) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. Under this paragraph (h), a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—an urgency that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, ODNI may waive the formal certification requirement.\n",
              "(k) The IMO will decide within 10 days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny such a request. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.\n\n\n\n\n"

If a fee waiver or reduction in fees is requested, the requester must demonstrate that a waiver or reduction in fees is in the public interest because disclosure of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the requester's commercial interest. After processing, actual fees must exceed $25.00 for ODNI to require payment of fees. Appeals should be resolved prior to the initiation of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests will be accepted at any time prior to ODNI's decision regarding the request, except when processing has been initiated.\n",

In the absence of a national security basis for exemption, records in this system may be exempted from access and amendment to the extent necessary to honor promises of confidentiality to persons providing information concerning a candidate for position.

Counterterrorism investigations necessarily rely on information obtained from third parties rather than information furnished by subjects themselves.\n",
                  "(6) From paragraph (e)(3) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (provide Privacy Act Statement to subjects furnishing information) because the system is exempted from requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of the Privacy Act to collect information directly from the subject.\n",

Nevertheless, ODNI has published notice concerning notification, access, and contest procedures because it may in certain circumstances determine it appropriate to provide subjects access to all or a portion of the records about them in a system of records.\n",
                  "(8) From paragraph (e)(4)(I) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (identifying sources of records in the system of records) because identifying sources could result in disclosure of properly classified national defense or foreign policy information, intelligence sources and methods, and investigatory techniques and procedures. Notwithstanding its exemption from this requirement, ODNI identifies record sources in broad categories sufficient to provide general notice of the origins of the information it maintains in its systems of records.\n",

In addition, in collecting information for counterterrorism, intelligence, and law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time and the development of additional facts and circumstances, seemingly irrelevant or dated information may acquire significance. The restrictions imposed by paragraph (e)(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) would limit the ability of intelligence analysts to exercise judgment in conducting investigations and impede development of intelligence necessary for effective counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts.\n",
