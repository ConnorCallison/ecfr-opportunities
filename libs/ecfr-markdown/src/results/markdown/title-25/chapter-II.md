    The use of Government trade-marks in an unauthorized manner, or the colorable imitation of such marks, is subject to the criminal penalties imposed by section 5 of the said act (49 Stat. 892; 25 U.S.C. 305d), which provides:

    § 308.2   Certificates of genuineness to be attached to trade-marks.

#### § § 308.2

    (a) To insure the widest distribution of genuine Indian handicraft products, and to protect the various enterprises organized by individual Indian craftsmen, or by groups of Indian craftsmen, for the purpose of the production and sale of such handicraft products, the Indian Arts and Crafts Board offers each such enterprise the privilege of attaching to its trademark a certificate declaring that it is recognized by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board as an Indian enterprise dealing in genuine Indian-made handicraft products, and that its trade-mark has the approval of the Board.

  PART 309—PROTECTION OF INDIAN ARTS AND CRAFTS PRODUCTS

### Part 309

**Authority:** Authority: 18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 U.S.C. 305

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 54555, Oct. 21, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

    § 309.1   How do the regulations in this part carry out the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990?

#### § § 309.1

    These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 U.S.C. 305 ) from false representations, and specify how the Indian Arts and Crafts Board will interpret certain conduct for enforcement purposes. The Act makes it unlawful to offer or display for sale or sell any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian, or Indian tribe, or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the United States.

    § 309.2   What are the key definitions for purposes of the Act?

#### § § 309.2

    (a)  as applied to an individual means a person who is a member of an _Indian_ tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the provisions of § 309.4).

    (b)  means an individual who is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member _Indian artisan_.

    (c)  means any legally established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members of Indian tribes.

    (d) —(1)  The term “_Indian product_” means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the term “made by an Indian” means that an Indian has provided the artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the Indian art or craft object to be an “Indian product.”

    (2)  The term “Indian product” includes, but is not limited to:

    (i) Art made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;

    (ii) Craft work made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;

    (iii) Handcraft made by an Indian,  an object created with the help of only such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape and design of each individual product.

    (3)  An “Indian product” under the Act does not include any of the following, for example:

    (i) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product made by non-Indian labor;

    (ii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is designed by an Indian but produced by non-Indian labor;

    (iii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is assembled from a kit;

    (iv) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product originating from a commercial product, without substantial transformation provided by Indian artistic or craft work labor;

    (v) Industrial products, which for this purpose are defined as goods that have an exclusively functional purpose, do not serve as a traditional artistic medium, and that do not lend themselves to Indian embellishment, such as appliances and vehicles. An industrial product may not become an Indian product.

    (vi) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is produced in an assembly line or related production line process using multiple workers not all whom are Indians. For example, if twenty people make up the labor to create the product(s), and one person is not Indian, the product is not an “Indian product.”

    (e)  means—

    (1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or

    (2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.

    (f)  means that the origin of a product is identified as a named Indian tribe or named Indian arts and crafts organization.

> [61 FR 54555, Oct. 21, 1996; 61 FR 57002, Nov. 5, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 35169, June 12, 2003]

    § 309.6   When does a commercial product become an Indian product?

#### § § 309.6

    In addressing Indian embellishments to originally commercial products, the Indian labor expended to add art or craft work to those objects must be sufficient to substantially transform the qualities and appearance of the original commercial item. “Commercial products,” under this part, are consumer goods designed for profit and mass distribution that lend themselves to Indian embellishment, for example clothing and accessories. Through substantial transformation due to Indian labor, a product changes from a commercial product to an Indian product. Examples of formerly commercial products that become Indian products include tennis shoes to which an Indian applies beadwork and denim jackets to which an Indian applies ribbon appliqués.

> [68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]

    § 309.7   How should a seller disclose the nature and degree of Indian labor when selling, offering, or displaying art and craft work for sale?

#### § § 309.7

    The Indian Arts and Crafts Act is a truth-in-marketing law. Those who produce and market art and craft work should honestly represent and clarify the degree of Indian involvement in the production of the art and craft work when it is sold, displayed or offered for sale. The following guidelines illustrate the way in which art and craft work may be characterized for marketing purposes and gives examples of products that may be marketed as Indian products.

> [68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]

    § 309.8   For marketing purposes, what is the recommended method of identifying authentic Indian products?

#### § § 309.8

    (a) The recommended method of marketing authentic Indian products is to include the name of the artist or artisan, the name of the Tribe in which the artist or artisan is enrolled, and the individual's Tribal enrollment number. If the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan, rather than an enrolled Tribal member, the product identification should include the name of the Tribe providing official written certification that the individual is a non-member Indian artisan and the date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe. In order for an individual to be certified by an Indian Tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, the individual must be of Indian lineage of one or more members of such Indian Tribe and the certification must be issued in writing by the governing body of an Indian Tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function by the governing body of the Indian Tribe.

    (b) For example, the Indian product should include a label, hangtag, provenance card, or similar identification that includes W (name of the artist or artisan), and X (name of the Tribe in which the individual is enrolled) and Y (individual's Tribal enrollment number), or a statement that the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan of Z (name of the Tribe providing certification and the date upon which the certification was issued by the Tribe).

> [68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]

    § 309.9   When can non-Indians make and sell products in the style of Indian arts and crafts?

#### § § 309.9

    A non-Indian can make and sell products in the style of Indian art or craft products only if the non-Indian or other seller does not falsely suggest to consumers that the products have been made by an Indian.

> [68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]

    § 309.10   What are some sample categories and examples of Indian products?

#### § § 309.10

    What constitutes an Indian product is potentially very broad. However, to provide guidance to persons who produce, market, or purchase items marketed as Indian products, §§ 309.11 through 309.22 contain a sample listing of “specific examples” of objects that meet the definition of Indian products. There is some repetition, due to the interrelated nature of many Indian products when made by Indian artistic labor. The lists in these sections contain examples and are not intended to be all-inclusive. Additionally, although the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and the Indian Arts and Crafts Enforcement Act of 2000 do not address materials used in Indian products, some materials are included for their descriptive nature only. This is not intended to restrict materials used or to exclude materials not listed.
