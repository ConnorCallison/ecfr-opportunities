      § 660.10   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 660.10

      (a) Subparts C through G of this part implement the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (PCGFMP) developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Subparts C through G govern fishing vessels of the U.S. in the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. All weights are in round weight or round-weight equivalents, unless specified otherwise.

      (b) Any person fishing subject to subparts C through G of this part is bound by the international boundaries described in this section, notwithstanding any dispute or negotiation between the U.S. and any neighboring country regarding their respective jurisdictions, until such time as new boundaries are established or recognized by the U.S.

      § 660.11   General definitions.

#### § § 660.11

      These definitions are specific to the fisheries covered in subparts C through G of this part.

      means a harvest specification that is set below the overfishing limit to account for scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL, and other scientific uncertainty.

      means the portion of the groundfish fleet in which an observer coverage plan is being applied.

      means the business address a person has provided to NMFS for NMFS use in providing notice of agency actions and other business with that person.

      ( § 600.10 of this chapter)

      is a harvest specification set equal to or below the ABC threshold in consideration of conservation objectives, socioeconomic concerns, management uncertainty and other factors. The ACL is a harvest limit that includes all sources of fishing-related mortality including landings, discard mortality, research catches, and catches in exempted fishing permit activities. Sector-specific annual catch limits can be specified, especially in cases where a sector has a formal, long-term allocation of the harvestable surplus of a stock or stock complex.

      is a management target set below the annual catch limit and may be used as an accountability measure in cases where there is great uncertainty in inseason catch monitoring to ensure against exceeding an annual catch limit. Since the annual catch target is a target and not a limit it can be used in lieu of harvest guidelines or strategically to accomplish other management objectives. Sector-specific annual catch targets can also be specified to accomplish management objectives.

      means any manufactured or man-made non-scented/non-flavored (regardless if scent or flavor is added in the manufacturing process or added afterwards) device complete with hooks, intended to attract fish. _Artificial lure_s include, but are not limited to: spoons, spinners, artificial flies, and plugs. Artificial lures are made of metal, plastic, wood, or other non-edible materials.

      (natural or artificial) means any substance which attracts fish. Natural bait includes any natural biological substance used to attract or catch fish ( herring/fish eggs). Artificial bait includes any manufactured device used to attract or catch fish.

      means a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit described at § 660.25(b)(3)(i), subpart C, registered for use with a vessel that meets the permit length endorsement requirements appropriate to that vessel, as described at § 660.25(b)(3)(iii), subpart C.

      means a 24-month period beginning at 0001 local time on January 1 and ending at 2400 local time on December 31 of the subsequent year.

      means the biomass level that produces maximum sustainable yield (*MSY*), as stated in the PCGFMP at Section 4.3.

      means the day beginning at 0001 hours local time and continuing for 24 consecutive hours.

      ( “fishing year”)

      ( § 600.10 of this chapter)

      means an individual that is certified by NMFS, is deployed to a first receiver, and whose primary duties include: monitoring and verification of the sorting of fish relative to Federal requirements defined in § 660.60(h)(6); documentation of the weighing of such fish relative to the requirements of § 660.13(b); and verification of first receivers' reporting relative to the requirements defined in § 660.113(b)(4).

      means the Catch Monitor Program Office of the West Coast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service.

      means any person that is granted a permit by NMFS to provide certified catch monitors as required in § 660.140.

      means the addition of a new shareholder or partner to the corporate or partnership membership. This definition of a “change” will apply to any person added to the corporate or partnership membership since November 1, 2000, including any family member of an existing shareholder or partner. A change in membership is not considered to have occurred if a member dies or becomes legally incapacitated and a trustee is appointed to act on his behalf, nor if the ownership of shares among existing members changes, nor if a member leaves the corporation or partnership and is not replaced. Changes in the ownership of publicly held stock will not be deemed changes in ownership of the corporation.

      means, when referring to closure of a fishery or a closed fishery, that taking and retaining, possessing, or landing the particular species or species group covered by the fishing closure is prohibited. Unless otherwise announced in the  or authorized in this subpart, offloading must begin before the closure time.

      means:

      (1) Fishing by a person who possesses a commercial fishing license or is required by law to possess such license issued by one of the states or the Federal Government as a prerequisite to taking, landing and/or sale of fish; or

      (2) Fishing that results in or can be reasonably expected to result in sale, barter, trade or other disposition of fish for other than personal consumption.

      means the fishery harvest guideline minus the estimated recreational catch. Limited entry and open access allocations are derived from the commercial harvest guideline.

      means an enclosed geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees latitude and longitude where NMFS may prohibit fishing with particular gear types. Conservation areas include Groundfish Conservation Areas (GCA), Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Areas (EFHCA) and Deep-sea Ecosystem Conservation Areas (DECA).

      (1)  or  means a conservation area created or modified and enforced to control catch of groundfish or protected species. Regulations at § 660.60(c)(3) describe the various purposes for which NMFS may implement certain types of _GCA_s through routine management measures. Regulations at § 660.70 further describe and define coordinates for certain GCAs, including: Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Areas; Cowcod Conservation Areas; Groundfish Exclusion Areas; waters encircling the Farallon Islands; and waters encircling the Cordell Bank. GCAs also include closures bounded by the EEZ or depth-based lines approximating depth contours, including Bycatch Reduction Areas or BRAs, or bounded by depth contours and lines of latitude, including Block Area Closures, or BACs, and Rockfish Conservation Areas, or RCAs, which may be closed to fishing with particular gear types. BRA, BAC, and RCA boundaries may change seasonally according to conservation needs. Regulations at §§ 660.71 through 660.74, and § 660.76 define depth-based boundary lines with latitude/longitude coordinates that may be used to enact depth-based closures. Regulations in this section describe commonly used geographic coordinates that define lines of latitude. Fishing prohibitions associated with GCAs are in addition to those associated with other conservation areas.

      (i)  or  are bounded on the north and south by commonly used geographic coordinates defined in this section, and on the east and west by the EEZ, and boundary lines approximating depth contours, defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.71 through 660.74 (10 fm (18 m) through 250 fm (457 m)), and § 660.76 (700 fm (1,280 m)). _BACs_ may be implemented or modified as routine management measures, per the provisions of § 660.60(c). BACs may be implemented to control catch of groundfish by vessels taking and retaining groundfish in the EEZ seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California for vessels using any gear type (trawl or non-trawl). BACs may be implemented to minimize bycatch of Chinook salmon and coho salmon by bottom trawl or midwater trawl vessels in the EEZ seaward of Oregon and California, and by midwater trawl vessels in the EEZ seaward of Washington, but shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 250 fm (457 m) depth contour as defined in § 660.74. BACs may vary in their geographic boundaries, duration, and the gears to which they apply. Their geographic boundaries, applicable gear type(s) and/or specific fishery program, and effective dates will be announced in the  BACs may be implemented within tribal Usual and Accustomed fishing areas but may only apply to non-tribal vessels. BACs may have a specific termination date as described in the  or may be in effect until modified. BACs that are in effect until modified by NMFS are set out in the trip limit tables of subparts D through F of this part.

      (ii)  or  are conservation areas that apply to vessels using midwater groundfish trawl gear during the Pacific whiting primary season, as described at §§ 660.60(d) and 660.131(c).

      (iv)  are defined at § 660.70.

      (v)  are closed areas intended to mitigate potential impacts to sensitive environments from certain groundfish fishing activity. GEAs may prohibit fishing by certain groundfish sectors or certain groundfish gear types. Geographic coordinates for GEAs are defined at § 660.70.

      (vi)  RCA restrictions are detailed in subparts D through G of this part. RCAs may apply to a single gear type or to a group of gear types such as “trawl RCAs” or “non-trawl RCAs.” Specific latitude and longitude coordinates for RCA boundaries that approximate the depth contours selected for trawl, non-trawl, and recreational RCAs are provided in §§ 660.71 through 660.74. Also provided in §§ 660.71 through 660.74, are references to islands and rocks that serve as reference points for the RCAs.

      (A)  The Trawl RCAs are intended to protect a complex of species, such as overfished shelf rockfish species, and have boundaries defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates approximating depth contours. Boundaries for the limited entry Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in table 1a (North) subpart D of this part. Boundaries for the open access non-groundfish Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in § 660.333(e). Boundaries of the Trawl RCAs may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (B)  Non-Trawl RCAs are intended to protect a complex of species, such as overfished shelf rockfish species, and have boundaries defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates approximating depth contours. Boundaries for the Non-Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in tables 2a (North) and 2a (South) of subpart E of this part and tables 3a (North) and 3a (South) of subpart F of this part and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (C)  Recreational RCAs are closed areas intended to protect overfished rockfish species. In the EEZ seaward of California, recreational RCAs are also intended to limit catch of non-overfished groundfish species. Recreational RCAs may either have boundaries defined by general depth contours or boundaries defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates approximating depth contours. Boundaries for the recreational RCAs throughout the year are provided in the text in subpart G of this part under each state (Washington, Oregon and California) and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (vii)  or  are defined at § 660.70.

      (2)  or  means an area created and enforced to contribute to the protection of groundfish essential fish habitat. Regulations at §§ 660.75 through 660.79 define _EFHCA_ boundaries. Fishing prohibitions associated with EFHCAs, which are found at §§ 660.12, 660.112, 660.212, and 660.312, are in addition to those prohibitions associated with other conservation areas.

      (3)  or  is the area within the EEZ deeper than 3,500 m (1,914 fm) that is not designated as EFH, defined at § 660.75 with latitude and longitude coordinates. The _DECA_ is closed to bottom contact gear for the reasons described under MSA Section 303(b), and contributes to the protection of deep-water habitats including deep-sea corals. Fishing prohibitions associated with DECAs, at § 660.12, are in addition to those associated with other conservation areas.

      § 660.13   Recordkeeping and reporting.

#### § § 660.13

      (a) This subpart recognizes that catch and effort data necessary for implementing the PCGFMP are collected by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California under existing state data collection requirements.

      (1)  In the absence of a state trawl logbook requirement based on the port of landing, the authorized representative of the commercial trawl fishing vessel registered to a limited entry permit with a trawl gear endorsement participating in the Shorebased IFQ Program groundfish trawl fisheries must keep and submit a complete and accurate record of fishing activities in the trawl logbook form. The following requirements apply:

      (i) The authorized representative of the vessel must keep the trawl logbook form on board the vessel while engaged in, or returning from, all Shorebased IFQ Program trips using groundfish trawl gear, and must immediately surrender the logbook form upon demand to NMFS or other authorized officers.

      (ii) The authorized representative of the vessel must complete the trawl logbook form on all Shorebased IFQ Program trips using groundfish trawl gear, with all available information, except for information not yet ascertainable, prior to entering port. The logbook form must be completed as soon as the information becomes available. The information on the logbook form will include at a minimum: Vessel name, vessel trip start and end dates, crew size, tow start, tow completion, location of tow, average depth of catch, net type, target strategy, and estimated retained pounds by species.

      (iii) The authorized representative of the vessel must deliver the NMFS copy of the trawl logbook form by mail or in person to NMFS or its agent. The authorized representative of the vessel must transmit the logbook form on or before the 10th day of each month following the month to which the records pertain.

      (iv) The authorized representative of the vessel responsible for submitting the trawl logbook forms must maintain a copy of all submitted logbooks for up to three years after the fishing activity ended.

      (2)  The authorized representative of a commercial vessel participating in the below list of groundfish fishery sectors must keep and submit a complete and accurate record of fishing activities in the non-trawl electronic logbook application:

      (i) The directed open access fishery, as defined at § 660.11;

      (ii) The limited entry fixed gear trip limit fisheries subject to the trip limits in tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) to subpart E of this part, and primary sablefish fisheries, as defined at § 660.211; and

      (iii) Gear switching in the Shorebased IFQ Program, as defined at § 660.140(k).

      (3)  The non-trawl electronic logbook application is a web-based portal used to send data from non-trawl fishing trips to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. The following requirements apply:

      (i) The authorized representative of the vessel must complete an entry in the non-trawl electronic logbook application for all groundfish fishing trips, as defined under § 660.11. Required information for each fishing trip includes, but is not limited to, information on set-level data on catch, discards, fishing location, fishing depth, gear configuration, and sale.

      (ii) The authorized representative of the vessel must complete an entry for each groundfish fishing trip in the non-trawl electronic logbook application with valid responses for all data fields in the application, except for information not yet ascertainable, prior to entering port, subject to the following requirements:

      (A)  Logbook entries for setting gear, including vessel information, gear specifications, set date/time/location, must be completed within 2 hours of setting each piece of string or gear. The authorized representative of each vessel may record or document this information in a format outside of the electronic logbook application ( waterproof paper). All logbook information whether recorded inside or outside of the electronic application must be available for immediate review by at-sea authorized law enforcement personnel.

      (B)  Logbook entries for retrieving gear, including date/time recovered and catch/discard information, must be completed within 4 hours of retrieving each piece of string or gear. The authorized representative of each vessel may record or document this information in a format outside of the electronic logbook application ( waterproof paper). All logbook information whether recorded inside or outside of the electronic application must be available for immediate review by at-sea authorized law enforcement personnel.

      (C)  The authorized representative of the vessel must complete and submit entries in the non-trawl electronic logbook application within 24 hours of the completion of offload, including information under subparagraphs A and B that was captured but not recorded in the electronic logbook application while fishing.

      (iii) If no fish are retained or discarded on a fishing trip, then a non-trawl logbook submission is not required for that fishing trip.

      (b) Any person who is required to do so by the applicable state law must make and/or file, retain, or make available any and all reports ( logbooks, state landing receipts, etc.) of groundfish harvests and landings containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable state law.

      (c) Any person landing groundfish must retain on board the vessel from which groundfish is landed, and provide to an authorized officer upon request, copies of any and all reports of groundfish landings containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable state law throughout the cumulative limit period during which a landing occurred and for 15 days thereafter.

      (d)  When the operator of a vessel registers a VMS unit with NMFS OLE, the vessel operator must provide NMFS with a declaration report as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section. The operator of any vessel that has already registered a VMS unit with NMFS OLE but has not yet made a declaration, as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, must provide NMFS with a declaration report upon request from NMFS OLE.

      (1)  The operator of any vessel registered to a limited entry permit must provide NMFS OLE with a declaration report, as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, before the vessel leaves port on a trip in which the vessel is used to fish in U.S. ocean waters between 0 and 200 nm offshore of Washington, Oregon, or California.

      (i) Limited entry trawl vessels fishing in the Shorebased IFQ Program must provide NMFS OLE with a new declaration report each time a different groundfish trawl gear (bottom or midwater only) is fished. The declaration may be made from sea and must be made to NMFS before a different type (bottom or midwater only) of groundfish trawl gear is fished.

      (ii) Limited entry midwater trawl vessels targeting Pacific whiting may change their declarations while at sea between the Pacific whiting shorebased IFQ sector and the mothership sector as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section. The declaration must be made to NMFS before a different sector is fished.

      (2)  The operator of any vessel that is not registered to a limited entry permit and which uses non-groundfish trawl gear to fish in the EEZ (3-200 nm offshore), must provide NMFS OLE with a declaration report, as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, before the vessel leaves port to fish in the EEZ.

      (3)  (all types of open access gear other than non-groundfish trawl gear). The operator of any vessel that is not registered to a limited entry permit or is registered to a directed open access permit, must provide NMFS with a declaration report, as specified at paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, before the vessel leaves port on a trip in which the vessel is used to take and retain or possess groundfish in the EEZ or land groundfish taken in the EEZ.

      (4)  (i) The operator of a vessel specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section must provide a declaration report to NMFS OLE prior to leaving port on the first trip in which the vessel meets the requirement specified at § 660.14(b) to have a VMS.

      (ii) A declaration report will be valid until another declaration report revising the existing gear, monitoring, or fishery, declaration is received by NMFS OLE. The vessel operator must send a new declaration report before leaving port on a trip that meets one of the following criteria:

      (A) A gear type that is different from the gear type most recently declared for the vessel will be used, or

      (B) A monitoring type that is different from the monitoring type most recently declared for the vessel will be used, or

      (C) A vessel will fish in a fishery other than the fishery most recently declared.

      (iii) During the period of time that a vessel has a valid declaration report on file with NMFS OLE, it cannot fish with a gear and monitoring type other than a gear type and monitoring type declared by the vessel or fish in a fishery other than the fishery most recently declared.

      (iv) Declaration reports will include: The vessel name and/or identification number, gear type, and monitoring type where applicable, (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section). Upon receipt of a declaration report, NMFS will provide a confirmation code or receipt to confirm that a valid declaration report was received for the vessel. Retention of the confirmation code or receipt to verify that a valid declaration report was filed and the declaration requirement was met is the responsibility of the vessel owner or operator. Vessels using non-trawl gear may declare more than one gear type, with the exception of vessels participating in the Shorebased IFQ Program ( gear switching) and those vessels declaring to fish inside the Non-Trawl RCA with non-bottom contact stationary vertical jig gear or groundfish troll gear ( if one of these declarations is used, no other declaration may be made on that fishing trip). For the purpose of the directed open access permit defined at § 660.65, declaration codes for the directed open access fishery include codes 33 through 37. Vessels using trawl gear may only declare one of the trawl gear types listed in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section on any trip and may not declare non-trawl gear on the same trip in which trawl gear is declared.

      (A) One of the following gear types or sectors, and monitoring type where applicable, must be declared:

      () Limited entry fixed gear, not including shorebased IFQ (declaration code _1_0);

      () Limited entry groundfish non-trawl, shorebased IFQ, observer (declaration code 11);

      § 660.14   Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) requirements.

#### § § 660.14

      (a)  A VMS consists of a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver unit that automatically determines the vessel's position and transmits it to a NMFS OLE type-approved communications service provider. The communications service provider receives the transmission and relays it to NMFS OLE.

      (b)  The following vessels are required to install a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver unit and to arrange for a NMFS OLE type-approved communications service provider to receive and relay transmissions to NMFS OLE prior to fishing:

      (1) Any vessel registered for use with a limited entry “A” endorsed permit (, not an MS permit) that fishes in state or Federal waters seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured off the States of Washington, Oregon or California (0-200 nm offshore).

      (2) Any vessel that uses non-groundfish trawl gear to fish in the EEZ.

      (3) Any vessel that uses open access gear to take and retain, or possess groundfish in the EEZ or land groundfish taken in the EEZ.

      (c)

      (1) NMFS OLE will publish type-approval specifications for VMS components in the  or notify the public through other appropriate media.

      (2) Mobile transceiver unit manufacturers or communication service providers will submit products or services to NMFS OLE for evaluation based on the published specifications.

      (3) NMFS OLE may publish a list of NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver units and communication service providers for the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery in the  or notify the public through other appropriate media. As necessary, NMFS OLE may publish amendments to the list of type-approved mobile transceiver units and communication service providers in the  or through other appropriate media. A list of VMS transceivers that have been type-approved by NMFS OLE may be mailed to the permit owner's address of record. NMFS will bear no responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS, as required at § 660.25(b)(4)(i)(B).

      (d)  If you are a vessel owner that must participate in the VMS program, you or the vessel operator must:

      (1) Obtain a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver unit and have it installed on board your vessel in accordance with the instructions provided by NMFS OLE. You may obtain a copy of the VMS installation and operation instructions from the NMFS OLE West Coast Region, VMS Program Manager upon request at 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone: 888-585-5518 or

      (2) Activate the mobile transceiver unit, submit an activation report at least 72 hours prior to leaving port on a trip in which VMS is required, and receive confirmation from NMFS OLE that the VMS transmissions are being received before participating in a fishery requiring the VMS. Instructions for submitting an activation report may be obtained from the NMFS OLE West Coast Region, VMS Program Manager upon request at 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone: 888-585-5518 or  An activation report must again be submitted to NMFS OLE following reinstallation of a mobile transceiver unit or change in service provider before the vessel may be used to fish in a fishery requiring the VMS.

      (i)  If you are a vessel owner who must use VMS and you are activating a VMS transceiver unit for the first time or reactivating a VMS transceiver unit following a reinstallation of a mobile transceiver unit or change in service provider, you must fax NMFS OLE an activation report that includes: Vessel name; vessel owner's name, address and telephone number, vessel operator's name, address and telephone number, USCG vessel documentation number/state registration number; if applicable, the groundfish permit number the vessel is registered to; VMS transceiver unit manufacturer; VMS communications service provider; VMS transceiver identification; identifying if the unit is the primary or backup; and a statement signed and dated by the vessel owner confirming compliance with the installation procedures provided by NMFS OLE.

      (ii)  Ownership of the VMS transceiver unit may be transferred from one vessel owner to another vessel owner if all of the following documents are provided to NMFS OLE: A new activation report, which identifies that the transceiver unit was previously registered to another vessel; a notarized bill of sale showing proof of ownership of the VMS transceiver unit; documentation from the communications service provider showing proof that the service agreement for the previous vessel was terminated and that a service agreement was established for the new vessel.

      (3) Operate and maintain the mobile transceiver unit in good working order continuously, 24 hours a day throughout the fishing year, unless such vessel is exempted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

      (i)  The mobile transceiver unit must transmit a signal accurately indicating the vessel's position at least once every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, throughout the year unless an exemption in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section applies or a valid exemption report, as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, has been received by NMFS OLE. The signal indicating the vessel's position can consist of either: A single position report transmitted every 15 minutes; or a series of position reports, at no more than a 15 minute interval, combined and transmitted at least once every hour.

      (ii) —(A)  If a vessel has an electronic monitoring system installed and in use for the duration of a given fishing year, the mobile transceiver unit must transmit a signal at least once every hour.

      (B)  If a limited entry trawl vessel is fishing with midwater trawl gear under declarations in § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A), the mobile transceiver unit must transmit a signal at least once every hour.

      (C)  If a vessel remains in port for an extended period of time, the mobile transceiver unit must transmit a signal at least once every four hours. The mobile transceiver unit must remain in continuous operation at all times unless the vessel is exempt under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

      (D)  If a vessel is fishing for pink shrimp using non-groundfish trawl gear under declarations in § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A), the mobile transceiver unit must transmit a signal at least once every hour.

      (4)  A vessel that is required to operate and maintain the mobile transceiver unit continuously 24 hours a day throughout the fishing year may be exempted from this requirement if a valid exemption report, as described at paragraph (d)(4)(ix) of this section, is received by NMFS OLE and the vessel is in compliance with all conditions and requirements of the VMS exemption identified in this section and specified in the exemption report.

      (i)  When it is anticipated that a vessel will be continuously out of the water for more than 7 consecutive days and a valid exemption report has been received by NMFS OLE, electrical power to the VMS mobile transceiver unit may be removed and transmissions may be discontinued. Under this exemption, VMS transmissions can be discontinued from the time the vessel is removed from the water until the time that the vessel is placed back in the water.

      (ii)  When the vessel will be operating seaward of the EEZ off Washington, Oregon, or California continuously for more than 7 consecutive days and a valid exemption report has been received by NMFS OLE, the VMS mobile transceiver unit transmissions may be reduced or discontinued from the time the vessel leaves the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon or California until the time that the vessel re-enters the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon or California. Under this exemption, the vessel owner or operator can request that NMFS OLE reduce or discontinue the VMS transmissions after receipt of an exemption report, if the vessel is equipped with a VMS transceiver unit that NMFS OLE has approved for this exemption.

      (iii)  If a limited entry permit had a change in vessel registration so that it is no longer registered to the vessel (for the purposes of this section, this includes permits placed into “unidentified” status); or if a directed open access permit has not yet been renewed, NMFS may exempt the vessel from VMS requirements providing the vessel is not used in a fishery requiring VMS off the States of Washington, Oregon, or California (0-200 nm (5.6-370.4 km) offshore) for the remainder of the fishing year.

      (iv)  A vessel participating in the open access fishery that is required to have VMS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions after the end of the fishing year in which it used non-groundfish trawl gear, providing the vessel submits a completed exemption report signed by the vessel owner that includes a statement signed by the vessel owner indicating that the vessel will not use non-groundfish trawl gear to fish in the EEZ during the new fishing year. A vessel participating in the open access fishery that is required to have VMS under paragraph (b)(3) of this section also may be exempted from VMS provisions after the end of the fishing year in which it fished in the open access fishery, providing the vessel submits a completed exemption report signed by the vessel owner that includes a statement signed by the vessel owner indicating that the vessel will not be used to take and retain or possess groundfish in the EEZ or land groundfish taken in the EEZ during the new fishing year.

      (v)  When it is anticipated that a vessel will be without power or in a maintenance condition for more than 4 consecutive hours, preventing operation of the vessel's VMS unit, and if a valid exemption report has been received by NMFS OLE, electrical power to the VMS mobile transceiver unit may be removed and transmissions may be discontinued. Under this exemption, VMS transmissions can be discontinued from the time the vessel is in the maintenance condition until the time the maintenance is completed.

      (vi)  When a new vessel owner purchases a vessel with VMS and does not intend to participate in an activity requiring VMS, but the previous vessel owner had not received a VMS exemption prior to the sale, VMS transmissions may be discontinued by the new vessel owner. Under this exemption, VMS transmissions can be discontinued indefinitely, upon purchase of the vessel, and no subsequent VMS transmissions will be required unless the new vessel owner engages in an activity requiring VMS.

      (vii)  Vessels required to have VMS under paragraph (b) of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions in emergency situations that are beyond the vessel owner's control, including but not limited to: Fire, flooding, or extensive physical damage to critical areas of the vessel. A vessel owner may apply for an emergency exemption from the VMS requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section for his/her vessel by sending a written request to NMFS OLE specifying the following information: The reasons for seeking an exemption, including any supporting documents ( repair invoices, photographs showing damage to the vessel, insurance claim forms, ); the time period for which the exemption is requested; and the location of the vessel while the exemption is in effect. NMFS OLE will issue a written determination granting or denying the emergency exemption request. A vessel will not be covered by the emergency exemption until NMFS OLE issues a determination granting the exemption. If an exemption is granted, the duration of the exemption will be specified in the NMFS OLE determination.

      (viii)  Signed long-term departure exemption reports must be submitted by fax or by emailing an electronic copy of the actual report. In the event of an emergency in which an emergency exemption request will be submitted, initial contact with NMFS OLE must be made by telephone, fax or email within 24 hours from when the incident occurred. Emergency exemption requests must be requested in writing within 72 hours from when the incident occurred. Maintenance exemption requests must include signed written documentation of the work being done and the name of the company doing the work, if applicable. Sale of Vessel exemption requests must include documentation of purchase of the vessel by the new owner. Other exemption reports must be submitted through the VMS or another method that is approved by NMFS OLE and announced in the  Submission methods for exemption requests, except maintenance, sale of vessel, long-term departures and emergency exemption requests, may include email, facsimile, or telephone. NMFS OLE will provide, through appropriate media, instructions to the public on submitting exemption reports. Instructions and other information needed to make exemption reports may be mailed to the vessel owner's address of record. NMFS will bear no responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record for the vessel owner and is not received because the vessel owner's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS. Owners of vessels required to use VMS who do not receive instructions by mail are responsible for contacting NMFS OLE during business hours at least 3 days before the exemption is required to be submitted to obtain information needed to make exemption reports. NMFS OLE must be contacted during business hours (Monday through Friday between 0800 and 1700 Pacific Time).

      (ix)  For an exemption report to be valid, it must be received by NMFS at least 2 hours and not more than 24 hours before the exempted activities defined at paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section occur. An exemption report is valid until NMFS receives a report canceling the exemption. An exemption cancellation must be received at least 2 hours before the vessel re-enters the EEZ following an outside areas exemption; at least 2 hours before the vessel is placed back in the water following a haul out exemption; at least 2 hours before the vessel operates following a maintenance exemption; at least 2 hours before the vessel resumes fishing for a species of fish or with gear requiring VMS in state or Federal waters off the States of Washington, Oregon, or California after it has received a permit exemption; or at least 2 hours before a vessel resumes fishing in the open access fishery after a long-term departure exemption. If a vessel is required to submit an activation report under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section before returning to fish, that report may substitute for the exemption cancellation. Initial contact must be made with NMFS OLE not more than 24 hours after the time that an emergency situation occurred in which VMS transmissions were disrupted and followed by a written emergency exemption request within 72 hours from when the incident occurred. If the emergency situation upon which an emergency exemption is based is resolved before the exemption expires, an exemption cancellation must be received by NMFS at least 2 hours before the vessel resumes fishing.

      (5) When aware that transmission of automatic position reports has been interrupted, or when notified by NMFS OLE that automatic position reports are not being received, contact NMFS West Coast Region, VMS Program Manager upon request at 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone: 888-585-5518 or  and follow the instructions provided to you. Such instructions may include, but are not limited to, manually communicating to a location designated by NMFS OLE the vessel's position or returning to port until the VMS is operable.

      (6) After a fishing trip during which interruption of automatic position reports has occurred, the vessel's owner or operator must replace or repair the mobile transceiver unit prior to the vessel's next fishing trip. Repair or reinstallation of a mobile transceiver unit or installation of a replacement, including change of communications service provider shall be in accordance with the instructions provided by NMFS OLE and require the same certification.

      (7) Make the mobile transceiver units available for inspection by NMFS OLE personnel, USCG personnel, state enforcement personnel or any authorized officer.

      (8) Ensure that the mobile transceiver unit is not tampered with, disabled, destroyed, operated, or maintained improperly.

      (9) Pay all charges levied by the communication service provider as necessary to ensure continuous operation of the VMS transceiver units.

      § 660.15   Equipment requirements.

#### § § 660.15

      (a)  This section contains the equipment and operational requirements for scales used to weigh catch at sea, scales used to weigh catch at IFQ first receivers, hardware and software for electronic fish tickets, and computer hardware for electronic logbook software. Unless otherwise specified by regulation, the operator or manager must retain, for 3 years, a copy of all records described in this section and make the records available upon request to NMFS staff or an authorized officer.

      (b)  Vessel owners, operators, and managers are jointly and severally responsible for their vessel's compliance with the requirements specified in this section.

      (1)  A scale used to weigh fish in the MS and C/P Co-op Programs must meet the type evaluation, initial inspection, and annual reinspection requirements set forth in 50 CFR 679.28(b)(1) and (2), and must be approved by NMFS to weigh fish at sea.

      (2)  Once a scale is installed on a vessel and approved by NMFS for use to weigh fish at sea, it must be reinspected annually within 12 months of the date of the most recent inspection to determine if the scale meets all of the applicable performance and technical requirements as described in 50 CFR 679.28(b).

      (3)  Each scale used to weigh fish must be tested at least once each calendar day to ensure that each scale meets the maximum permissible error requirements described at paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (4)  To verify that the scale meets the maximum permissible errors specified in this paragraph, each scale used to weigh fish must be tested at least one time during each calendar day when use of the scale is required. The tests must be performed in an accurate and timely manner.

      (i) —(A)  The maximum permissible errors for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus 3 percent of the known weight of the test material.

      (B)  A test must be conducted by weighing no less than 400 kg (882 lb) of test material, supplied by the scale manufacturer or approved by a NMFS-authorized scale inspector, on the scale under test. The test material may be run across the scale multiple times in order to total 400 kg; however, no single run of test material across the scale may weigh less than 40 kg (88.2 lb). The known weight of test material must be determined at the time of each scale test by weighing it on a platform scale approved for use under 50 CFR 679.28(b)(7).

      (ii) —(A)  The maximum permissible errors for the daily at-sea scale test for platform scales is plus or minus 0.5 percent of the weight tested.

      (B)  A platform scale used for observer sampling must be tested at 10, 25, and 50 kg (or 20, 50, and 100 lb if the scale is denominated in pounds) using approved test weights. Any combination of test weights that will allow the scale to be tested at 10 kg, 25 kg, and 50 kg may be used. A platform scale used to weigh fish must be tested at a weight equal to the largest amount of fish that will be weighed on the scale in one weighing.

      (C)  Each test weight must have its weight stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each test weight must be annually certified by a National Institute of Standards and Technology-approved metrology laboratory or approved for continued use by the NMFS authorized inspector at the time of the annual scale inspection.

      (iii)  The following conditions must be met:

      (A) Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before the time that the test will be conducted, and conduct the test while the observer is present.

      (B) Conduct the scale test by placing the test material or test weights on or across the scale and recording the following information on the at-sea scale test report form:

      () Vessel name;

      () Month, day, and year of test;

      () Time test started to the nearest minute in local time;

      () Known weight of test materials or test weights;

      () Weight of test material or test weights recorded by scale;

      () Percent error as determined by subtracting the known weight of the test material or test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, dividing that amount by the known weight of the test material or test weights, and multiplying by 100; and

      () Signature of operator.

      (C) Maintain the scale test report form from all at-sea scale tests, including test report forms from failed scale tests on board the vessel until the end of the fishing year during which the tests were conducted, and make the report forms available to observers, NMFS staff, or authorized officers. In addition, the scale test report forms must be retained for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during which the tests were performed. Each scale test report form must be signed by the operator immediately following completion of each scale test.

      (5)  The scale must be maintained in proper operating condition throughout its use; adjustments made to the scale must be made to bring the performance errors as close as practicable to a zero value; and no adjustment may be made that will cause the scale to weigh fish inaccurately.

      (6)  (not applicable to observer sampling scales). Printed reports are provided to NMFS as required by this paragraph. _Printed reports from the scale_ must be maintained on board the vessel until the end of the year during which the reports were made, and made available to observers, NMFS staff or authorized officers. In addition, printed reports must be retained for 3 years after the end of the year during which the printouts were made.

      (i)  Reports must be printed at least once every calendar day when use of the scale is required. Reports must also be printed before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced. Scale weights must not be adjusted by the scale operator to account for the perceived weight of water, slime, mud, debris, or other materials. Scale printouts must show:

      (A) The vessel name and Federal vessel permit number;

      (B) The date and time the information was printed;

      (C) The haul number;

      (D) The total weight of the haul; and

      (E) The total cumulative weight of all fish and other material weighed on the scale since the last annual inspection.

      (ii)  The printed report must include the information specified in sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and 4.3.1.8 of appendix A to 50 CFR part 679. The printed report must be provided to the authorized scale inspector at each scale inspection and must also be printed at any time upon request of the observer, NMFS personnel or an authorized officer.

      (iii)  The operator must print the calibration log on request by NMFS staff or an authorized officer, or person authorized by NMFS. The calibration log must be printed and retained before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced. The calibration log must detail either the prior 1,000 calibrations or all calibrations since the scale electronics were first put into service, whichever is less. The printout from the calibration log must show:

      (A) The vessel name and Federal fisheries or processor permit number;

      (B) The month, day, and year of the calibration;

      (C) The time of the calibration to the nearest minute in local time;

      (D) The weight used to calibrate the scale; and

      (E) The magnitude of the calibration in comparison to the prior calibration.

      (iv)  The operator must print the fault log on request by NMFS staff, an authorized officer or person authorized by NMFS. The fault log must be printed and retained before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced. The fault log must detail either the prior 1,000 faults and startups, or all faults and startups since the scale electronics were first put into service, whichever is less. A fault, for the purposes of the fault log, is any condition other than underflow detected by the scale electronics that could affect the metrological accuracy of the scale. The printout from the fault log must show:

      (A) The vessel name and Federal fisheries or processor permit number;

      (B) The month, day, year, and time of each startup to the nearest minute in local time;

      (C) The month, day, year, and time that each fault began to the nearest minute in local time; and

      (D) The month, day, year, and time that each fault was resolved to the nearest minute in local time.

      (v)  A platform scale used for observer sampling is not required to produce a printed record.

      (7)  Mothership or Catcher/Processor vessels required to weigh fish under the regulations in this section must provide and maintain a NMFS-approved video monitoring system as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (c)  Scale requirements in this paragraph are in addition to those requirements set forth by the State in which the scale is located, and nothing in this paragraph may be construed to reduce or supersede the authority of the State to regulate, test, or approve scales within the State. Scales used to weigh fish that are also required to be approved by the State must meet the following requirements:

      (1)  The scale must display a valid sticker indicating that the scale is currently approved in accordance with the laws of the state where the scale is located.

      (2)  The IFQ first receiver must ensure that the scale and scale display are visible simultaneously to the catch monitor. Catch monitors, NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers must be allowed to observe the weighing of fish on the scale and be allowed to read the scale display at all times.

      (3)

      (i) An IFQ first receiver must ensure that printouts of the scale weight of each delivery or offload are made available to the catch monitor, NMFS staff, to NMFS-authorized personnel, or to authorized officers at the time printouts are generated. An IFQ first receiver must maintain printouts on site until the end of the fishing year during which the printouts were made and make them available upon request by the catch monitor, NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during which the printout was made.

      (ii) All scales identified in a catch monitoring plan (see § 660.140(f)(3)) must produce a printed record for each landing, or portion of a landing, weighed on that scale. NMFS may exempt, through approval of the NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan, scales not designed for automatic bulk weighing from part or all of the printed record requirements. IFQ first receivers that receive no more than 200,000 pounds of groundfish in any calendar month may be exempt under § 660.140(j)(2). For scales that must produce a printed record, the printed record must include:

      (A) The IFQ first receiver's name;

      (B) The weight of each load in the weighing cycle;

      (C) The total weight of fish in each landing, or portion of the landing that was weighed on that scale;

      (D) For belt scales and weight belts, the total cumulative weight of all fish or other material weighed on the scale since the last inspection;

      (E) The date the information is printed; and

      (F) The name and vessel registration or documentation number of the vessel making the landing. The person operating the scale may write this information on the scale printout in ink at the time of printing.

      (4)  IFQ first receivers must allow, and provide reasonable assistance to NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, and authorized officers to test scales used to weigh IFQ fish. A scale that does not pass an inseason test may not be used to weigh IFQ fish until the scale passes an inseason test or is approved for continued use by the weights and measures authorities of the State in which the scale is located.

      (i)  To pass an inseason test, NMFS staff or authorized officers must be able to verify that:

      (A) The scale display and printed information are clear and easily read under all conditions of normal operation;

      (B) Weight values are visible on the display until the value is printed;

      (C) The scale does not exceed the maximum permissible errors specified in this paragraph:

      ()  The maximum permissible error is plus or minus 0.25 percent of the known weight of the test material with repeatability between tests of no more than 0.25 percent. Percent error is determined by subtracting the known weight of the test material or test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, dividing that amount by the known weight of the test material or test weights, and multiplying by _1_00.

      ()

      (D)  An automatic weighing system must be provided and operational that will prevent fish from passing over the scale or entering any weighing hopper unless the following criteria are met:

      (ii) Review of any conflict of interest as described in § 660.18(c)(3).

      (iii) Review of any criminal convictions.

      (iv) Satisfactory performance ratings on any Federal contracts held by the applicant.

      (v) Review of any history of decertification as an observer, catch monitor, observer provider, or catch monitor provider.

      (3)  (i) Providers must not have a direct financial interest, other than the provision of observer, catch monitor or other biological sampling services, in any federal or state managed fisheries, including but not limited to:

      (A) Any ownership, mortgage holder, or other secured interest in a vessel, first receiver, shorebased or floating stationary processor facility involved in the catching, taking, harvesting or processing of fish;

      (B) Any business involved with selling supplies or services to any vessel, first receiver, shorebased or floating stationary processing facility; or

      (C) Any business involved with purchasing raw or processed products from any vessel, first receiver, shorebased or floating stationary processing facilities.

      (ii) Providers must not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gratuity, gift, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from any person who conducts fishing or fish processing activities that are regulated by NMFS, or who has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the official duties of the provider.

      (4)  Businesses that provided observers and/or catch monitors in the 12 months prior to May 21, 2015 will be issued a provider permit without submission of an application. This permit will be effective through December 31, 2015.

      (i) Providers who deployed catch monitors in the Shorebased IFQ Program in the 12 months prior to May 21, 2015 will be issued a provider permit with a catch monitor provider endorsement effective through December 31, 2015, except that a change in ownership of an existing catch monitor provider after January 1, 2015, requires a new permit application under this section.

      (ii) Providers who deployed certified observers in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery in the 12 months prior to May 21, 2015 will be issued a provider permit with an observer provider endorsement effective through December 31, 2015, except that a change in ownership of an existing observer provider after January 1, 2015, requires a new permit application under this section.

      (iii) To receive a provider permit for 2016 and beyond, the existing providers must follow the provider permit renewal process set forth in this section.

      (d)

      (1)  For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if it disapproves the application. An approved application will result in issuance of the permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (2)  The applicant may appeal the IAD consistent with the observer, catch monitor, and provider appeals process defined at § 660.19.

      (e)  The provider permit will be valid from the effective date identified on the permit until the permit expiration date of December 31. Provider permit holders must reapply annually by following the application process specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (f) —(1)  After a period of 12 continuous months during which no observers or catch monitors are deployed by the provider in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery, NMFS will issue an IAD describing the intent to expire the provider permit or to remove the appropriate endorsement(s) and the timeline to do so. A provider that receives an IAD may appeal under § 660.19. The provider permit and endorsements will remain valid until a final agency decision is made or until December 31, whichever is earlier.

      (2)  Failure to renew annually will result in expiration of the provider permit and endorsements on December 31.

      (3)  A person holding an expired or void permit or endorsement may reapply for a new provider permit or endorsement at any time consistent with § 660.18(b).

      (g)  To maintain a valid provider permit, provider permit holders must reapply annually prior to the permit expiration date.

      (1) NMFS will mail a provider permit application form to existing permit holders on or about September 15 each year.

      (2) Providers who want to have their permits effective for January 1 of the following calendar year must submit their complete application form to NMFS by October 31. If a provider fails to renew the provider permit, the provider permit and endorsements will expire on December 31.

      (h)  Neither a provider permit nor the endorsements are transferable. Ownership of a provider permit cannot be registered to another individual or entity. The provider permit owner cannot change, substitute, or add individuals or entities as owners of the permit ( cannot change the legal name of the permit owner(s) as given on the permit). Any change in ownership of the provider permit requires the new owner(s) to apply for a provider permit, and is subject to approval by NMFS.

      (i)  Procedures governing sanctions of permits are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

      (j)  The Regional Administrator may charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to issuance of permits including initial issuance, renewal replacement, and appeals.

      § 660.19   Appeals process for catch monitors, observers, and provider permits.

#### § § 660.19

      (a)  This section describes the procedure for appealing IADs described at §§ 660.17(g), 660.18(d) and (f), 660.140(h), 660.150(j), 660.160(g), 660.603(b)(3) for catch monitor decertification, observer decertification, provider permit expirations due to inactivity, and EM service provider permit denials. Any person whose interest is directly and adversely affected by an IAD may file a written appeal. For purposes of this section, such person will be referred to as the “applicant.”

      (b) In cases where the applicant disagrees with the IAD, the applicant may appeal that decision. Final decisions on appeals of IADs will be made in writing by the Regional Administrator or designee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce and will state the reasons therefore.

      (1)  (i) The appeal must be in writing and comply with this paragraph.

      (ii) Appeals must be mailed or faxed to: National Marine Fisheries Service, West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, ATTN: Appeals, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115; Fax: 206-526-6426; or delivered to National Marine Fisheries Service at the same address.

      (2)  The appeal must be filed within 30 calendar days after the IAD is issued. The IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator or designee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce if no appeal is filed within 30 calendar days. The time period to submit an appeal begins with the date on the IAD. If the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the next business day.

      (3)  The address used by the applicant in initial correspondence to NMFS concerning the application will be the address used by NMFS for the appeal. Notifications and correspondence associated with all actions affecting the applicant will be mailed to the address of record unless the applicant provides NMFS, in writing, an address change. NMFS bears no responsibility if NMFS sends a notification or correspondence to the address of record and it is not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS.

      (4)  Applicants must submit a full written statement in support of the appeal, including a concise statement of the reasons the IAD determination has a direct and adverse effect on the applicant and should be reversed or modified. The appellate officer will limit his/her review to the issues stated in the appeal; all issues not set out in the appeal will be waived.

      (5)  The Regional Administrator or designee will issue a final written decision on the appeal which is the final decision of the Secretary of Commerce.

      § 660.20   Vessel and gear identification.

#### § § 660.20

      (a) —(1)  The operator of a vessel that is over 25 ft (7.6 m) in length and is engaged in commercial fishing for groundfish must display the vessel's official number on the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, and on a weather deck so as to be visible from above. The number must contrast with the background and be in block Arabic numerals at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) high for vessels over 65 ft (19.8 m) long and at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) high for vessels between 25 and 65 ft (7.6 and 19.8 m) in length. The length of a vessel for purposes of this section is the length set forth in USCG records or in state records, if no USCG record exists.

      (2)  The operator of a vessel engaged in commercial fishing for groundfish must keep the identifying markings required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section clearly legible and in good repair, and must ensure that no part of the vessel, its rigging, or its fishing gear obstructs the view of the official number from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.

      (3)  This section does not apply to vessels carrying fishing parties on a per-capita basis or by charter.

      (b)  Gear identification requirements specific to fisheries using fixed gear (limited entry and open access) are described at § 660.219, subpart E and § 660.319, subpart F.

      § 660.21   Seabird Avoidance Program.

#### § § 660.21

      This section contains the requirements of the Seabird Avoidance Program.

      (a)  The purpose of the Seabird Avoidance Program is to minimize interactions between fishing gear and seabird species, including short-tailed albatross ().

      (b)  The requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section apply to the following fishing vessels when operating within the EEZ north of 36° N latitude:

      (1) Vessels greater than or equal to 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA engaged in commercial fishing for groundfish with bottom longline gear, including snap gear, as defined under “Fishing gear” in § 660.11, including those operating under the gear switching provisions of the Limited Entry Trawl Fishery, Shorebased IFQ Program as specified in § 660.140(k), or those operating under the limited entry fixed gear fishery in subpart E or under the open access fishery in subpart F of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section.

      (2)  The requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, as described at § 660.50, or to anglers engaged in recreational fishing for groundfish, as described in Subpart G of this Part.

      (c) —(1)  The operator of a vessel described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must comply with the following requirements, unless operating under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section:

      (i)  Have onboard the vessel seabird avoidance gear meeting the material standards specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and in accordance to the vessel size and gear type specific requirements as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  Upon request by an authorized officer or observer, make the seabird avoidance gear available for inspection.

      (iii)  Use seabird avoidance gear as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that meets the material standards specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section while bottom longline and snap gears are being deployed.

      (iv)  All streamer lines must:

      (A) Have streamers spaced every 16.4 ft (5 m).

      (B) Have individual streamers that hang attached to the mainline to 9.8 in (0.25 m) above the waterline in the absence of wind.

      (C) Have streamers constructed of material that is brightly colored, UV-protected plastic tubing or   inch (9.5 mm) polyester line or material of an equivalent density.

      (v)  If a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel, owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:

      (A) Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the bird on board the vessel using a dip net;

      (B) Determine if the bird is alive or dead.

      (C) If alive, follow these instructions:

      () Cover the bird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils or damage while being handled;

      () Remove any entangled lines or hooks from the bird without further injuring the bird;

      () Place the bird in a safe enclosed place;

      () If the hook has been ingested or is inaccessible, keep the bird in a safe, enclosed place and submit it to NMFS or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service immediately upon the vessel's return to port. Do not give the bird food or water.

      () Assess whether the bird meets the following criteria for release:

      () Able to hold _i_ts head erect and respond to noise and motion stimuli;

      () Able to breathe without noise;

      () Capable of flapping and retracting both wings to normal folded position on its back;

      () Able to stand on both feet with toes pointed forward; and

      () Feathers are dry.

      () If bird does not meet criteria for release:

      () Immed_i_ately contact NMFS or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on the West Coast Seabird Avoidance Measures flyer and request veterinary guidance;

      () Follow the veterinary guidance regarding the handling and release of the bird.

      (D) If dead, freeze the bird immediately with an identification tag attached directly to the specimen listing the species, location and date of mortality, and band number if the bird has a leg band. Attach a duplicate identification tag to the bag or container holding the bird. Any leg bands present must remain on the bird. Contact NMFS or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on the West Coast Seabird Avoidance Measures flyer, inform them that you have a dead short-tailed albatross on board, and submit the bird to NMFS or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within 72 hours following completion of the fishing trip.

      (E) All incidents involving the hooking of short-tailed albatross must be reported to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement by the vessel operator within 72 hours of taking an albatross by phoning 360-753-7764 (WA); 503-682-6131 (OR); or 916-414-6660 (CA).

      (F) If a NMFS observer is on board at the time of a hooking event, the observer shall be responsible for the disposition of any captured short-tailed albatross and for reporting to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement. Otherwise, the vessel operator shall be responsible.

      (2)  The operator of a vessel identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must comply with the following gear requirements:

      (i) For vessels with masts, poles, or rigging using snap gear as defined at § 660.11, the following requirements apply:

      (A) Vessels must deploy a minimum of a single streamer line in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.

      (B) Streamer lines must be a minimum length of 147.6 ft (45 m).

      (C) Streamer lines must be deployed so that streamers are in the air a minimum of 65.6 ft (20 m) aft of the stern and within 6 ft 7 in (2 m) horizontally of the point where the main groundline enters the water before the first hook is set. A minimum of 4 streamers must be out of the water aft of the stern.

      (ii) For vessels with masts, poles, or rigging using bottom longline other than snap gear, as defined in paragraph (6)(i) of the definition of fishing gear in § 660.11, the following requirements apply:

      (A) Streamer lines must be a minimum length of 300 feet (91.4 m).

      (B) The number of streamer lines required and the streamer line deployment requirements vary by vessel length as follows:

      () Vessels greater than or equal to 26 feet (7.9 m) and less than 55 feet (_1_6.8 m) LOA must use a minimum of one streamer line. Streamer line must be deployed before the first hook is set in such a way that streamers are in the air for a minimum of 131.2 ft (40 m) aft of the stern and within 6.6 ft (2 m) horizontally of the point where the main groundline enters the water. A minimum of 8 streamers must be out of the water aft of the stern.

      () Vessels greater than or equal to 55 feet (16.8 m) LOA must use paired streamer lines. At least one streamer line must be deployed before the first hook is set in such a way that streamers are in the air for a minimum of 131._2_ ft (40 m) aft of the stern and within 6.6 ft (2 m) horizontally of the point where the main groundline enters the water. A minimum of 8 streamers must be out of the water aft of the stern. The second streamer line must be deployed within 90 seconds thereafter.

      () For vessels deploy_i_ng gear from the stern, the streamer lines must be deployed from the stern, one on each side of the main groundline.

      () For vessels deploying gear from the side, the streamer lines must be deployed from the stern, one over the main groundline and the other on one side of the main groundline.

      (iii) Vessels without masts, poles, or rigging. A minimum of 1 buoy bag line must be used by vessels without superstructure, including masts, poles, or rigging. The buoy bag line must hang over the area where baited hooks may be accessible to seabirds, which is generally within 6.5 feet (2 m) of the sea surface.

      (iv) The following weather safety exemptions apply, based on vessel length:

      (A) Vessels greater than or equal to 26 feet (7.9 m) and less than 55 feet (16.8 m) LOA are exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section when a National Weather Service Small Craft Advisory for Winds is in effect, or other National Weather Service Advisory for wind speeds exceeding those that trigger a Small Craft Advisory for Winds. This exemption applies only during the time and within the area indicated in the National Weather Service Weather Advisory or in an area seaward of such an area.

      (B) Vessels 55 feet and longer (16.8 m) LOA are exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section when a National Weather Service Gale Warning is in effect. This exemption applies only during the time and within the area indicated in the National Weather Service Gale Warning.

      (3)  The operator of a vessel described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that begins and completes deployment of gear between one hour after local sunset and one hour before local sunrise is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

      § 660.24   Limited entry and open access fisheries.

#### § § 660.24

      (a)  All commercial fishing for groundfish must be conducted in accordance with the regulations governing limited entry and open access fisheries, except such fishing by treaty Indian tribes as may be separately provided for.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 660.25   Permits.

#### § § 660.25

      (a)  Each of the permits or licenses in this section has different conditions or privileges as part of the permit or license. The permits or licenses in this section confer a conditional privilege of participating in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery, in accordance with Federal regulations in 50 CFR part 660, subparts C through G.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  In order for a vessel to be used to fish in the limited entry fishery, the vessel owner must hold a limited entry permit and, through SFD, must register that vessel for use with a limited entry permit. When participating in the limited entry fishery, a vessel is authorized to fish with the gear type endorsed on the limited entry permit registered for use with that vessel, except that the MS permit does not have a gear endorsement. There are three types of gear endorsements: Trawl, longline, and pot (or trap). All limited entry permits, except the MS permit, have size endorsements; a vessel registered for use with a limited entry permit must comply with the vessel size requirements of this subpart. A sablefish endorsement is also required for a vessel to be used to fish in the primary season for the limited entry fixed gear sablefish fishery, north of 36° N. lat. Certain limited entry permits will also have endorsements required for participation in a specific fishery, such as the MS/CV endorsement and the C/P endorsement.

      (ii)  Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12113 (a) may be issued or may hold a limited entry permit.

      (iii)  Limited entry permits will normally be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the permit is issued, renewed, or replaced. If the permit will be used with a vessel other than the one registered on the permit, the permit owner must register that permit for use with the new vessel through the SFD. The reissued permit must be placed on board the new vessel in order for the vessel to be used to fish in the limited entry fishery.

      (A) For all limited entry permits, including MS permits, MS/CV-endorsed permits, and C/P-endorsed permits when they are not fishing in the at-sea whiting fisheries, registration of a limited entry permit to be used with a new vessel will take effect no earlier than the first day of the next major limited entry cumulative limit period following the date SFD receives the change in vessel registration form and the original permit.

      (B) For MS permits, MS/CV-endorsed permits, and C/P-endorsed permits when they are fishing in the at-sea whiting fisheries, registration of a limited entry permit to be used with a new vessel will take effect on the date NMFS approves and issues the permit.

      (iv)  Limited entry permits may not be divided for use by more than one vessel.

      (v)  SFD will make a determination regarding permit endorsements, renewal, replacement, change in permit ownership and change in vessel registration. SFD will notify the permit owner in writing with an explanation of any determination to deny a permit endorsement, renewal, replacement, change in permit ownership or change in vessel registration. The SFD will decline to act on an application for permit endorsement, renewal, replacement, or change in registration of a limited entry permit if the permit is subject to sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.

      (2)  The MS permit conveys a conditional privilege for the vessel registered to it, to participate in the MS fishery by receiving and processing deliveries of groundfish in the Pacific whiting mothership sector. An MS permit is a type of limited entry permit. An MS permit does not have any endorsements affixed to the permit. The provisions for the MS permit, including eligibility, renewal, change of permit ownership, vessel registration, fees, and appeals are described at § 660.150 (f).

      (3) —(i)  A limited entry permit with an “A” endorsement entitles the vessel registered to the permit to fish in the limited entry fishery for all groundfish species with the type(s) of limited entry gear specified in the endorsement, except for sablefish harvested north of 36° N. lat. during times and with gears for which a sablefish endorsement is required. See paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section for provisions on sablefish endorsement requirements. An “A” endorsement is affixed to the limited entry permit. The limited entry permit with an “A” endorsement may be registered to another person (, change in permit ownership), or to a different vessel (, change in vessel registration) under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. An “A” endorsement expires on failure to renew the limited entry permit to which it is affixed. An MS permit is not considered a limited entry “A”-endorsed permit.

      (ii)  There are three types of gear endorsements: Trawl, longline, and pot (trap). When limited entry “A”-endorsed permits were first issued, some vessel owners qualified for more than one type of gear endorsement based on the landings history of their vessels. Each limited entry “A”-endorsed permit has one or more gear endorsement(s). Gear endorsement(s) assigned to the permit at the time of issuance will be permanent and shall not be modified. While participating in the limited entry fishery, the vessel registered to the limited entry “A”-endorsed permit is authorized to fish the gear(s) endorsed on the permit. While participating in the limited entry, fixed gear primary fishery for sablefish described at § 660.231, a vessel registered to more than one limited entry permit is authorized to fish with any gear, except trawl gear, endorsed on at least one of the permits registered for use with that vessel. Vessels registered to limited entry permits may be used to fish with open access gear, subject to the crossover provisions at § 660.60(h)(7)(ii), except that vessels registered to sablefish-endorsed permits fishing in the sablefish primary season described at § 660.231, may not fish with open access gear against those limits. An MS permit does not have a gear endorsement.

      (iii) —(A)  Each limited entry “A”-endorsed permit will be endorsed with the LOA for the size of the vessel that initially qualified for the permit, except when permits are combined into one permit to be registered for use with a vessel requiring a larger size endorsement, the new permit will be endorsed for the size that results from the combination of the permits.

      (B)  () A limited entry permit may be registered for use with a vessel up to 5 ft (_1_.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or any length shorter than, the size endorsed on the existing permit without requiring a combination of permits or a change in the size endorsement.

      () The vessel harvest capacity rating for each of the permits being combined is that indicated in Table 3 of subpart C for the LOA (in feet) endorsed on the respective limited entry permit. Harvest capacity ratings for fractions of a foot in vessel length will be determined by multiplying the fraction of a foot in vessel length by the difference in the two ratings assigned to the nearest integers of vessel length. The length rating for the combined permit is that indicated for the sum of the vessel harvest capacity ratings for each permit being combined. If that sum falls between the sums for two adjacent lengths on Table 3 of subpart C, the length rating shall be the higher length.

      (C)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section, when multiple permits are “stacked” on a vessel, as described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii), at least one of the permits must meet the size requirements of those sections. The permit that meets the size requirements of those sections is considered the vessel's “base” permit, as defined in § 660.11, subpart C. If more than one permit registered for use with the vessel has an appropriate length endorsement for that vessel, NMFS SFD will designate a base permit by selecting the permit that has been registered to the vessel for the longest time. If the permit owner objects to NMFS' selection of the base permit, the permit owner may send a letter to NMFS SFD requesting the change and the reasons for the request. If the permit requested to be changed to the base permit is appropriate for the length of the vessel, NMFS SFD will reissue the permit with the new base permit. Any additional permits that are stacked for use with a vessel participating in the limited entry fixed gear primary sablefish fishery may be registered for use with a vessel even if the vessel is more than 5 ft (1.5 m) longer or shorter than the size endorsed on the permit.

      (iv) —(A)  Participation in the limited entry fixed gear sablefish fishery during the primary season north of 36° N. lat., described in § 660.231, Subpart E, requires that an owner of a vessel hold (by ownership or lease) a limited entry permit, registered for use with that vessel, with a longline or trap (or pot) endorsement and a sablefish endorsement. Up to three permits with sablefish endorsements may be registered for use with a single vessel. Limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements are assigned to one of three different cumulative trip limit tiers, based on the qualifying catch history of the permit.

      () A sablefish endorsement with a tier assignment will be affixed to the permit and will remain valid when the permit is registered to another permit owner (, change in permit ownership) or to another vessel (, change in vessel registration).

      () A sablefish endorsement and its associated tier assignment are not separable from the limited entry permit, and therefore, may not be registered to another permit owner (, change in permit ownership) or to another vessel (, change in vessel registration) separately from the limited entry permit.

      (B)  () No partnership or corporation may own a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement unless that partnership or corporation owned a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement on November _1_, 2000. Otherwise, only individual human persons may own limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements.

      () No individual person, partnership, or corporation in combination may have ownership interest in or hold more than 3 permits with sablefish endorsements either simultaneously or cumulatively over the primary season, except for an individual person, or partnerships or corporations that had ownership interest in more than 3 permits with sablefish endorsements as of November 1, _2_000. The exemption from the maximum ownership level of 3 permits only applies to ownership of the particular permits that were owned on November 1, 2000. An individual person, or partnerships or corporations that had ownership interest in 3 or more permits with sablefish endorsements as of November 1, 2000, may not acquire additional permits beyond those particular permits owned on November 1, 2000. If, at some future time, an individual person, partnership, or corporation that owned more than 3 permits as of November 1, 2000, sells or otherwise permanently transfers (not holding through a lease arrangement) some of its originally owned permits, such that they then own fewer than 3 permits, they may then acquire additional permits, but may not have ownership interest in or hold more than 3 permits.

      () A partnership or corporation will lose the exemptions provided in paragraphs (b)(_3_)(iv)(B)() and () of this section on the effective date of any change in the corporation or partnership from that which existed on November _1_, _2_000. A “change” in the partnership or corporation is defined at § 660.11. A change in the partnership or corporation must be reported to SFD within 15 calendar days of the addition of a new shareholder or partner.

      () Any partnership or corporation with any ownership interest in a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement or in the vessel registered to the permit shall document the extent of that ownership interest with NMFS via the Identification of Ownership Interest Form sent to the permit owner through the annual permit renewal process and whenever a change in permit owner, vessel owner, and/or vessel registration occurs as described at paragraph (b)(_4_)(v) and (vi) of this section. NMFS will not renew a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit through the annual renewal process described at paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, or approve a change in permit owner, vessel owner, and/or vessel registration unless the Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. Further, if NMFS discovers through review of the Identification of Ownership Interest Form that an individual person, partnership, or corporation owns or holds more than _3_ permits and is not authorized to do so under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section, the individual person, partnership or corporation will be notified and the permits owned or held by that individual person, partnership, or corporation will be void and reissued with the vessel status as “unidentified” until the permit owner owns and/or holds a quantity of permits appropriate to the restrictions and requirements described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section. If NMFS discovers through review of the Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a partnership or corporation has had a change in membership since November 1, __2__000, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section, the partnership or corporation will be notified, NMFS will void any existing permits, and reissue any permits owned and/or held by that partnership or corporation in “unidentified” status with respect to vessel registration until the partnership or corporation is able to register ownership of those permits to persons authorized under this section to own sablefish-endorsed limited entry permits.

      () A person, partnership, or corporation that is exempt from the owner-on-board requirement may sell all of their permits, buy another sablefish-endorsed permit within one year of the date of approval of the last change in permit ownership, and retain their exemption from the owner-on-board requirements. An individual person, partnership or corporation could only obtain a permit if it has not added or changed individuals since November 1, 2000, excluding individuals that have left the partnership or corporation or that have died.

      (C)  As described in (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, no individual person, partnership, or corporation in combination may own and/or hold more than three sablefish-endorsed permits. A vessel owner that meets the qualifying criteria described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)() of this section may request an exemption from the ownership limitation.

      ()  The three qualifying criteria for an ownership limitation exemption are: The vessel owner currently has no more than 20 percent ownership interest in a vessel registered to the sablefish endorsed permit, the vessel owner currently has ownership interest in Alaska sablefish individual fishing quota, and the vessel has fished in the past _1_2-month period in both the West Coast groundfish limited entry fixed gear fishery and the Sablefish IFQ Program in Alaska. The best evidence of a vessel owner having met these qualifying criteria will be state fish tickets or landing receipts from the West Coast states and Alaska. The qualifying vessel owner may seek an ownership limitation exemption for sablefish endorsed permits registered to no more than two vessels.

      ()  The SFD will make the qualifying criteria and application instructions available online at  A vessel owner who believes that they may qualify for the ownership limitation exemption must submit evidence with their application showing how their vessel has met the qualifying criteria described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)() of this section. The vessel owner must also submit a Sablefish Permit Ownership Limitation Exemption Identification of Ownership Interest form that includes disclosure of percentage of ownership in the vessel and disclosure of individual shareholders in any entity. Paragraph (i) of this section sets out the relevant evidentiary standards and burden of proof. Applications may be submitted at any time to NMFS at: NMFS West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, ATTN: Fisheries Permit Office—Sablefish Ownership Limitation Exemption, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98_1_15. After receipt of a complete application, the SFD will issue an IAD in writing to the applicant determining whether the applicant qualifies for the exemption. If an applicant chooses to file an appeal of the IAD, the applicant must follow the appeals process outlined at paragraph (g) of this section and, for the timing of the appeals, at paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.

      ()  If at any time a change occurs relative to the qualifying criteria described at paragraph (b)(_3_)(iv)(C)(), the vessel owner to whom the ownership limitation exemption applies must notify NMFS within 30 calendar days. If such changes mean the vessel owner no longer meets the qualifying criteria, the ownership limitation exemption becomes automatically null and void 30 calendar days after the date the vessel owner no longer meets the qualifying criteria. At any time, NMFS may request that the vessel owner submit a new exemption application. If NMFS at any time finds the vessel owner no longer meets the qualifying criteria described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)() of this section NMFS will issue an IAD, which may be appealed, as described at paragraph (g) of this section.

      (v)  An MS/CV endorsement on a trawl limited entry permit conveys a conditional privilege that allows a vessel registered to it to fish in either the co-op or non-cooperative fishery in the MS Co-op Program described at § 660.150, subpart D. The provisions for the MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit, including eligibility, renewal, change of permit ownership, vessel registration, combinations, accumulation limits, fees, and appeals are described at § 660.150. Each MS/CV endorsement has an associated catch history assignment (CHA) that is permanently linked as originally issued by NMFS and which cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. Regulations detailing this process and MS/CV-endorsed permit combinations are outlined in § 660.150(g)(2), subpart D.

      (vi)  A C/P endorsement on a trawl limited entry permit conveys a conditional privilege that allows a vessel registered to it to fish in the C/P Co-op Program described at § 660.160. The provisions for the C/P-endorsed limited entry permit, including eligibility, renewal, change of permit ownership, vessel registration, combinations, fees, and appeals are described at § 660.160(e).

      (vii)  “A” endorsements, gear endorsements, sablefish endorsements and sablefish tier assignments, and C/P endorsements may not be registered to another permit owner (, change in permit ownership or ownership interest) or to another vessel (, change in vessel registration) separately from the limited entry permit. At-sea processing exemptions, specified at paragraph (b)(6) of this section, are associated with the vessel and not with the limited entry permit and may not be registered to another permit owner or to another vessel without losing the exemption.

      (4) —renewal, combination, stacking, joint registration, change of permit owner or vessel owner, and change in vessel registration—

      (i)  (A) Limited entry permits expire at the end of each calendar year, and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in order to remain in force the following year.

      (B) Notification to renew limited entry permits will be issued by SFD prior to September 15 each year to the permit owner's most recent address in the SFD record. The permit owner shall provide SFD with notice of any address change within 15 days of the change.

      (C) Limited entry permit renewal requests received in SFD between November 30 and December 31 will be effective on the date that the renewal is approved. A limited entry permit that is allowed to expire will not be renewed unless the permit owner requests reissuance by March 31 of the following year and the SFD determines that failure to renew was proximately caused by illness, injury, or death of the permit owner.

      (D) Limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements, as described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, will not be renewed until SFD has received complete documentation of permit ownership as required under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section.

      (E) Limited entry permits with an MS/catcher vessel (CV) endorsement will not be renewed until SFD has received complete documentation of permit ownership as required under § 660.150(g).

      (F) A limited entry permit will not be renewed until a complete economic data collection form is submitted as required under § 660.113(b), (c) and (d), subpart D. The permit renewal will be marked incomplete until the required information is submitted.

      (G) An MS permit or a limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement will not be renewed, if it was the permit owner that failed to pay, until payment of all cost recovery program fees required pursuant to § 660.115 has been made. The IAD, appeals, and final decision process for the cost recovery program is specified at § 660.115(d)(3)(ii).

      (ii)  Two or more limited entry permits with “A” gear endorsements for the same type of limited entry gear may be combined and reissued as a single permit with a larger size endorsement as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

      (A)  With respect to limited entry permits endorsed for longline and pot (trap) gear, a sablefish endorsement will be issued for the new permit only if all of the permits being combined have sablefish endorsements. If two or more permits with sablefish endorsements are combined, the new permit will receive the same tier assignment as the tier with the largest cumulative landings limit of the permits being combined.

      (B)  When an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another MS/CV-endorsed permit or with another limited entry trawl permit with no MS/CV or C/P endorsement, the resulting permit will be MS/CV-endorsed with the associated CHA as specified at § 660.150(g)(2)(iv) and (v). If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with a C/P-endorsed permit, the MS/CV endorsement and CHA will not be reissued on the combined permit.

      (C)  A C/P-endorsed permit that is combined with a limited entry trawl permit that is not C/P-endorsed will result in a single C/P-endorsed permit with a larger size endorsement. An MS/CV endorsement on one of the permits being combined will not be reissued on the resulting permit.

      (iii)  “Stacking” limited entry permits, as defined at § 660.11, refers to the practice of registering more than one sablefish-endorsed permit for use with a single vessel. Only limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements may be stacked. Up to 3 limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements may be registered for use with a single vessel during the sablefish primary season described at § 660.231, subpart E. Privileges, responsibilities, and restrictions associated with stacking permits to fish in the sablefish primary fishery are described at § 660.231, subpart E and at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (iv) —(A)  “Joint registration” of limited entry permits, as defined at § 660.11, is the practice of simultaneously registering both trawl-endorsed and longline or trap/pot-endorsed limited entry permits for use with a single vessel.

      (B)  Subject to vessel size endorsements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii), any limited entry permit with a trawl endorsement and any limited entry permit with a longline or trap/pot endorsement may be jointly registered for use with a single vessel but only in one of the following configurations:

      () a single trawl-endorsed limited entry permit and one, two or three sablefish-endorsed fixed gear (longline and/or fishpot endorsed) limited entry permits; or

      () a single trawl-endorsed limited entry permit and one longline-endorsed limited entry permit for use with a single vessel.

      (v) —(A)  Change in permit owner and/or vessel owner applications must be submitted to NMFS with the appropriate documentation described at paragraphs (b)(4)(viii) and (ix) of this section. The permit owner may convey the limited entry permit to a different person. The new permit owner will not be authorized to use the permit until the change in permit owner has been registered with and approved by NMFS. NMFS will not approve a change in permit owner for a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement that does not meet the ownership requirements for such permit described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section. NMFS will not approve a change in permit owner for a limited entry permit with an MS/CV endorsement that does not meet the ownership requirements for such permit described at § 660.150(g)(3). NMFS considers the following as a change in permit owner that would require registering with and approval by NMFS, including but not limited to: Selling the permit to another individual or entity; adding an individual or entity to the legal name on the permit; or removing an individual or entity from the legal name on the permit. A change in vessel owner includes any changes to the name(s) of any or all vessel owners, as registered with U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or a state. The new owner(s) of a vessel registered to a limited entry permit must report any change in vessel ownership to NMFS within 30 calendar days after such change has been registered with the USCG or a state licensing agency.

      (B)  The change in permit ownership or change in the vessel holding the permit will be effective on the day the change is approved by NMFS, unless there is a concurrent change in the vessel registered to the permit. Requirements for changing the vessel registered to the permit are described at paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section.

      (C)  If a permit owner submits an application to register a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit to a new permit owner or vessel owner during the primary sablefish season described at § 660.231 (generally April 1 through December 31), the initial permit owner must certify on the application form the cumulative quantity, in round weight, of primary season sablefish landed against that permit as of the application signature date for the then current primary season. The new permit owner or vessel owner must sign the application form acknowledging the amount of landings to date given by the initial permit owner. This certified amount should match the total amount of primary season sablefish landings reported on state landing receipts. As required at § 660.12(b), any person landing sablefish must retain on board the vessel from which sablefish is landed, and provide to an authorized officer upon request, copies of any and all reports of sablefish landings from the primary season containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable state law throughout the primary sablefish season during which a landing occurred and for 15 days thereafter.

      (D)  The requirements for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration between limited entry trawl permits are specified at § 660.150(g)(2)(iv).

      (vi) —(A)  A permit may not be used with any vessel other than the vessel registered to that permit. For purposes of this section, a permit change in vessel registration occurs when, through SFD, a permit owner registers a limited entry permit for use with a new vessel. Permit change in vessel registration applications must be submitted to SFD with the appropriate documentation described at paragraph (b)(_4_)(viii) of this section. Upon receipt of a complete application, and following review and approval of the application, the SFD will reissue the permit registered to the new vessel. Applications to change vessel registration on limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements will not be approved until SFD has received complete documentation of permit ownership as described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)() and as required under paragraph (b)(4)(viii) of this section. Applications to change vessel registration on limited entry permits with trawl endorsements or MS permits will not be approved until SFD has received complete EDC forms as required under § 660.114, subpart D.

      (B)  Change in vessel registration applications must be submitted to NMFS with the appropriate documentation described at paragraphs (b)(4)(viii) and (ix) of this section. At a minimum, a permit owner seeking to change vessel registration of a limited entry permit shall submit to NMFS a signed application form and his/her current limited entry permit before the first day of the cumulative limit period in which they wish to fish. If a permit owner provides a signed application and current limited entry permit after the first day of a cumulative limit period, the permit will not be effective until the succeeding cumulative limit period. NMFS will not approve a change in vessel registration until it receives a complete application, the existing permit, a current copy of the USCG 1270, and other required documentation.

      (C)  Changes in vessel registration on permits will take effect no sooner than the first day of the next major limited entry cumulative limit period following the date that SFD receives the signed permit change in vessel registration form and the original limited entry permit, except that changes in vessel registration on MS permits and C/P-endorsed permits will take effect immediately upon reissuance to the new vessel, and a change in vessel registration on MS/CV-endorsed permits will take effect immediately upon reissuance to the new vessel only on the second change in vessel registration for the year. No change in vessel registration is effective until the limited entry permit has been reissued as registered with the new vessel.

      (D)  If a permit owner submits an application to register a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit to a new vessel during the primary sablefish season described at § 660.231 (generally April 1 through December 31), the initial permit owner must certify on the application form the cumulative quantity, in round weight, of primary season sablefish landed against that permit as of the application signature date for the then current primary season. The new permit owner or vessel owner associated with the new vessel must sign the application form acknowledging the amount of landings to date given by the initial permit owner. This certified amount should match the total amount of primary season sablefish landings reported on state landing receipts. As required at § 660.12(b), any person landing sablefish must retain on board the vessel from which sablefish is landed, and provide to an authorized officer upon request, copies of any and all reports of sablefish landings from the primary season containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable state law throughout the primary sablefish season during which a landing occurred and for 15 days thereafter.

      (vii) —(A)  A permit owner may designate the vessel registration for a permit as “unidentified,” meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. No vessel is authorized to use a permit with the vessel registration designated as “unidentified.” A vessel owner who removes a permit from his vessel and registers that permit as “unidentified” is not exempt from VMS requirements at § 660.14, unless specifically authorized by that section. When a permit owner requests that the permit's vessel registration be designated as “unidentified,” the transaction is not considered a change in vessel registration for purposes of this section. Any subsequent request by a permit owner to change from the “unidentified” status of the permit in order to register the permit with a specific vessel will be considered a change in vessel registration and subject to the restriction on frequency and timing of changes in vessel registration.

      (B)  Limited entry fixed gear and trawl-endorsed permits (without MS/CV or C/P endorsements) may not be registered for use with a different vessel more than once per calendar year, except in cases of death of a vessel owner or if the vessel registered to the permit is totally lost as defined in § 660.11. The exception for death of a vessel owner applies for a vessel owned by a partnership or a corporation if the person or persons with at least 50 percent of the ownership interest in the entity dies.

      (C)  Limited entry permits with an MS/CV endorsement may be registered to another vessel up to two times during the calendar year as long as the second change in vessel registration is back to the original vessel. The original vessel is either the vessel registered to the permit as of January 1, or if no vessel is registered to the permit as of January 1, the original vessel is the first vessel to which the permit is registered after January 1. After the original vessel has been established, the first change in vessel registration would be to another vessel, but any second change in vessel registration must be back to the original vessel. On the second change in vessel registration back to the original vessel, that vessel must be used to fish exclusively in the MS Co-op Program described at § 660.150 for the remainder of the calendar year, and declare into the limited entry mid water trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector as specified at § 660.13(d)(4)(iv).

      (D)  Vessels registered to both a MS permit and a C/P endorsed permit may operate in both the at-sea MS sector and C/P sector during the same calendar year, but not on the same trip. Prior to leaving port, a vessel registered under both a MS permit and a C/P endorsed permit must declare through VMS the sector in which it will participate for the duration of the trip, as specified at § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A).

      (viii)  Permit owners may request a change in vessel registration and/or change in permit owner or vessel owner by submitting a complete application form. In addition, a permit owner applying for a change in vessel registration and/or change in permit owner of a limited entry permit has the burden to submit evidence to prove that qualification requirements are met. If a change in vessel owner occurs, the new vessel owner has the burden to submit evidence to prove that qualification requirements are met. The following evidentiary standards apply:

      (A) For a request to change a vessel registration and/or change a permit owner or vessel owner, the permit owner must provide NMFS with a current copy of the USCG Form 1270 for vessels of 5 net tons or greater, or a current copy of a state registration form for vessels under 5 net tons.

      (B) For a request to change a vessel registration and/or change a permit owner or vessel owner for sablefish-endorsed permits with a tier assignment for which a corporation or partnership is listed as permit owner and/or vessel owner, an Identification of Ownership Interest Form must be completed and included with the application form.

      (C) For a request to change a vessel registration and/or change a permit owner or vessel owner for a MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit, an Identification of Ownership Interest Form must be completed and included with the application form.

      (D) For a request to change the vessel registration to a permit, the permit owner must submit to SFD a current marine survey conducted by a certified marine surveyor in accordance with USCG regulations to authenticate the length overall of the vessel being newly registered with the permit. Marine surveys older than 3 years at the time of the request for change in vessel registration will not be considered “current” marine surveys for purposes of this requirement.

      (E) For a request to change a permit's ownership where the current permit owner is a corporation, partnership or other business entity, the applicant must provide to SFD a corporate resolution that authorizes the conveyance of the permit to a new owner and which authorizes the individual applicant to request the conveyance on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or other business entity.

      (F) For a request to change a permit's ownership that is necessitated by the death of the permit owner(s), the individual(s) requesting conveyance of the permit to a new owner must provide SFD with a death certificate of the permit owner(s) and appropriate legal documentation that either: Specifically registers the permit to a designated individual(s); or, provides legal authority to the transferor to convey the permit ownership or to request a change in vessel registration.

      (G) For a request to change a permit's ownership that is necessitated by divorce, the individual requesting the change in permit ownership must submit an executed divorce decree that awards the permit to a designated individual(s).

      (H) Such other relevant, credible documentation as the applicant may submit, or the SFD or Regional Administrator may request or acquire, may also be considered.

      (ix)  Application forms for a change in vessel registration, permit owner, or vessel owner are available at: NMFS West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, ATTN: Fisheries Permit Office, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115; or  Contents of the application, and required supporting documentation, are also specified in the application form. Only complete applications will be processed.

      (x)  The SFD will maintain records of all limited entry permits that have been issued, renewed, registered, or replaced.

      (5)  (i) Small limited entry fisheries fleets that are controlled by a local government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible impacts on the groundfish resource, may be certified as consistent with the goals and objectives of the limited entry program and incorporated into the limited entry fishery. Permits issued under this subsection will be issued in accordance with the standards and procedures set out in the PCGFMP and will carry the rights explained therein.

      (ii) A permit issued under this section may be registered only to another vessel that will continue to operate in the same certified small fleet, provided that the total number of vessels in the fleet does not increase. A vessel may not use a small fleet limited entry permit for participation in the limited entry fishery outside of authorized activities of the small fleet for which that permit and vessel have been designated.

      (6) —(i)  No new applications for sablefish at-sea processing exemptions will be accepted. As specified at § 660.212(d)(3), subpart E, vessels are prohibited from processing sablefish at sea that were caught in the sablefish primary fishery without a sablefish at-sea processing exemption. Any sablefish at-sea processing exemptions were issued to a particular vessel and that permit and vessel owner who requested the exemption. The exemption is not part of the limited entry permit. The exemption cannot be registered with any other vessel, vessel owner, or permit owner for any reason. The exemption only applies to at-sea processing of sablefish caught in the sablefish primary fishery. The sablefish at-sea processing exemption will expire upon registration of the vessel to a new owner or if the vessel is totally lost, as defined at § 660.11.

      (ii)  No new applications for non-whiting at-sea processing exemptions will be accepted. As specified at § 660.112(b)(1)(xii), subpart D, vessels are prohibited from processing non-whiting groundfish at sea that were caught in the Shorebased IFQ Program without a non-whiting at-sea processing exemption. Any non-whiting at-sea processing exemptions were issued to a particular vessel and that permit and/or vessel owner who requested the exemption. The exemption is not part of the limited entry permit. The exemption is not transferable to any other vessel, vessel owner, or permit owner for any reason. The exemption only applies to at-sea processing of non-whiting groundfish caught in the Shorebased IFQ Program. The non-whiting at-sea processing exemption will expire upon registration of the vessel to a new owner or if the vessel is totally lost, as defined at § 660.11.

      (c)  A QS permit conveys a conditional privilege to a person to own QS or IBQ for designated species and species groups and to fish in the Shorebased IFQ Program described § 660.140, subpart D. A QS permit is not a limited entry permit. The provisions for the QS permit, including eligibility, renewal, change of permit ownership, accumulation limits, fees, and appeals are described at § 660.140, subpart D.

      (d)  The first receiver site license conveys a conditional privilege to a first receiver to receive, purchase, or take custody, control or possession of landings from the Shorebased IFQ Program. The first receiver site license is issued for a person and a unique physical site consistent with the terms and conditions required to account for and weigh the landed species. A first receiver site license is not a limited entry permit. The provisions for the First Receiver Site License, including eligibility, registration, change of ownership, fees, and appeals are described at § 660.140(f), subpart D.

      (e) —(1)  An MS co-op permit conveys a conditional privilege to an eligible co-op entity to receive and manage a cooperative's allocation of designated species and species groups. An MS co-op permit is not a limited entry permit. The provisions for the MS co-op permit, including eligibility, annual registration, fees, and appeals are described in the MS Co-op Program at § 660.150, subpart D.

      (2)  A C/P co-op permit conveys a conditional privilege to an eligible co-op entity to receive and manage a cooperative's allocation of designated species and species groups. A C/P co-op permit is not a limited entry permit. The provisions for the C/P co-op permit, including eligibility, annual registration, fees, and appeals are described in the C/P Co-op Program at § 660.160, subpart D.

      (f)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to issuance of permits including initial issuance, renewal, permit registration, vessel registration, replacement, and appeals. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.

      (g) —(1)  For permit actions, including issuance, renewal, change in vessel registration and/or change in permit owner or vessel owner, and endorsement upgrade, the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries will make an IAD on the action. In cases where the applicant disagrees with the IAD, the applicant may appeal that decision. Final decisions on appeals of IADs regarding issuance, renewal, change in vessel registration and/or change in permit owner or vessel owner, and endorsement upgrade, will be made in writing by the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce and will state the reasons therefore. This section describes the procedures for appealing the IAD on permit actions made in this title under subparts C through G of part 660. Additional information regarding appeals of an IAD related to the trawl rationalization program is contained in the specific program sections under subpart D of part 660.

      (2)  Only a person who received an IAD that disapproved any part of their application may file a written appeal. For purposes of this section, such person will be referred to as the “applicant.”

      (3)  (i) The appeal must be in writing, must allege credible facts or circumstances to show why the criteria in this subpart have been met, and must include any relevant information or documentation to support the appeal.

      (ii) Appeals must be mailed or faxed to: NMFS West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, ATTN: Appeals, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA, 98115; Fax: 206-526-6426; or delivered to National Marine Fisheries Service at the same address.

      (4)  (i) For permit actions related to the application and initial issuance process for QS permits, MS permits, MS/CV endorsements, and C/P endorsements for the trawl rationalization program listed in subpart D of part 660, if an applicant appeals an IAD, the appeal must be postmarked, faxed, or hand delivered to NMFS no later than 60 calendar days after the date on the IAD. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (ii) For all other permit actions, if an applicant appeals an IAD, the appeal must be postmarked, faxed, or hand delivered to NMFS no later than 30 calendar days after the date on the IAD. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (iii) The time period to submit an appeal begins with the date on the IAD. If the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the next business day.

      (5)  For purposes of the appeals process, NMFS will establish as the address of record, the address used by the applicant in initial correspondence to NMFS. Notifications of all actions affecting the applicant after establishing an address of record will be mailed to that address, unless the applicant provides NMFS, in writing, with any changes to that address. NMFS bears no responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS.

      (6)  (i) For the appeal of an IAD related to the application and initial issuance process for the trawl rationalization program listed in subpart D of part 660, the Regional Administrator shall appoint an appeals officer. After determining there is sufficient information and that all procedural requirements have been met, the appeals officer will review the record and issue a recommendation on the appeal to the Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory only. The recommendation must be based solely on the record. Upon receiving the findings and recommendation, the Regional Administrator shall issue a final decision on the appeal acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce in accordance with paragraph (g)(6)(ii) of this section.

      (ii)  The Regional Administrator will issue a written decision on the appeal which is the final decision of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (7)  (i) For all permit actions, except those actions related to the application and initial issuance process for the trawl rationalization program listed in subpart D of part 660, the permit registration remains as it was prior to the request until the final decision has been made.

      (ii) For permit actions related to the application and initial issuance process for the trawl rationalization program listed in subpart D of part 660, the status of permits pending appeal is as follows:

      (A) For permit and endorsement qualifications and eligibility appeals (, QS permit, MS permit, MS/CV endorsement, C/P endorsement), any permit or endorsement under appeal after December 31, 2010 may not be used to fish in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery until a final decision on the appeal has been made. If the permit or endorsement will be issued, the permit or endorsement will be effective upon approval, except for QS permits, which will be effective at the start of the next fishing year.

      (B) For a QS or IBQ amount for specific IFQ management unit species under appeal, the QS or IBQ amount for the IFQ species under appeal will remain as the amount assigned to the associated QS permit in the IAD). The QS permit may be used to fish in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery with the QS or IBQ amounts assigned to the QS permit in the IAD. Once a final decision on the appeal has been made and if a revised QS or IBQ amount for a specific IFQ species will be assigned to the QS permit, the additional QS or IBQ amount associated with the QS permit will be effective at the start of the next calendar year following the final decision.

      (C) For a Pacific whiting catch history assignment associated with an MS/CV endorsement under appeal, the catch history assignment will remain as that previously assigned to the associated MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit in the IAD). The MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit may be used to fish in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery with the catch history assigned to the MS/CV-endorsed permit in the IAD. Once a final decision on the appeal has been made, and if a revised catch history assignment will be issued, the additional Pacific whiting catch history assignment associated with the MS/CV endorsement will be effective at the start of the next calendar year following the final decision.

      (h)  (1) All permits and licenses issued or applied for under Subparts C through G are subject to sanctions pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(g) and 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.

      (2) All Shorebased IFQ Program permits (QS permit, first receiver site license), QS accounts, vessel accounts, and MS Co-op Program permits (MS permit, MS/CV-endorsed permit, and MS co-op permit), and C/P Co-op Program permits (C/P-endorsed permit, C/P co-op permit) issued under subpart D:

      § 660.30   Compensation with fish for collecting resource information—EFPs.

#### § § 660.30

      In addition to the reasons stated in § 600.745(b)(1) of this chapter, an EFP may be issued under this subpart C for the purpose of compensating the owner or operator of a vessel for collecting resource information according to a protocol approved by NMFS. NMFS may issue an EFP allowing a vessel to retain fish as compensation in excess of trip limits or to be exempt from other specified management measures for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.

      (a)  NMFS may issue an EFP to the owner or operator of a vessel that conducted a resource survey according to a contract with NMFS. A vessel's total compensation from all sources (in terms of dollars or amount of fish, including fish from survey samples or compensation fish) will be determined through normal Federal procurement procedures. The compensation EFP will specify the maximum amount or value of fish the vessel may take and retain after the resource survey is completed.

      (1)  NMFS may initiate a competitive solicitation (request for proposals or RFP) to select vessels to conduct resource surveys that use fish as full or partial compensation, following normal Federal procurement procedures.

      (2)  At a Council meeting, NMFS will consult with the Council and receive public comment on upcoming resource surveys to be conducted if groundfish could be used as whole or partial compensation. Generally, compensation fish would be similar to surveyed species, but there may be reasons to provide payment with healthier, more abundant, less restricted stocks, or more easily targeted species. For example, NMFS may decline to pay a vessel with species that are, or are expected to be, overfished, or that are subject to overfishing, or that are unavoidably caught with species that are overfished or subject to overfishing. NMFS may also consider levels of discards, bycatch, and other factors. If the Council does not approve providing whole or partial compensation for the conduct of a survey, NMFS will not use fish, other than fish taken during the scientific research, as compensation for that survey. For each proposal, NMFS will present:

      (i) The maximum number of vessels expected or needed to conduct the survey,

      (ii) An estimate of the species and amount of fish likely to be needed as compensation,

      (iii) When the survey and compensation fish would be taken, and

      (iv) The year in which the compensation fish would be deducted from the ACL or ACT before determining the fishery harvest guideline or commercial harvest guideline.

      (3)  Upon successful completion of the survey, NMFS will issue a “compensation EFP” to the vessel if it has not been fully compensated. The procedures in § 600.745(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this chapter do not apply to a compensation EFP issued under this subpart for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery (50 CFR part 660, subparts C through G).

      (4)  Conditions for disposition of bycatch or any excess catch, for reporting the value of the amount landed, and other appropriate terms and conditions may be specified in the EFP. Compensation fishing must occur during the period specified in the EFP, but no later than the end of September of the fishing year following the survey, and must be conducted according to the terms and conditions of the EFP.

      (5)  The compensation EFP may require the vessel owner or operator to keep separate records of compensation fishing and to submit them to NMFS within a specified period of time after the compensation fishing is completed.

      (6)  As part of the harvest specifications process, as described at § 660.60, subpart C, NMFS will advise the Council of the amount of fish authorized to be retained under a compensation EFP, which then will be deducted from the next harvest specifications (ACLs or ACTs) set by the Council. Fish authorized in an EFP too late in the year to be deducted from the following year's ACLs or ACTs will be accounted for in the next management cycle where it is practicable to do so.

      (b) Compensation for commercial vessels collecting resource information under a standard EFP. NMFS may issue an EFP to allow a commercial fishing vessel to take and retain fish in excess of current management limits for the purpose of collecting resource information (§ 600.745(b) of this chapter). The EFP may include a compensation clause that allows the participating vessel to be compensated with fish for its efforts to collect resource information according to NMFS' approved protocol. If compensation with fish is requested in an EFP application, or proposed by NMFS, the following provisions apply in addition to those at § 600.745(b) of this chapter.

      (1)  In addition to the requirements in § 600.745(b) of this chapter, application for an EFP with a compensation clause must clearly state whether a vessel's participation is contingent upon compensation with groundfish and, if so, the minimum amount (in metric tons, round weight) and the species. As with other EFPs issued under § 600.745 of this chapter, the application may be submitted by any individual, including a state fishery management agency or other research institution.

      (2)  In addition to the reasons stated in § 600.745(b)(3)(iii) of this chapter, the application will be denied if the requested compensation fishery, species, or amount is unacceptable for reasons such as, but not limited to, the following: NMFS concludes the value of the resource information is not commensurate with the value of the compensation fish; the proposed compensation involves species that are (or are expected to be) overfished or subject to overfishing, fishing in times or areas where fishing is otherwise prohibited or severely restricted, or fishing for species that would involve unavoidable bycatch of species that are overfished or subject to overfishing; or NMFS concludes the information can reasonably be obtained at a less cost to the resource.

      (3)  If the Regional Administrator or designee agrees that compensation should be considered, and that more than a minor amount would be used as compensation, then a window period will be announced in the  during which additional participants will have an opportunity to apply. This notification would be made at the same time as announcement of receipt of the application and request for comments required under § 600.745(b). If there are more qualified applicants than needed for a particular time and area, NMFS will choose among the qualified vessels, either randomly, in order of receipt of the completed application, or by other impartial selection methods. If the permit applicant is a state, university, or Federal entity other than NMFS, and NMFS approves the selection method, the permit applicant may choose among the qualified vessels, either randomly, in order of receipt of the vessel application, or by other impartial selection methods.

      (4)  The EFP will specify the amounts that may be taken as scientific samples and as compensation, the time period during which the compensation fishing must occur, management measures that NMFS will waive for a vessel fishing under the EFP, and other terms and conditions appropriate to the fishery and the collection of resource information. NMFS may require compensation fishing to occur on the same trip that the resource information is collected.

      (5)  Samples taken under this EFP, as well as any compensation fish, count toward the current year's catch or landings.

      § 660.40   Rebuilding plans.

#### § § 660.40

      For each overfished groundfish stock with an approved rebuilding plan, this section contains the standards to be used to establish annual or biennial ACLs, specifically the target date for rebuilding the stock to its MSY level and the harvest control rule to be used to rebuild the stock. The harvest control rule may be expressed as a “Spawning Potential Ratio” or “SPR” harvest rate.

      (a)  Yelloweye rockfish was declared overfished in 2002. The target year for rebuilding the yelloweye rockfish stock to B is 2029. The harvest control rule to be used to rebuild the yelloweye rockfish stock is an annual SPR harvest rate of 65.0 percent.

      (b)  Quillback rockfish off California was declared overfished in 2023. The target year for rebuilding the California quillback rockfish stock to B is 2060. The harvest control rule to be used to rebuild the quillback rockfish stock off California is the ABC Rule (P* 0.45).

      § 660.50   Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries.

#### § § 660.50

      (a)  Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest groundfish in their usual and accustomed fishing areas in U.S. waters. In 1994, the United States formally recognized that the four Washington coastal treaty Indian tribes (Makah, Quileute, Hoh, and Quinault) have treaty rights to fish for groundfish in the Pacific Ocean, and concluded that, in general terms, the quantification of those rights is 50 percent of the harvestable surplus of groundfish that pass through the tribes U&A fishing areas.

      (b)  For the purposes of this part, Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes means the Hoh Indian Tribe, Makah Indian Tribe, Quileute Indian Tribe and the Quinault Indian Nation.

      (c)  The Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes' U&A fishing areas within the EEZ are set out in § 660.4.

      (d)  The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will be implemented by the Secretary, after consideration of the tribal request, the recommendation of the Council, and the comments of the public. The rights will be implemented either through an allocation or set-aside of fish that will be managed by the tribes, or through regulations in this section that will apply specifically to the tribal fisheries.

      (1)  An allocation, set-aside or a regulation specific to the tribes shall be initiated by a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to the Regional Administrator, prior to the first Council meeting in which biennial harvest specifications and management measures are discussed for an upcoming biennial management period. The Secretary generally will announce the annual tribal allocations at the same time as the announcement of the harvest specifications.

      (2)  The Secretary recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of Indian tribes over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. Accordingly, the Secretary will develop tribal allocations and regulations under this paragraph in consultation with the affected tribe(s) and, insofar as possible, with tribal consensus.

      (e)  A member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe fishing under this section and within their U&A fishing area is not subject to the provisions of other sections of subparts C through G of this part.

      (1)  A valid treaty Indian identification card issued pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the card.

      (2)  A limited entry permit described under § 660.25, subpart C is not required for a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to fish in a tribal fishery described in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (3)  Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply with this section, and with any applicable tribal law and regulation, when participating in a tribal groundfish fishery described in this section.

      (4)  Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe outside the applicable Indian tribe's U&A fishing area, or for a species of groundfish not covered by an allocation, set-aside, or regulation under this section, is subject to the regulations in the other sections of subpart C through subpart G of this part. Treaty fisheries operating within tribal allocations are prohibited from operating outside the U&A fishing areas described at § 660.4, subpart A.

      (f)  Trip limits for certain species were recommended by the Tribes and the Council and are specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (1)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 2,041 mt per year.

      (2)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 15 mt per year.

      (3)  (i) Harvest guidelines for commercial harvests of black rockfish by members of the Pacific Coast Indian Tribes using hook-and-line gear will be established biennially for two subsequent 1-year periods for the areas between the U.S.-Canadian border and Cape Alava (48°09.50′ N lat.) and between Destruction Island (47°40′ N lat.) and Leadbetter Point (46°38.17′ N lat.), in accordance with the procedures for implementing harvest specifications and management measures. Pacific Coast treaty Indians fishing for black rockfish in these areas under these harvest guidelines are subject to the provisions in this section, and not to the restrictions in subparts C through G of this part.

      (ii) For the commercial harvest of black rockfish off Washington State, a treaty Indian Tribes' harvest guideline is set at 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) for the area north of Cape Alava, WA (48°09.50′ N lat.) and 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) for the area between Destruction Island, WA (47°40′ N lat.) and Leadbetter Point, WA (46°38.17′ N lat.). This harvest guideline applies and is available to the Pacific Coast treaty Indian Tribes. There are no Tribal harvest restrictions for black rockfish in the area between Cape Alava and Destruction Island.

      (4)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 50 mt per year.

      (5)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 5 mt per year.

      (16)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 275 mt per year.

      (17)  The Tribal whiting allocation will be announced annually in conjunction with the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) setting process of the Whiting Act.

      (18)  The harvest guideline is 290 mt per year.

      (19)  (i) The sablefish allocation to Pacific coast treaty Indian Tribes is 10 percent of the sablefish ACL for the area north of 36° N lat. This allocation represents the total amount available to the treaty Indian fisheries before deductions for discard mortality.

      (ii) The Tribal allocation is 2,869 mt in 2025 and 2,724 mt in 2026. This allocation is, for each year, 10 percent of the Monterey through Vancouver area (North of 36° N lat.) ACL, including estimated discard mortality.

      (20)  The Tribal harvest guideline is 2 mt per year.

      (21)  The Tribal harvest guideline for shortspine thornyhead is 50 mt per year and the Tribal harvest guideline for longspine thornyhead is 30 mt per year.

      (2)  Subject to a 200-lb (90-kg) trip limit.

      (3)  Tribal whiting processed at-sea by non-Tribal vessels, must be transferred within the Tribal U&A from a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian Tribe fishing under this section.

      (4)  Makah Tribal members may use midwater trawl gear to take and retain groundfish for which there is no Tribal allocation and will be subject to the trip landing and frequency and size limits applicable to the limited entry fishery.

      (5)  Measures implemented to minimize adverse impacts to groundfish EFH, as described in § 660.12, do not apply to Tribal fisheries in their U&A fishing areas described at § 660.4, subpart A.

      (6)  Makah Tribal members fishing in the bottom trawl fishery may use only small footrope (less than or equal to 8 inches (20.3 cm)) bottom trawl gear.

      (h)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(v).

      § 660.55   Allocations.

#### § § 660.55

      (a)  The opportunity to harvest Pacific Coast groundfish is allocated among participants in the fishery when the ACLs for a given year are established in the biennial harvest specifications. For any stock that has been declared overfished, any formal allocation may be temporarily revised for the duration of the rebuilding period. For certain species, primarily trawl-dominant species, separate allocations for the trawl and non-trawl fishery (which for this purpose includes limited entry fixed gear, directed open access, and recreational fisheries) will be established biennially or annually using the standards and procedures described in Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP. Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP provides the allocation structure and percentages for species allocated between the trawl and non-trawl fisheries. Also, for those species not subject to the trawl and non-trawl allocations specified under Amendment 21 and in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, separate allocations for the limited entry and open access fisheries may be established using the procedures described in Chapters 6 and 11 of the PCGFMP and this subpart. Allocation of sablefish north of 36° N lat. is described in paragraph (h) of this section and in the PCGFMP. Allocation of Pacific whiting is described in paragraph (i) of this section and in the PCGFMP. Allocation of black rockfish is described in paragraph (l) of this section. Allocation of Pacific halibut bycatch is described in paragraph (m) of this section. Allocations not specified in the PCGFMP are established in regulation through the biennial harvest specifications and are listed in Tables 1 a through d and Tables 2 a through d of this subpart.

      (b)  Prior to the setting of fishery allocations, the TAC, ACL, or ACT when specified, is reduced by the Pacific Coast treaty Indian Tribal harvest (allocations, set-asides, and estimated harvest under regulations at § 660.50); projected scientific research catch of all groundfish species, estimates of fishing mortality in non-groundfish fisheries; and, as necessary, deductions to account for unforeseen catch events and deductions for EFPs. Deductions are listed in the footnotes of Tables 1a and 2a of subpart C of this part. The remaining amount after these deductions is the fishery harvest guideline or quota. (Note: recreational estimates are not deducted here.)

      (1) Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribal allocations, set-asides, and regulations are specified during the biennial harvest specifications process and are found at § 660.50 and in Tables 1a and 2a of this subpart.

      (2) Scientific research catch results from scientific research activity as defined in regulations at § 600.10.

      (3) Estimates of fishing mortality in non-groundfish fisheries are based on historical catch and projected fishing activities.

      (4) EFPs are authorized and governed by regulations at §§ 660.60(f) and 600.745.

      (c)  (1) Species/species groups and areas allocated between the trawl and non-trawl fisheries are allocated based on the amounts and percentages in the table below. IFQ species not listed in the table below are allocated between the trawl and non-trawl fisheries through the biennial harvest specifications process.

      (i)  The allocation for the limited entry trawl fishery is derived by applying the trawl allocation amounts and percentages as specified in paragraph (c) of this section and as specified during the biennial harvest specifications process to the fishery harvest guideline for species/species groups and areas. For IFQ species the trawl allocation is further subdivided within each of the trawl sectors (MS, C/P, and IFQ) as specified in § 660.140, 660.150, and 660.160 of subpart D. The whiting allocation is further subdivided among the trawl sectors as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (ii)  For each species/species group and area, the non-trawl fishery allocation is derived by subtracting from the corresponding harvest guideline the trawl allocations specified in paragraph (c) of this section and during the biennial harvest specifications. The non-trawl allocation will be shared between the limited entry fixed gear, open access, and recreational fisheries as specified through the biennial harvest specifications process and consistent with allocations in the PCGFMP.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (d)  To derive the commercial harvest guideline, the fishery harvest guideline is further reduced by the recreational set-asides. The commercial harvest guideline is then allocated between the limited entry fishery (both trawl and fixed gear) and the directed open access fishery, as appropriate.

      (e) —(1)  The allocations between the limited entry and open access fisheries are based on standards from the PCGFMP.

      (2)  For species with LE/OA allocations that are not subject to Amendment 21 allocations, the allocation between the limited entry (both trawl and fixed gear) and the open access fisheries is determined by applying the percentage for those species with a LE/OA allocation to the commercial harvest guideline plus the amount set-aside for the non-groundfish fisheries.

      (i)  The allocation for the limited entry fishery is the commercial harvest guideline minus any allocation to the directed open access fishery.

      (ii)  The allocation for the open access fishery is derived by applying the open access allocation percentage to the annual commercial harvest guideline or quota plus the non-groundfish fishery ( incidental open access fishery) amount described in paragraph (b) of this section. The result is the total open access allocation. The portion that is set-aside for the non-groundfish fisheries is deducted and the remainder is the directed open access portion. For management areas or stocks for which quotas or harvest guidelines for a stock are not fully utilized, no separate allocation will be established for the open access fishery until it is projected that the allowable catch for a species will be reached.

      (A)  For each species with a harvest guideline or quota, the initial open access allocation percentage is calculated by:

      () Computing the total catch for that species during the window period (July _1_1, 1984 through August 1, 1988) for the limited entry program by any vessel that did not initially receive a limited entry permit.

      () Dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period by all gear.

      () The guidelines in this paragraph apply to recalculation of the open access allocation percentage. Any recalculated allocation percentage will be used in calculating the following biennial fishing period's open access allocation.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (f)  Catch accounting refers to how the catch in a fishery is monitored against the allocations described in this section. For species with trawl/non-trawl allocations, catch of those species are counted against the trawl/non-trawl allocations as explained in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For species with limited entry/open access allocations in a given biennial cycle, catch of those species are counted against the limited entry/open access allocations as explained in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (1) —(i)  Any groundfish caught by a vessel registered to a limited entry trawl-endorsed permit will be counted against the trawl allocation while they are declared in to a groundfish limited entry trawl fishery and while the applicable trawl fishery listed in subpart D of this part for that vessel's limited entry permit is open.

      (ii)  All groundfish caught by a vessel not registered to a limited entry permit and not fishing in the non-groundfish fishery will be counted against the non-trawl allocation. All groundfish caught by a vessel registered to a limited entry permit when the fishery for a vessel's limited entry permit has closed or they are not declared in to a limited entry fishery, will be counted against the non-trawl allocation, unless they are declared in to a non-groundfish fishery. Catch by vessels fishing in the non-groundfish fishery, as defined at § 660.11, will be accounted for in the estimated mortality in the non-groundfish fishery that is deducted from the ACL or ACT when specified.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (g)  Recreational fishing for groundfish is outside the scope of, and not affected by, the regulations governing limited entry and open access fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish will be set aside for the recreational fishery during the biennial specifications process. These amounts will be estimated prior to dividing the commercial harvest guideline between the limited entry and open access fisheries.

      (h)  The allocations of sablefish north of 36° N. lat. described in paragraph (h) of this section are specified in Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP.

      (1)  The sablefish allocation to Pacific coast treaty Indian tribes is identified at § 660.50(f)(2). The remainder is available to the nontribal fishery (limited entry, open access (directed and incidental), and research).

      (2)  The allocation of sablefish after tribal deductions is further reduced by the estimated total mortality of sablefish in research and recreational fisheries; the remaining yield (commercial harvest guideline) is divided between open access and limited entry fisheries. The limited entry fishery allocation is 90.6 percent of the commercial harvest guideline. The open access allocation is 9.4 percent of the commercial harvest guideline and includes incidental catch in non-groundfish fisheries, or incidental open access.

      (3)  The limited entry sablefish allocation is further allocated 58 percent to the trawl fishery and 42 percent to the limited entry fixed gear (longline and pot/trap) fishery.

      (4)  Within the limited entry fixed gear fishery allocation, 85 percent is reserved for the primary season described in § 660.231, subpart E, leaving 15 percent for the limited entry daily trip limit fishery described in § 660.232, subpart E.

      (5)  The Regional Administrator will biennially or annually calculate the size of the cumulative trip limit for each of the three tiers associated with the sablefish endorsement such that the ratio of limits between the tiers is approximately 1:1.75:3.85 for Tier 3:Tier 2:Tier 1, respectively. The size of the cumulative trip limits will vary depending on the amount of sablefish available for the primary fishery and on estimated discard mortality rates within the fishery. The size of the cumulative trip limits for the three tiers in the primary fishery will be announced in § 660.231(b)(3), subpart E.

      (i)  The allocation structure and percentages for Pacific whiting are described in the PCGFMP.

      (1) Annual treaty tribal Pacific whiting allocations are provided in § 660.50, subpart C.

      (2) The fishery harvest guideline for Pacific whiting is allocated among three sectors, as follows: 34 percent for the C/P Co-op Program; 24 percent for the MS Co-op Program; and 42 percent for the Shorebased IFQ Program. No more than 5 percent of the Shorebased IFQ Program allocation may be taken and retained south of 42° N lat. before the start of the primary Pacific whiting season north of 42° N lat. Specific sector allocations for a given calendar year are found in tables 1a through c and 2a through c of this subpart. Set-asides for other species for the at-sea whiting fishery for a given calendar year are established through the biennial specifications process.

      (j)  Annual set-asides are not formal allocations but they are amounts which are not available to the other fisheries during the fishing year. For Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, set-asides will be deducted from the TAC, OY, ACL, or ACT when specified. For the catcher/processor and mothership sectors of the at-sea Pacific whiting fishery, set-asides will be deducted from the limited entry trawl fishery allocation. Set-aside amounts may be adjusted through the biennial harvest specifications and management measures process.

      (k) [Reserved]

      (l)  The commercial tribal harvest guideline for black rockfish off Washington State is specified at § 660.50(f)(1), subpart C.

      (m)  The Pacific halibut fishery off Washington, Oregon and California (Area 2A in the halibut regulations) is managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 300, subpart E. The PCGFMP sets the trawl bycatch mortality limit at 15 percent of the Area 2A total constant exploitation yield (TCEY) for legal size halibut (net weight), not to exceed 130,000 pounds annually for legal size halibut (net weight) for 2012 through 2014 and, beginning in 2015, not to exceed 100,000 pounds annually for legal size halibut (net weight). The TCEY used for these calculations will be the best estimate of the TCEY available from the International Pacific Halibut Commission at the time of the calculation. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “legal sized” halibut refers to halibut with a total length of 32 inches and above, or O32, and the term “sublegal sized” halibut refers to halibut under 32 inches in total length, or U32. To determine the trawl bycatch mortality limit, the pounds of halibut available to the trawl fleet will be expanded from the legal sized halibut mortality (net weight) to a round weight legal and sublegal sized amount. To convert from net weight to round weight, multiply by the conversion factor used by the International Pacific Halibut Commission at the time of calculation for net weight to round weight. To convert from legal sized halibut to legal and sublegal sized halibut, multiply by the conversion factor from the NMFS trawl fishery bycatch report as reported to the International Pacific Halibut Commission at the time of calculation for legal sized to legal and sublegal sized halibut. The bycatch allocation percent can be adjusted downward or upward through the biennial specifications and management measures process but the upper bound on the maximum pounds of allocation can only be changed though an FMP amendment. Part of the overall total mortality limit is a set-aside of 10 mt of Pacific halibut (legal and sublegal, round weight), to accommodate bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fishery and in the shorebased trawl fishery south of 40°10′ N. lat. (estimated to be approximately 5 mt each). This set-aside can be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process.

      § 660.60   Specifications and management measures.

#### § § 660.60

      (a)  NMFS will establish and adjust specifications and management measures biennially or annually and during the fishing year. Management of the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery will be conducted consistent with the standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and other applicable law. The PCGFMP is available from the Regional Administrator or the Council. Regulations under this subpart may be promulgated, removed, or revised during the fishing year. Any such action will be made according to the framework standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and other applicable law, and will be published in the

      (b)  The Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery is managed on a biennial, calendar year basis. Harvest specifications and management measures will be announced biennially, with the harvest specifications for each species or species group set for two sequential calendar years. In general, management measures are designed to achieve, but not exceed, the specifications, particularly optimum yields (harvest guidelines and quotas), fishery harvest guidelines, commercial harvest guidelines and quotas, limited entry and open access allocations, or other approved fishery allocations, and to protect overfished and depleted stocks. Management measures will be designed to take into account the co-occurrence ratios of target species with overfished species, and will select measures that will minimize bycatch to the extent practicable.

      (1) Except for Pacific whiting, every biennium, NMFS will implement OFLs, ABCs, and ACLs, if applicable, for each species or species group based on the harvest controls used in the previous biennium (referred to as default harvest control rules) applied to the best available scientific information. The default harvest control rules for each species or species group are listed in the biennial SAFE document. NMFS may implement OFLs, ABCs, and ACLs, if applicable, that vary from the default harvest control rules based on a Council recommendation.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (c)  Catch restrictions that are likely to be adjusted on a biennial, or more frequent, basis may be imposed and announced by a single notification in the  if good cause exists under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to waive notice and comment, and if they have been designated as routine through the two-meeting process described in the PCGFMP. Routine management measures that may be revised during the fishing year, via this process, are implemented in paragraph (h) of this section, and in subparts C through G of this part, including tables 1a through 1c, and 2a through 2c to subpart C of this part, tables 1a and 1b (North) and tables 1a and 1b (South) of subpart D of this part, tables 2a and 2b (North) and tables 2a and 2b (South) of subpart E of this part, and tables 3a and 3b (North) and tables 3a and 3b (South) of subpart F of this part. Most trip, bag, and size limits, and some Groundfish Conservation Area closures in the groundfish fishery have been designated “routine,” which means they may be changed rapidly after a single Council meeting. Council meetings are held in the months of March, April, June, September, and November. Inseason changes to routine management measures are announced in the  pursuant to the requirements of the APA. Changes to trip limits are effective at the times stated in the  Once a trip limit change is effective, it is illegal to take and retain, possess, or land more fish than allowed under the new trip limit. This means that, unless otherwise announced in the  offloading must begin before the time a fishery closes or a more restrictive trip limit takes effect. The following catch restrictions have been designated as routine:

      (1) —(i)  Trip landing and frequency limits have been designated as routine for the following species or species groups: Widow rockfish, canary rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, yelloweye rockfish, black rockfish, blue/deacon rockfish, splitnose rockfish, blackgill rockfish in the area south of 40°10′ N lat., chilipepper, bocaccio, cowcod, Minor Nearshore Rockfish or shallow and deeper Minor Nearshore Rockfish, shelf or Minor Shelf Rockfish, and Minor Slope Rockfish; Dover sole, sablefish, shortspine thornyheads, and longspine thornyheads; petrale sole, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, Pacific sanddabs, big skate, and the Other Flatfish complex, which is composed of those species plus any other flatfish species listed at § 660.11; Pacific whiting; lingcod; Pacific cod; Pacific spiny dogfish; longnose skate; cabezon in Oregon and California; and “Other Fish” as defined at § 660.11. In addition to the species and species groups listed above, sub-limits or aggregate limits may be specified, specific to the Shorebased IFQ Program, for the following species: big skate, California skate, California scorpionfish, leopard shark, soupfin shark, finescale codling, Pacific rattail (grenadier), ratfish, kelp greenling, shortbelly rockfish, and cabezon in Washington. Size limits have been designated as routine for sablefish and lingcod. Trip landing and frequency limits and size limits for species with those limits designated as routine may be imposed or adjusted on a biennial or more frequent basis for the purpose of keeping landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS.

      (ii)  Trip landing and frequency limits that differ by gear type and closed seasons may be imposed or adjusted on a biennial or more frequent basis for the purpose of rebuilding and protecting overfished or depleted stocks.

      (iii)  Limits on the type of limited entry trawl gear on board a vessel may be imposed on a biennial or more frequent basis. Requirements and restrictions on limited entry trawl gear type are found at § 660.130(b).

      (iv)  As specified at § 660.140(h)(1)(i), to be exempt from observer coverage while docked in port depends on documentation of specified retained IFQ species on the Observer Program reporting form. The list of IFQ species documented on the Observer Program form may be modified on a biennial or more frequent basis under routine management measures § 660.60(c)(1).

      (v)  As specified at § 660.140(e)(5)(i), a percentage of surplus QP or IBQ pounds in a vessel account may be carried over from one year to the next. The percentage of surplus QP or IBQ pounds, that may be carried over may be modified on a biennial or more frequent basis, and may not be higher than 10 percent.

      (2)  Routine management measures for all groundfish species, separately or in any combination, include bag limits, size limits, time/area closures, boat limits, hook limits, and dressing requirements. All routine management measures on recreational fisheries are intended to keep landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS, to rebuild and protect overfished or depleted species, and to maintain consistency with State regulations, and for the other purposes set forth in this section.

      (i)  To spread the available catch over a large number of anglers; to protect and rebuild overfished species; to avoid waste.

      (ii)  To protect juvenile fish; to protect and rebuild overfished species; to enhance the quality of the recreational fishing experience.

      (iii)  To spread the available catch over a large number of anglers; to protect and rebuild overfished species; to avoid waste; to enhance the quality of the recreational fishing experience.

      (3) —(i)  Depth-based management measures, particularly closed areas known as Groundfish Conservation Areas, defined in § 660.11, include RCAs, BRAs, and BACs, and may be implemented in any fishery sector and/or for any gear type that takes groundfish directly or incidentally. Depth-based management measures are set using specific boundary lines that approximate depth contours with latitude/longitude waypoints found at §§ 660.70 through 660.74 and 660.76 or the EEZ. Depth-based management measures and closed areas may be used for the following conservation objectives: To protect and rebuild overfished or rebuilding stocks; to prevent the overfishing of any groundfish species by minimizing the direct or incidental catch of that species; or to minimize the incidental harvest of any protected or prohibited species taken in the groundfish fishery. Depth-based management measures and closed areas may be used for the following economic objectives: To extend the fishing season; for the commercial fisheries, to minimize disruption of traditional fishing and marketing patterns; for the recreational fisheries, to spread the available catch over a large number of anglers; to discourage target fishing while allowing small incidental catches to be landed; and to allow small fisheries to operate outside the normal season.

      (A)  RCAs, as defined at sect; 660.11, may be modified as routine action for vessels using trawl gear (off Washington), non-trawl gear (coastwide), or recreational gear (coastwide) consistent with the purposes described in this paragraph (c)(3)(i).

      (B)  BRAs may be implemented through automatic action in the Pacific whiting fishery consistent with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. BRAs may be implemented as routine management measures for vessels using midwater groundfish trawl gear consistent with the purposes described in this paragraph (c)(3)(i).

      (C)  BACs, as defined at § 660.11, may be closed or reopened, in the EEZ off Washington, Oregon, and California, for vessels taking and retaining groundfish using any gear (trawl or non-trawl) in the EEZ consistent with the purposes described in this paragraph (c)(3)(i).

      (ii)  Changes to the non-tribal amounts deducted from the TAC, ACLs, or ACT when specified, described at § 660.55(b)(2) through (4) and specified in the footnotes to Tables 1a through 1c, and 2a through 2c, to subpart C, have been designated as routine to make fish that would otherwise go unharvested available to other fisheries during the fishing year. Adjustments may be made to provide additional harvest opportunities in groundfish fisheries when catch in scientific research activities, non-groundfish fisheries, and EFPs are lower than the amounts that were initially deducted off the TAC, ACL, or ACT when specified, during the biennial specifications or to allocate yield from the deduction to account for unforeseen catch events to groundfish fisheries. When recommending adjustments to the non-tribal deductions, the Council shall consider the allocation framework criteria outlined in the PCGFMP and the objectives to maintain or extend fishing and marketing opportunities taking into account the best available fishery information on sector needs.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator, NMFS West Coast Region, after consultation with the Chairman of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Fishery Director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, or their designees, is authorized to modify the following designated routine management measures for canary rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, and black rockfish off the coast of California. For black rockfish in commercial fisheries trip landing and frequency limits; and depth based management measures. For black, canary, and yelloweye rockfish in recreational fisheries bag limits; time/area closures; depth based management. Any modifications may be made only after NMFS has determined that a California state-specific federal harvest limit for canary rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, or black rockfish, is attained or projected to be attained prior to the first day of the next Council meeting. Any modifications may only be used to restrict catch of canary rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, or black rockfish off the coast of California.

      (d)  The NMFS Regional Administrator or designee will initiate automatic management actions without prior public notice, opportunity to comment, or a Council meeting. These actions are nondiscretionary, and the impacts must have been taken into account prior to the action. Unless otherwise stated, a single notice will be published in the  making the action effective if good cause exists under the APA to waive notice and comment.

      (1) Automatic actions will be initiated in the following circumstances:

      (i) Close the MS or C/P sector when that sector's Pacific whiting allocation is reached, or is projected to be reached. The MS sector non-cooperative fishery will be closed by automatic action when the Pacific whiting or non-whiting allocation to the non-cooperative fishery has been reached or is projected to be reached.

      (ii) Close one or both MS and C/P sectors when a non-whiting groundfish species with allocations is reached or projected to be reached.

      (iii) Reapportion the unused portion of the tribal allocation of Pacific whiting to the MS sector, C/P sector, and Shorebased IFQ sector.

      (iv) Close the following groundfish fisheries, not including Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, when conditions for Chinook salmon bycatch described in this table and paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section are met:

      (A) Consistent with § 660.60(i)(2), each component of the whiting sector (Pacific whiting IFQ fishery, MS Co-op Program and C/P Co-op Program) will be closed when Chinook salmon bycatch exceeds 11,000 Chinook salmon if a routine management measure specified at § 660.60(c) has not been implemented as described in § 660.60(i)(2) for that individual component of the whiting sector.

      (B) Consistent with § 660.60(i)(2), the Chinook salmon closure at 11,000 fish does not apply to those whiting sector vessels that are parties to an approved Salmon Mitigation Plan, as specified at § 660.113(e), unless the non-whiting sector has caught the entire 3,500 Chinook salmon bycatch reserve.

      (v) Close all groundfish fisheries, including Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, if Chinook salmon bycatch in the groundfish fishery exceeds 20,000 fish.

      (vi) Implement BRAs, described at § 660.131, when NMFS projects a sector-specific allocation will be reached before the sector's whiting allocation.

      (2) Automatic actions are effective when actual notice is sent by NMFS identifying the effective time and date. Actual notice to fishers and processors will be by email, internet (), phone, letter, or press release. Allocation reapportionments will be followed by publication in the  in which public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.

      (e) [Reserved]

      (f)  (1) The Regional Administrator may issue EFPs under regulations at § 660.30, subpart C, for compensation with fish for collecting resource information. Such EFPs may include the collecting of scientific samples of groundfish species that would otherwise be prohibited for retention.

      (2) The Regional Administrator may also issue EFPs under regulations at 50 CFR part § 600.745 for limited testing, public display, data collection, exploratory, health and safety, environmental cleanup, and/or hazard removal purposes, the target or incidental harvest of species managed under an FMP or fishery regulations that would otherwise be prohibited.

      (3) U.S. vessels operating under an EFP are subject to restrictions in subparts C through G of this part unless otherwise provided in the permit.

      (g)  These specifications account for fish caught in state ocean waters (0-3 nm offshore) though that fishing activity is governed by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California, respectively. Catch of a stock in State waters is taken off the top of the harvest specifications for the stock in the EEZ (3-200 nm (5.6-370.4 km) offshore).

      (h) —(1)  Commercial trip limits and recreational bag and boat limits defined in tables 1a through 2d of this subpart, and those specified in subparts D through G of this part, including tables 1b (North) and 1b (South) of subpart D of this part, tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) of subpart E of this part, and tables 3b (North) and 3b (South) of subpart F of this part must not be exceeded.

      (2)  As stated at § 660.11 (in the definition of “Land or landing”), once the offloading of any species begins, all fish aboard the vessel are counted as part of the landing and must be reported as such. All fish from a landing must be removed from the vessel before a new fishing trip begins, except for processing vessels fishing in the catcher/processor or mothership sectors of the Pacific whiting fishery. Transfer of fish at sea is prohibited under § 660.12, unless a vessel is participating in the primary whiting fishery as part of the mothership or catcher/processor sectors, as described at § 660.131(a). Catcher vessels in the mothership sector must transfer all catch from a haul to the same vessel registered to an MS permit prior to the gear being set for a subsequent haul. Catch may not be transferred to a tender vessel.

      (3)  Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel that has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the limit for the next legal period, so long as no fish (including, but not limited to, groundfish with no trip limits, shrimp, prawns, or other nongroundfish species or shellfish) are landed (offloaded) until the next legal period. Fishing ahead is not allowed during or before a closed period.

      (4)  All weights are round weights or round-weight equivalents unless otherwise specified. Percentages are based on round weights, and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board.

      (5) —(i)  Unless otherwise specified, size limits in the commercial and recreational groundfish fisheries apply to the “total length,” which is the longest measurement of the fish without mutilation of the fish or the use of force to extend the length of the fish. No fish with a size limit may be retained if it is in such condition that its length has been extended or cannot be determined by these methods. For conversions not listed here, contact the state where the fish will be landed. Washington state regulations require all fish with a size limit landed into Washington to be landed with the head on.

      (A)  For a whole fish, total length is measured from the tip of the snout (mouth closed) to the tip of the tail in a natural, relaxed position.

      (B)  For a fish with the head removed (“headed”), the length is measured from the origin of the first dorsal fin (where the front dorsal fin meets the dorsal surface of the body closest to the head) to the tip of the upper lobe of the tail; the dorsal fin and tail must be left intact.

      (C)  A filet is the flesh from one side of a fish extending from the head to the tail, which has been removed from the body (head, tail, and backbone) in a single continuous piece. Filet lengths may be subject to size limits for some groundfish taken in the recreational fishery off California (see subpart G of this part). A filet is measured along the length of the longest part of the filet in a relaxed position; stretching or otherwise manipulating the filet to increase its length is not permitted.

      (ii)  To determine the round weight, multiply the processed weight times the conversion factor. Federal commercial groundfish regulations do not supersede more restrictive state commercial groundfish regulations, including landings requirements regarding groundfish species or the condition in which they may be landed.

      (A) Limited entry fixed gear or open access fisheries. The weight limit conversion factor established by the state where the fish is or will be landed will be used to convert the processed weight to round weight for purposes of applying the trip limit or other allocation. Weight conversions provided herein are those conversions currently in use by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California and may be subject to change by those states. Fishery participants should contact fishery enforcement officials in the state where the fish will be landed to determine that state's official conversion factor.

      ()  The following conversion applies to both the limited entry fixed gear and open access fisheries when trip limits are in effect for those fisheries. For headed and gutted (eviscerated) sablefish the weight conversion factor is _1_.6 (multiply the headed and gutted weight by 1.6 to determine the round weight).

      ()  The following conversions apply in both limited entry fixed gear and open access fisheries.

      () North of 42° N. lat., for l_i_ngcod with the head removed, the minimum size limit is 18 inches (46 cm), which corresponds to 22 inches (56 cm) total length for whole fish.

      () South of 42° N lat., for lingcod with the head removed, the minimum size limit is 18 inches (46 cm), which corresponds to 22 inches (56 cm) total length for whole fish.

      () The weight conversion factor for headed and gutted lingcod is 1.5. The conversion factor for lingcod that has only been gutted with the head on is 1.1.

      (B)  For vessels land_i_ng sorted catch, the weight conversions for purposes of applying QP and size limits are provided in paragraphs (h)(5)(ii)(B)()() through () of this section.

      ()  The weight conversion factor for headed and gutted (eviscerated) sablefish is _1_.6.

      ()  The following conversions and size limits apply:

      () The m_i_nimum size limit for lingcod North of 42° N. lat. is 22 inches (56 cm) total length for whole fish, which corresponds to 18 inches (46 cm) with the head removed.

      () The minimum size limit for lingcod South of 42° N lat. is 22 inches (56 cm) total length for whole fish, which corresponds to 18 inches (46 cm) with the head removed.

      () The weight conversion factor for headed and gutted (eviscerated) lingcod is 1.5; for lingcod that has only been gutted with the head on, the weight conversion factor is 1.1.

      ()  For headed and gutted Pacific whiting (head removed just in front of the collar bone and viscera removed,) the weight conversion factor is 1.56; and for headed and gutted Pacific whiting with the tail removed the weight conversion factor is 2.0.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.75; for headed and gutted, western cut (head removed just in front of the collar bone and viscera removed,) the weight conversion factor is 1.66; for headed and gutted, eastern cut (head removed just behind the collar bone and viscera removed,) the weight conversion factor is 2.0.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.6.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.58.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.53.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.51.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.35.

      ()  For headed and gutted (eviscerated), the weight conversion factor is 1.49.

      (6)  Trawl fishery sorting requirements are specified at § 660.130(d), subpart D. Limited entry fixed gear fishery sorting requirements are specified at § 660.230(c), subpart E, and Open access fishery sorting requirements are specified at § 660.330(c), subpart F.

      (7)  Crossover provisions apply to three activities: Fishing on different sides of a management line, fishing in both the limited entry and open access fisheries, or fishing in both the Shorebased IFQ Program and the limited entry fixed gear fishery. Fishery-specific crossover provisions can be found in subparts D through F of this part.

      (i)  Trip limits for a species or a species group may differ in different management areas along the coast. The following crossover provisions apply to vessels fishing in different geographical areas that have different cumulative or “per trip” trip limits for the same species or species group, with the following exceptions. Such crossover provisions do not apply to: IFQ species (defined at § 660.140(c), subpart D) for vessels that are declared into the Shorebased IFQ Program (see § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A), for valid Shorebased IFQ Program declarations); species that are subject only to daily trip limits; or to trip limits for black rockfish off Washington, as described at §§ 660.230(e) and 660.330(e).

      (A)  If a vessel takes and retains any groundfish species or species group of groundfish in an area where a more restrictive trip limit applies before fishing in an area where a more liberal trip limit (or no trip limit) applies, then that vessel is subject to the more restrictive trip limit for the entire period to which that trip limit applies, no matter where the fish are taken and retained, possessed, or landed.

      (B)  If a vessel takes and retains a groundfish species or species group in an area where a higher trip limit or no trip limit applies, and takes and retains, possesses or lands the same species or species group in an area where a more restrictive trip limit applies, that vessel is subject to the more restrictive trip limit for the entire period to which that trip limit applies, no matter where the fish are taken and retained, possessed, or landed.

      (C)  During the fishing year, NMFS may implement management measures for a species or species group that set different types of trip limits (for example, per trip limits versus cumulative trip limits) for different areas. If a vessel fishes for a species or species group that is managed with different types of trip limits in two different areas within the same cumulative limit period, then that vessel is subject to the most restrictive overall cumulative limit for that species, regardless of where fishing occurs.

      (D)  Several rockfish species are designated with species-specific limits on one side of the 40°10′ N lat. management line and are included as part of a rockfish complex on the other side of the line. A vessel that takes and retains fish from a rockfish complex (nearshore, shelf, or slope) on both sides of a management line during a single cumulative limit period is subject to the more restrictive cumulative limit for that rockfish complex during that period.

      () If a vessel takes and retains species from the slope rockfish complex north of 40°_1_0′ N lat., that vessel is also permitted to take and retain, possess or land splitnose rockfish up to its cumulative limit south of 40°10′ N lat., even if splitnose rockfish were a part of the landings from slope rockfish complex taken and retained north of 40°10′ N lat.

      () If a vessel takes and retains species from the slope rockfish complex south of 40°10′ N lat., that vessel is also permitted to take and retain, possess or land Pacific ocean perch up to its cumulative limit north of 40°10′ N lat., even if Pacific ocean perch were a part of the landings from slope rockfish complex taken and retained south of 40°10′ N lat.

      (ii) —

      (A)  Open access trip limits apply to any fishing conducted with open access gear, even if the vessel has a valid limited entry permit with an endorsement for another type of gear. A vessel that fishes in both the open access and limited entry fisheries is not entitled to two separate trip limits for the same species. If a vessel has a limited entry permit registered to it at any time during the trip limit period and uses open access gear, but the open access limit is smaller than the limited entry limit, the open access limit may not be exceeded and counts toward the limited entry allocation as established under the biennial groundfish harvest specifications. If a vessel has a limited entry permit registered to it at any time during the trip limit period and uses open access gear, but the open access limit is larger than the limited entry limit, the smaller limited entry limit applies, even if taken entirely with open access gear. These provisions do not apply to:

      () IFQ species (defined at § 660._1_40(c)) for vessels that are declared into the Shorebased IFQ Program (see § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)) for valid Shorebased IFQ Program declarations).

      () Vessels with a valid limited entry permit endorsed for bottom longline and/or pot gear fishing inside the Non-Trawl RCA with stationary vertical jig gear or groundfish troll gear as defined at § 660.3_2_0(b)(6). Vessels fishing with one of these two approved hook-and-line gear configurations may fish up to the limited entry fixed gear trip limits in table 2b (North) and table 2b (South) of subpart E, either inside or outside the Non-Trawl RCA. This provision only applies on fishing trips where the vessel made the appropriate declaration (specified at § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)).

      (B) —()  To fish with open access gear, defined at § 660._1_1, a vessel registered to a limited entry trawl permit must make the appropriate fishery declaration, as specified at § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A). In addition, a vessel registered to a limited entry trawl permit must remove the permit from their vessel, as specified at § 660.25(b)(4)(vi), unless the vessel will be fishing in the open access fishery under one of the following declarations specified at § 660.13(d):

      () Non-groundf_i_sh trawl gear for pink shrimp,

      () Non-groundfish trawl gear for ridgeback prawn,

      () Non-groundfish trawl gear for California halibut,

      () Non-groundfish trawl gear for sea cucumber,

      () Open access Dungeness crab pot/trap gear,

      () Open access HMS line gear,

      () Open access salmon troll gear,

      () Open access Coastal Pelagic Species net gear.

      ()  To fish with open access gear, defined at § 660.11, subpart C, a vessel registered to a limit entry fixed gear permit must make the appropriate open access declaration, as specified at § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A). Vessels registered to a sablefish-endorsed permit(s) fishing in the sablefish primary season (described at § 660._2_31, subpart E) may only fish with the gear(s) endorsed on their sablefish-endorsed permit(s) against those limits.

      ()  Vessels jointly registered (under the provisions at § 660._2_5(b)(4)(iv)(B)) may fish with open access gear (defined at § 660._1_1) if they meet the requirements of both paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(B)() and () of this section.

      (iii)

      (A)  If a vessel fishes in both the Shorebased IFQ Program and the limited entry fixed gear fishery during a cumulative limit period, they are subject to the most restrictive trip limits for non-IFQ species.

      (B)  If a vessel is jointly registered and one or more of the limited entry permits is sablefish endorsed, any sablefish landings made by a vessel declared into the limited entry fixed gear fishery after the start of the sablefish primary fishery count towards the tier limit(s), per regulations at § 660.232(a)(2), subpart E. Any sablefish landings made by a vessel declared into the Shorebased IFQ Program must be covered by quota pounds, per regulations at § 660.112(b), subpart D, and will not count towards the tier limit(s).

      (i)  Salmon bycatch is managed through routine management measures, salmon bycatch guidelines and a Chinook salmon bycatch reserve, and fisheries closures. For purposes of salmon bycatch management, the groundfish fishery is divided into the whiting sector and non-whiting sector and includes bycatch of Chinook salmon and coho salmon from both non-tribal fisheries and Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries. The non-whiting sector includes the Pacific Coast treaty Indian vessels that target Pacific coast groundfish species other than whiting, as well as non-tribal vessels that target Pacific coast groundfish species other than whiting in the midwater trawl, bottom trawl, and fixed gear fisheries under the Shorebased IFQ Program, limited entry fixed gear fisheries, open access fisheries as defined at § 660.11, and recreational fisheries subject to this provision as set out in § 660.360(d). The whiting sector is the Pacific whiting fishery, as defined in § 660.111, and includes the Pacific Coast treaty Indian vessels that target whiting, as well as non-tribal vessels that target whiting participating in the C/P Co-op Program, the MS Co-op Program, and the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery.

      (1)  Routine management measures specified at § 660.60(c) may be implemented to minimize Chinook salmon and/or coho salmon bycatch in the groundfish fishery. These measures may include BRAs, BACs, or a selective flatfish trawl gear requirement. These measures would not apply to vessels fishing in Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries.

      (i)  Routine management measures to manage salmon bycatch in the non-whiting sector include:

      (A) A BAC for bottom trawl or midwater trawl as specified at § 660.60(c)(3)(i).

      (B) A BRA for midwater trawl as specified at § 660.60(c)(3)(i).

      (C) A selective flatfish trawl gear requirement for bottom trawl.

      (ii) W Routine management measures to manage salmon bycatch in the whiting sector include:

      (A) A BAC as specified at § 660.60(c)(3)(i).

      (B) A BRA as specified at § 660.60(c)(3)(i).

      (2)  The Chinook salmon bycatch guideline for the non-whiting sector is 5,500 fish. The Chinook salmon bycatch guideline for the whiting sector is 11,000 fish. If a sector exceeds its Chinook salmon bycatch guideline, it may access a reserve of 3,500 Chinook salmon reserve provided action has been taken to minimize Chinook salmon bycatch as described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. For bycatch accounting purposes, all Chinook salmon bycatch from the groundfish fishery, including both non-tribal and Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, counts towards the applicable whiting or non-whiting sector bycatch guideline and the reserve.

      (i)  The non-whiting sector may only access the reserve if a measure described in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section has been implemented.

      (ii)  Each component of the whiting sector (Pacific whiting IFQ fishery, MS Co-op Program and C/P Co-op Program) may only access the reserve if a measure described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section has been implemented for that component of the whiting fishery. If a measure described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section has not been implemented for that component of the whiting fishery, vessels within that component that are parties to an approved Salmon Mitigation Plan (SMP), as specified at § 660.113(e), may access the reserve.

      (3)  Groundfish fisheries may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(iv) and (v).

      § 660.65   Groundfish harvest specifications.

#### § § 660.65

      Harvest specifications include OFLs, ABCs, and the designation of OYs and ACLs. Management measures necessary to keep catch within the ACL include ACTs, HGs, or quotas for species that need individual management, the allocation of fishery HGs between the trawl and non-trawl segments of the fishery, and the allocation of commercial HGs between the open access and limited entry segments of the fishery. These specifications account for fish caught in state ocean waters (0-3 nm (0-5.6 km) offshore), though that fishing activity is governed by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California respectively. Catch of a stock in State waters is taken off the top of the harvest specifications for the stock in the EEZ (3-200 nm (5.6-370.4 km) offshore). Harvest specifications are provided in tables 1a through 2d of this subpart.

      § 660.75   Essential Fish Habitat (EFH).

#### § § 660.75

      Essential fish habitat (EFH) is defined as those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity (16 U.S.C. 1802 (10)). EFH for Pacific Coast Groundfish includes all waters and substrate within areas with a depth less than or equal to 3,500 m (1,914 fm) shoreward to the mean higher high water level or the upriver extent of saltwater intrusion (defined as upstream and landward to where ocean-derived salts measure less than 0.5 parts per thousand during the period of average annual low flow). Seamounts in depths greater than 3,500 m (1,914 fm) are also included due to their ecological importance to groundfish. Geographically, EFH for Pacific Coast groundfish includes both a large band of marine waters that extends from the Northern edge of the EEZ at the U.S. border with Canada to the Southern edge of the EEZ at the U.S. border with Mexico, and inland within bays and estuaries. The seaward extent of EFH is consistent with the westward edge of the EEZ for areas approximately north of Cape Mendocino. Approximately south of Cape Mendocino, the 3500 m depth contour and EFH is substantially shoreward of the seaward boundary of the EEZ. There are also numerous discrete areas seaward of the main 3500 m depth contour where the ocean floor rises to depths less than 3500 m and therefore are also EFH. The seaward boundary of EFH and additional areas of EFH are defined by straight lines connecting a series of latitude and longitude coordinates in §§ 660.76 through 660.79.

      (a) The seaward boundary of EFH, with the exception of the areas in paragraphs (b) through (qq), is bounded by the EEZ combined with a straight line connecting all of the following points in the order stated:

    Subpart D—West Coast Groundfish—Limited Entry Trawl Fisheries

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 60897, Oct. 1, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

      § 660.100   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 660.100

      This subpart applies to the Pacific coast groundfish limited entry trawl fishery. Under the trawl rationalization program, the limited entry trawl fishery consists of the Shorebased IFQ Program, the MS Co-op Program, and the C/P Co-op Program. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the operation of any of the antitrust laws. The trawl rationalization program creates limited access privileges. These limited access privileges, including the QS or IBQ, QP or IBQ pounds, and catch history assignments, may be revoked, limited or modified at any time in accordance with the MSA—and do not create any right of compensation to the holder of the limited access privilege if it is revoked, limited, or modified. The trawl rationalization program does not create any right, title, or interest in or to any fish before the fish is harvested by the holder and shall be considered a grant of permission to the holder of the limited access privilege to engage in activities permitted by the trawl rationalization program.

> [75 FR 78383, Dec. 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 77271, Dec. 14, 2015; 88 FR 81358, Nov. 22, 2023]

      § 660.115   Trawl fishery—cost recovery program.

#### § § 660.115

      (a)  The cost recovery program collects mandatory fees of up to three percent of the ex-vessel value of fish harvested by sector under the trawl rationalization program in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. NMFS collects the fees to recover the actual costs directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of the trawl rationalization program. In addition to the requirements of this section, the following groundfish regulations also apply:

      (1) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C: § 660.11 Definitions and § 660.25 Permits.

      (2) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart D: § 660.111 Definitions, § 660.112 Trawl fishery prohibitions, § 660.113 Trawl fishery recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.140 Shorebased IFQ Program, § 660.150 MS Co-op Program, and § 660.160 C/P Co-op Program.

      (b)  The annual fee percentage by sector is calculated as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. NMFS will establish the fee percentage each year and will announce the fee percentage by sector in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The fee percentage must not exceed three percent of the ex-vessel value of fish harvested by sector under the trawl rationalization program pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).

      (1)  In the last quarter of each calendar year, NMFS will calculate the fee percentage by sector based on information from the previous fiscal year (defined at § 660.11). The fee percentage will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent and must not exceed three percent for each sector (Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op Program, and C/P Co-op Program). NMFS will use the following equation to annually determine the fee percentage by sector: Fee percentage = the lower of 3% or (DPC/V) × 100, where:

      (i) “DPC,” or direct program costs, are the actual incremental costs for the previous fiscal year directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of each sector (Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op Program, and C/P Co-op Program). Actual incremental costs means those net costs that would not have been incurred but for the implementation of the trawl rationalization program, including additional costs for new requirements of the program and reduced trawl sector related costs resulting from efficiencies as a result of the program. If the amount of fees collected by NMFS is greater or less than the actual net incremental costs incurred, the DPC will be adjusted accordingly for calculation of the fee percentage in the following year.

      (ii) “V” is, for each applicable sector, the total ex-vessel value, as defined at § 660.111, from the previous calendar year attributable to that sector of the trawl rationalization program (Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op Program, and C/P Co-op Program).

      (2)  During the last quarter of each calendar year, NMFS will announce the following through a  notice:

      (i) The fee percentage to be applied by fish buyers and fish sellers, for each sector, that will be in effect for the upcoming calendar year, and

      (ii) The average MS price per pound from the previous fiscal year as reported for the MS Co-op Program to be used in the C/P Co-op Program to calculate the fee amount for the upcoming calendar year as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (iii) Information on how to pay in to the Fund subaccount as specified at paragraph (d) of this section.

      (c)  The fee amount is the ex-vessel value, as defined at § 660.111, for each sector multiplied by the fee percentage for that sector as announced in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (d) —(1)  Payment of fees at the fee percentage rate announced in paragraph (b)(2) of this section begins January 1 and continues without interruption through December 31 each year.

      (i)  Except as described below, the full fee is due and payable at the time of fish landing/delivery. Each fish buyer must collect the fee at the time of fish landing/delivery by deducting the fee from the ex-vessel value before paying the net ex-vessel value to the fish seller. Each fish seller must pay the fee at the time of fish landing/delivery by receiving from the fish buyer the net ex-vessel value, as defined at § 660.111.

      (A) In the event of any post-delivery payment for fish, the fish seller must pay, and the fish buyer must collect, at the time the amount of such post-landing/delivery payment, the fee that would otherwise have been due and payable at the time of initial fish landing/delivery.

      (B) When the fish buyer and fish seller are the same entity, that entity must comply with the requirements for both the fish seller and the fish buyer as specified in this section.

      (ii) —(A)  Each fish buyer shall maintain a segregated account at a federally insured financial institution for the sole purpose of depositing collected fee revenue from the cost recovery program specified in this section and disbursing the deposit principal directly to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.

      (B)  Each fish buyer, no less frequently than at the end of each month, shall deposit, in the deposit account established under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all fees collected, not previously deposited, that the fish buyer collects through a date not more than two calendar days before the date of deposit. The deposit principal may not be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose other than aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the Fund in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. The fish buyer is entitled, at any time, to withdraw deposit interest, if any, but never deposit principal, from the deposit account for the fish buyer's own use and purposes. If the fish buyer has used a credit card to pay the cost recovery fee, the deposit principal may be used to reimburse the credit card in the same amount as the fee payment.

      (C)  Not later than the 14th calendar day after the last calendar day of each month, or more frequently if the amount in the account exceeds the account limit for insurance purposes, the fish buyer shall disburse to NMFS the full deposit principal then in the deposit account. The fish buyer shall disburse deposit principal by electronic payment to the Fund subaccount to which the deposit principal relates. If the fish buyer has used a credit card to pay the cost recovery fee, the deposit principal may be used to reimburse the credit card in the same amount as the fee payment. NMFS will announce information about how to make an electronic payment to the Fund subaccount in the notification on fee percentage specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each disbursement must be accompanied by a cost recovery form provided by NMFS. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements are specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and at § 660.113(b)(5) for the Shorebased IFQ Program and § 660.113(c)(5) for the MS Co-op Program. The cost recovery form will be available on the  website.

      (2)  Payment of fees for the calendar year at the fee percentage rate announced in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is due in the last quarter of the calendar year and no later than December 31 each year. The fish buyer is responsible for fee payment to NMFS. The fish seller and the fish buyer, as defined at § 660.111, are considered the same entity in the C/P Co-op Program. The fish buyer shall disburse to NMFS the full fee amount for the calendar year by electronic payment to the Fund subaccount. NMFS will announce information about how to make an electronic payment to the Fund subaccount in the notification on fee percentage specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each disbursement must be accompanied by a cost recovery form provided by NMFS. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements are specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and at § 660.113(d)(5) for the C/P Co-op Program. The cost recovery form will be available on the pay.gov Web site.

      (3) —(i)  (A) If a fish buyer fails to collect the fee in the amount and manner required by this section, the fish seller shall then advise the fish buyer of the fish seller's fee payment obligation and of the fish buyer's cost recovery fee collection obligation. If the fish buyer still fails to properly collect the fee, the fish seller, within the next 7 calendar days, shall forward the fee to NMFS. The fish seller at the same time shall also advise NMFS in writing at the address in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section of the full particulars, including:

      () The fish buyer's and fish seller's name, address, and telephone number,

      () The name of the fishing vessel from which the fish seller made fish delivery and the date of doing so,

      () The weight and ex-vessel value of each species of fish that the fish seller delivered, and

      () The fish buyer's reason, if known, for failing or refusing to collect the fee in accordance with this subpart;

      (B) Notifications must be mailed or faxed to: National Marine Fisheries Service, West Coast Region, Office of Management and Information, ATTN: Cost Recovery Notification, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115; Fax: 206-526-6426; or delivered to National Marine Fisheries Service at the same address.

      (ii)  If NMFS determines the fish buyer or other responsible party has not submitted a complete cost recovery form and corresponding payment by the due date specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, NMFS will at any time thereafter notify the fish buyer or other responsible party in writing via an initial administrative determination (IAD) letter.

      (A)  In the IAD, NMFS will state the discrepancy and provide the person 30 calendar days to either pay the specified amount due or appeal the IAD in writing.

      (B)  If the fish buyer appeals an IAD, the appeal must be postmarked, faxed, or hand delivered to NMFS no later than 30 calendar days after the date on the IAD. If the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the next business day. The appeal must be in writing, must allege credible facts or circumstances, and must include any relevant information or documentation to support the appeal. Appeals must be mailed, faxed, or hand-delivered to: National Marine Fisheries Service, West Coast Region, Office of Management and Information, ATTN: Cost Recovery Appeals, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115; Fax: 206-526-6426; or delivered to National Marine Fisheries Service at the same address.

      (C) —()  For the appeal of an IAD, the Regional Administrator shall appoint an appeals officer. After determining there is sufficient information and that all procedural requirements have been met, the appeals officer will review the record and issue a recommendation on the appeal to the Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory only. The recommendation must be based solely on the record. Upon receiving the findings and recommendation, the Regional Administrator, acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, will issue a written decision on the appeal which is the final decision of the Secretary of Commerce.

      ()  If the fish buyer does not appeal the IAD within 30 calendar days, NMFS will notify the fish buyer or other responsible party in writing via a final decision letter. The final decision will be from the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      ()  the final decision will require payment within _3_0 calendar days. If such payment is not received within 30 calendar days of issuance of the final decision, NMFS will refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for purposes of collection. As of the date of the final decision if the fish buyer is out of compliance, NMFS will not approve a permit renewal for an MS permit or a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit until all cost recovery fees due have been paid as specified at § 660.25(b)(4)(i)(G); or reissue an IFQ first receiver site license until all cost recovery fees due have been paid, as specified at § 660.140(f)(4).

      (4) —(i)  Each fish buyer and fish seller shall retain records in accordance with § 660.113(a). In addition, fish buyers shall retain records in accordance with the following paragraphs: § 660.113(b)(5) for the Shorebased IFQ Program, § 660.113(c)(5) for the MS Co-op Program, and § 660.113(d)(5) for the C/P Co-op Program.

      § 660.130   Trawl fishery—management measures.

#### § § 660.130

      (a)  This section applies to the limited entry trawl fishery. Most species taken in the limited entry trawl fishery will be managed with quotas (see § 660.140), allocations or set-asides (see § 660.150 or § 660.160), or cumulative trip limits (see trip limits in tables 1b (North) and 1b (South) of this subpart), size limits (see § 660.60(h)(5)), seasons (see Pacific whiting at § 660.131(b)), gear restrictions (see paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) and closed areas (see paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section and §§ 660.70 through 660.79). The limited entry trawl fishery has gear requirements and harvest limits that differ by the type of groundfish trawl gear on board and the area fished. Groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception must adhere to CCA restrictions (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section and § 660.70). The trip limits in tables 1b (North) and 1b (South) of this subpart apply to vessels participating in the limited entry trawl fishery and may not be exceeded. Federal commercial groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state commercial groundfish regulations relating to federally managed groundfish.

      (b)  Trawl nets may be fished with or without otter boards, and may use warps or cables to herd fish.

      (1) —(i)  Lines or ropes that run parallel to the footrope may not be augmented with material encircling or tied along their length such that they have a diameter larger than 19 inches (48 cm). For enforcement purposes, the footrope will be measured in a straight line from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge at the widest part on any individual part, including any individual disk, roller, bobbin, or any other device.

      (ii)  Lines or ropes that run parallel to the footrope may not be augmented with material encircling or tied along their length such that they have a diameter larger than 8 inches (20 cm). For enforcement purposes, the footrope will be measured in a straight line from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge at the widest part on any individual part, including any individual disk, roller, bobbin, or any other device.

      (A)  Selective flatfish trawl gear is a type of small footrope trawl gear. The selective flatfish trawl net must be either a two-seamed or four-seamed net with no more than four riblines, excluding the codend. The breastline may not be longer than 3 ft (0.92 m) in length. There may be no floats along the center third of the headrope or attached to the top panel except on the riblines. The footrope must be less than 105 ft (32.26 m) in length. The headrope must be not less than 30 percent longer than the footrope. The headrope shall be measured along the length of the headrope from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge. An explanatory diagram of a selective flatfish trawl net is provided as Figure 1 of part 660, subpart D.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (2)  Midwater trawl gear must have unprotected footropes at the trawl mouth, and must not have rollers, bobbins, tires, wheels, rubber discs, or any similar device anywhere on any part of the net. The footrope of midwater gear may not be enlarged by encircling it with chains or by any other means. Ropes or lines running parallel to the footrope of midwater trawl gear must be bare and may not be suspended with chains or any other materials. Sweep lines, including the bottom leg of the bridle, must be bare. For at least 20 ft (6.15 m) immediately behind the footrope or headrope, bare ropes or mesh of 16-inch (40.6-cm) minimum mesh size must completely encircle the net.

      (c)  Management measures may vary depending on the type of trawl gear ( large footrope, small footrope, selective flatfish, or midwater trawl gear) used and/or on board a vessel during a fishing trip, cumulative limit period, and the area fished. Trawl nets may be used on and off the seabed. For some species or species groups, tables 1b (North) and 1b (South) of this subpart provide trip limits that are specific to different types of trawl gear: Large footrope, small footrope (including selective flatfish), selective flatfish, midwater, and multiple types. If tables 1a (North), 1b (North), 1a (South), and 1b (South) of this subpart provide gear specific limits or closed areas for a particular species or species group, prohibitions at §§ 660.12 and 660.112(a)(5) apply. Additional conservation areas applicable to vessels registered to limited entry permits with trawl endorsements are listed at paragraph (e) of this section.

      (1) —(i)  It is unlawful for any vessel using large footrope gear to fish for groundfish shoreward of the trawl RCA, defined at § 660.11 and with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.71 through 660.74. The use of large footrope gear is allowed where bottom trawling is allowed seaward of the trawl RCA.

      (ii)  It is unlawful for any vessel using large footrope gear to fish for groundfish shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73. The use of large footrope gear is allowed where bottom trawling is allowed seaward of the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour.

      (2)  The use of small footrope bottom trawl gear is allowed in all areas where bottom trawling is allowed with the following requirements:

      (i)  The use of selective flatfish trawl gear, a type of small footrope trawl gear, is allowed in all areas where bottom trawling is allowed. Selective flatfish trawl gear is required shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour between 42° N lat. and 40°10′ N lat. and fishing with all other types of small footrope trawl gear is prohibited in this area.

      (ii)  The use of small footrope trawl, other than selective flatfish trawl gear, is prohibited between 42° N lat. and 40°10′ N lat.

      (iii)  The use of small footrope trawl, other than of selective flatfish trawl gear, is prohibited inside the Klamath River Salmon Conservation Zone and the Columbia River Salmon Conservation Zone (defined at § 660.131(e)(8)).

      (3) —(i)  limited entry midwater trawl gear is required for vessels declared into the Pacific whiting fishery; limited entry midwater trawl gear is allowed for vessels declared into the non-whiting Shorebased IFQ Program during the Pacific whiting primary season.

      (ii)  vessels declared into limited entry midwater trawl are prohibited from operating, other than for the purpose of continuous transiting with prohibited gear stowed, shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 150 fm (274 m) depth contour, as defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73. Vessels declared limited entry midwater trawl may operate seaward of a boundary line approximating the 150 fm (274 m) depth contour. See also paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for additional restrictions.

      (4)  The trip limits in table 1b (North) or 1b (South) of this subpart must not be exceeded. A vessel may not have both groundfish trawl gear and non-groundfish trawl gear onboard simultaneously. A vessel may have more than one type of limited entry trawl gear on board (midwater, large or small footrope, including selective flatfish trawl), either simultaneously or successively, during a cumulative limit period except between 42° N lat. and 40°10′ N lat. as described in this section. If a vessel fishes both north and south of 40°10′ N lat. with any type of small or large footrope gear onboard the vessel at any time during the cumulative limit period, the most restrictive cumulative limit associated with the gear on board would apply for that trip and all catch would be counted toward that cumulative limit (see crossover provisions at § 660.60(h)(7)). When operating in an applicable GCA, all trawl gear must be stowed, consistent with prohibitions at § 660.112(a)(5)(i), unless authorized in this section.

      (i) —(A)  A vessel may have more than one type of limited entry bottom trawl gear on board (large or small footrope, including selective flatfish trawl), either simultaneously or successively, during a cumulative limit period with the following exception: between 42° N lat. and 40°10′ N lat. and shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73. In this area, vessels may not have any type of small footrope trawl gear other than selective flatfish trawl gear on board when fishing, per prohibitions at § 660.112(a)(5)(i).

      (B)  A vessel may have more than one type of midwater groundfish trawl gear on board, either simultaneously or successively, during a cumulative limit period.

      (C)  If a vessel fishes exclusively with selective flatfish trawl gear during an entire cumulative limit period, then the vessel is subject to the selective flatfish trawl gear-cumulative limits during that limit period, regardless of whether the vessel is fishing shoreward or seaward of the trawl RCA or the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73.

      (D)  If a vessel fishes exclusively with large or small footrope trawl gear during an entire cumulative limit period, the vessel is subject to the cumulative limits for that gear. If more than one type of groundfish bottom trawl gear (selective flatfish, large footrope, or small footrope) is on board, either simultaneously or successively, at any time during a cumulative limit period, then the most restrictive cumulative limit associated with the groundfish bottom trawl gear on board during that cumulative limit period applies for the entire cumulative limit period.

      (ii) —(A)  A vessel may have more than one type of limited entry bottom trawl gear on board (large or small footrope, including selective flatfish trawl), either simultaneously or successively, during a cumulative limit period.

      (B)  Vessels may not operate, other than transiting through, with limited entry midwater trawl gear on board that is not stowed, consistent with § 660.112(a)(5), in the area shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 150 fm (274 m) depth contour defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73. If a vessel fishes with limited entry bottom trawl gear in this area, vessels may have midwater trawl gear on board that is stowed, consistent with § 660.112(a)(5), and may fish seaward of the boundary line approximating the 150 fm (274 m) depth contour on the same trip with appropriate declaration changes. Vessels with groundfish on board harvested using limited entry midwater trawl gear may transit the area shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 150 fm (274 m) depth contour defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.73 if the midwater gear is stowed consistent with § 660.112(a)(5).

      (d)  In addition to the requirements at § 660.12(a)(8), the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipt. Sector-specific sorting requirements and exceptions are listed at paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.

      (1) —(i)  Widow rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, black rockfish, blue/deacon rockfish, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish, shortspine and longspine thornyhead, Dover sole, arrowtooth flounder, petrale sole, starry flounder, English sole, other flatfish, lingcod, sablefish, Pacific cod, spiny dogfish, other fish, longnose skate, Pacific whiting, and big skate.

      (ii)  POP, yellowtail rockfish, Washington cabezon/kelp greenling complex, Oregon cabezon/kelp greenling complex, cabezon off California; and

      (iii)  Minor shallow nearshore rockfish, minor deeper nearshore rockfish, California scorpionfish, chilipepper, bocaccio, splitnose rockfish, Pacific sanddabs, cowcod, bronzespotted rockfish, blackgill rockfish and cabezon.

      (2) —(i)  Fish landed at IFQ first receivers (including shoreside processing facilities and buying stations that intend to transport catch for processing elsewhere) must be sorted, prior to first weighing after offloading from the vessel and prior to transport away from the point of landing, with the following exception: Catch from a Pacific whiting IFQ trip may be sorted after weighing as specified at § 660.140(j)(2).

      (ii)  All catch must be sorted to the species groups specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for vessels with limited entry permits, except those engaged in maximized retention while declared into a Pacific whiting IFQ trip. The catch must not be discarded from the vessel and the vessel must not mix catch from hauls until the observer has sampled the catch, unless otherwise allowed under the EM Program requirements at § 660.604 of subpart J. Prohibited species must be sorted according to the following species groups: Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, Chinook salmon, other salmon. Non-groundfish species must be sorted as required by the state of landing.

      (3)  (i) Processing vessels in the MS and C/P Co-op Programs may use a bulk weighing scale in compliance with the equipment requirement at § 660.15(b) to derive an accurate total catch weight prior to sorting. Immediately following weighing of the total catch, the catch must be sorted to the species groups specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and all catch of-groundfish and non-groundfish species must be accurately accounted for and the weight of all catch other than a single predominant species deducted from the total catch weight to derive the weight of a single predominant species.

      (ii) If sorting occurs on a catcher vessel in the MS Co-op Program, the catch must not be discarded from the vessel and the vessel must not mix catch from hauls until the observer has sampled the catch, or unless otherwise allowed under the EM Program requirements at § 660.604 of subpart J.

      (e)  GCAs are closed areas, defined at § 660.11, and using latitude and longitude coordinates specified at §§ 660.70 through 660.74, and § 660.76.

      (1)  This closure applies to vessels with limited entry trawl gear on board. Limited entry trawl vessels may transit through the Western CCA within the transit corridor, defined at § 660.70.

      (2)  Commercial fishing for groundfish is prohibited in waters of depths less than 100-fm (183-m) around Cordell Bank, defined at § 660.70. Vessels may transit through with all trawl gear stowed.

      (3)  This GCA is off the coast of Washington, between the US/Canada border and 46°16′ N lat. Boundaries for the trawl RCA applicable to groundfish trawl vessels throughout the year are provided in the header to table 1a (North) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c). Prohibitions at § 660.112(a)(5) do not apply under the following conditions and when the vessel has a valid declaration for the allowed fishing:

      (4)  BACs, defined at § 660.111, are applicable to vessels with groundfish bottom trawl or midwater trawl gear on board that is not stowed, per the prohibitions in § 660.112(a)(5). When in effect, BACs are areas closed to bottom trawl and/or midwater trawl fishing. A vessel operating, for any purpose other than continuous transiting, in the BAC must have prohibited trawl gear stowed, as defined at § 660.111. Nothing in these Federal regulations supersedes any state regulations that may prohibit trawling shoreward of the fishery management area, defined at § 660.11. Prohibitions at § 660.112(a)(5) do not apply under any of the following conditions and when the vessel has a valid declaration for the allowed fishing:

      (i)  Limited entry midwater trawl gear and bottom trawl gear may be used within the BAC only when it is an authorized gear type for the area and season, and not prohibited by the BAC.

      (ii)  A vessel authorized to operate in a BAC may continuously transit through the BAC, with or without groundfish on board, with prohibited trawl gear stowed, as defined at § 660.111.

      (iii)  If a vessel fishes in a BAC with an authorized groundfish trawl gear, it may fish outside the BAC on the same trip using another authorized trawl gear type for that area and season, provided it makes the appropriate declaration change.

      (5)  Vessels using midwater groundfish trawl gear during the applicable Pacific whiting primary season may be prohibited from fishing shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 75 fm (137 m), 100 fm (183 m), 150 fm (274 m), or 200 fm (366 m) depth contours.

      (6)  No more than 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) of whiting may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished with midwater groundfish trawl gear in the fishery management area shoreward of the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour in the Eureka management area, defined at § 660.11. See also midwater trawl depth restrictions in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (7)  Fishing with midwater trawl gear and bottom trawl gear, other than selective flatfish trawl gear, is prohibited in the Klamath River Salmon Conservation Zone and the Columbia River Salmon Conservation Zone (defined at § 660.111).

      (f)  EFHCAs are defined at § 660.11 and at §§ 660.76 through 660.79. EFHCAs apply to vessels using bottom trawl gear or to vessels using bottom contact gear, defined at § 660.11. Vessels may transit through, with or without groundfish on board, with all prohibited gear stowed. EFHCAs closed to bottom trawl gear are listed at § 660.112(a)(5)(v). EFHCAs off California that are closed to bottom trawl gear, except vessels fishing with a valid declaration for demersal seine gear, are listed in § 660.112(a)(5)(vi). EFHCAs closed to bottom contact gear are listed at § 660.12(a)(4), (16) and (17).

      (g)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(iv) and (v).

      § 660.131   Pacific whiting fishery management measures.

#### § § 660.131

      (a)  This section applies to the MS sector, the C/P sector, the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery, and Shorebased IFQ vessels targeting Pacific whiting under trip limits outside the Pacific whiting primary season.

      (b) —(1)  (i) For the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery, the primary season is the period(s) of the large-scale Pacific whiting target fishery conducted after the primary season start date.

      (ii) For the C/P sector, the primary season is the period(s) when catching and at-sea processing are allowed (after the season closes, at-sea processing of any fish already on board the processing vessel is allowed to continue).

      (iii) For vessels delivering to motherships, the primary season is the period(s) when catching and at-sea processing is allowed for the MS sector (after the season closes, at-sea processing of any fish already on board the processing vessel is allowed to continue).

      (2)  North of 40°30′ N. lat., different primary season starting dates may be established for the C/P Co-op Program, the MS Co-op Program, and the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery for vessels delivering to IFQ first receivers north of 42° N. lat. and vessels delivering to IFQ first receivers between 42° and 40°30′ N. lat.

      (i)  The Pacific whiting primary seasons north of 40°30′ N. lat. generally will be established according to the procedures of the PCGFMP for developing and implementing harvest specifications and apportionments. The season opening dates remain in effect unless changed.

      (ii)  The start of a Pacific whiting primary season may be changed based on a recommendation from the Council and consideration of the following factors, if applicable: Size of the harvest guidelines for whiting and bycatch species; age/size structure of the whiting population; expected harvest of bycatch and prohibited species; availability and stock status of prohibited species; expected participation by catchers and processors; environmental conditions; timing of alternate or competing fisheries; industry agreement; fishing or processing rates; and other relevant information.

      (iii)  After the start of a primary season for a sector of the Pacific whiting fishery, the primary season remains open for that sector until the sector allocation of whiting or non-whiting groundfish (with allocations) is reached or projected to be reached and the primary season for that sector is closed by NMFS. The starting dates for the primary seasons are as follows:

      (A) Catcher/processor sector—May 1.

      (B) Mothership sector—May 1.

      (C)  The start of the Shorebased IFQ Program primary whiting season is:

      () North of 40°30′ N lat.—May _1_; and

      () South of 40°30′ N. lat.—April 15.

      (3)  For Shorebased IFQ Program vessels targeting Pacific whiting outside the primary season, the “per trip” limit for whiting is announced in table 1b of this subpart. The per-trip limit is a routine management measure under § 660.60(c). This trip limit includes any whiting caught shoreward of 100 fm (183 m) in the Eureka management area. The per-trip limit for other groundfish species are announced in tables 1b (North) and 1b (South) of this subpart and apply as follows:

      (i) During the groundfish cumulative limit periods both before and after the primary whiting season, vessels may use either small and/or large footrope gear, but are subject to the more restrictive trip limits for those entire cumulative periods.

      (ii) If a vessel on a Pacific whiting IFQ trip harvests a groundfish species other than whiting for which there is a midwater trip limit, then that vessel may also harvest up to another footrope-specific limit for that species during any cumulative limit period that overlaps the start or close of the primary season.

      (c)  The conservation areas described here are in addition to conservation areas applicable to vessels operating with midwater trawl gear on board described in § 660.130(c) and (e). Vessels fishing during the Pacific whiting primary seasons shall not target Pacific whiting with midwater groundfish trawl gear in the following portions of the fishery management area:

      (1)  defined at § 660.111.

      (2)  defined at § 660.111.

      (3)  Bycatch reduction area closures specified at § 660.130(e) may be implemented inseason through automatic action when NMFS projects that a Pacific whiting sector will exceed an allocation for a non-whiting groundfish species specified for that sector before the sector's whiting allocation is projected to be reached.

      (d)  Trip landing or frequency limits may be established, modified, or removed under § 660.60 or this paragraph, specifying the amount of Pacific whiting that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100 fathom (183 m) contour in the Eureka management area. Unless otherwise specified, no more than 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) of whiting may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100 fm (183 m) contour in the Eureka management area.

      (e)  Whiting may not be processed at sea south of 42°00′ N. lat. (Oregon-California border), unless by a waste-processing vessel as authorized under paragraph (g) of this section.

      (f)  Vessels fishing in the Pacific whiting primary seasons for the Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op Program or C/P Co-op Program shall not target Pacific whiting with midwater trawl gear in the fishery management area south of 42°00′ N. lat. between 0001 hours to one-half hour after official sunrise (local time). During this time south of 42°00′ N. lat., trawl doors must be on board any vessel used to fish for whiting and the trawl must be attached to the trawl doors. Official sunrise is determined, to the nearest 5° lat., in The Nautical Almanac issued annually by the Nautical Almanac Office, U.S. Naval Observatory, and available from the U.S. Government Printing Office.

      (g)  A vessel that processes only fish waste (a “waste-processing vessel”) is not considered a whiting processor and therefore is not subject to the allocations, seasons, or restrictions for catcher/processors or motherships while it operates as a waste-processing vessel. However, no vessel may operate as a waste-processing vessel 48 hours immediately before and after a primary season for whiting in which the vessel operates as a catcher/processor or mothership. A vessel must meet the following conditions to qualify as a waste-processing vessel:

      (1) The vessel makes meal (ground dried fish), oil, or minced (ground flesh) product, but does not make, and does not have on board, surimi (fish paste with additives), fillets (meat from the side of the fish, behind the head and in front of the tail), or headed and gutted fish (head and viscera removed).

      (2) The amount of whole whiting on board does not exceed the trip limit (if any) allowed under § 660.60(c) or table 1b (North) or 1b (South) in subpart D.

      (3) Any trawl net and doors on board are stowed in a secured and covered manner, and detached from all towing lines, so as to be rendered unusable for fishing.

      (4) The vessel does not receive codends containing fish.

      (5) The vessel's operations are consistent with applicable state and Federal law, including those governing disposal of fish waste at sea.

      (h)  (1) Upon receipt of written notice to the Regional Administrator from the tribe(s) participating in the fishery that they do not intend to use a portion of the tribal allocation, the Regional Administrator may, no earlier than 7 days following notice to other treaty tribes with rights to whiting, reapportion any remainder to the other sectors of the trawl fishery as soon as practicable after receiving such notice. If no such reapportionment has occurred prior to September 15 of the fishing year, the Regional Administrator will, based on discussions with representatives of the tribes participating in the Pacific whiting fishery for that fishing year, consider the tribal harvests to date and catch projections for the remainder of the year relative to the tribal allocation of Pacific whiting, as specified at § 660.50. That portion of the tribal allocation that the Regional Administrator determines will not be used by the end of the fishing year may be reapportioned to the other sectors of the trawl fishery on September 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. Subsequent reapportionments may be made based on subsequent determinations by the Regional Administrator based on the factors described above in order to ensure full utilization of the resource. However, no reapportionments will occur after December 1 of the fishing year.

      (2) The reapportionment of surplus whiting will be made by actual notice under the automatic action authority provided at § 660.60(d)(1).

      (3) The reapportionment of surplus whiting will be made effective immediately by actual notice under the automatic action authority provided at § 660.60(d)(1).

      (4) Estimates of the portion of the tribal allocation that will not be used by the end of the fishing year will be based on the best information available to the Regional Administrator.

      (i)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(v) and (vi).

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (5) Prior to reapportionment, NMFS will consider Chinook salmon take numbers and bycatch rates in each sector of the Pacific whiting fishery, in order to prevent a reapportionment that would limit Pacific Coast treaty Indian Tribes' access to the tribal allocation by triggering inseason closure of the Pacific whiting fishery as described at § 660.60(d)(1)(v).

      (i)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(v) and (vi).

      § 660.140   Shorebased IFQ Program.

#### § § 660.140

      (a)  The regulations in this section apply to the Shorebased IFQ Program. The Shorebased IFQ Program includes a system of transferable QS for most groundfish species or species groups, IBQ for Pacific halibut, and trip limits or set-asides for the remaining groundfish species or species groups. NMFS will issue a QS permit to eligible participants and will establish a QS account for each QS permit owner to track the amount of QS or IBQ and QP or IBQ pounds owned by that owner. QS permit owners may own QS or IBQ for IFQ species, expressed as a percent of the allocation to the Shorebased IFQ Program for that species. NMFS will issue QP or IBQ pounds to QS permit owners, expressed in pounds, on an annual basis, to be deposited in the corresponding QS account. NMFS will establish a vessel account for each eligible vessel owner participating in the Shorebased IFQ Program, which is independent of the QS permit and QS account. In order to use QP or IBQ pounds, a QS permit owner must transfer the QP or IBQ pounds from the QS account into the vessel account for the vessel to which the QP or IBQ pounds is to be assigned. Harvests of IFQ species may only be delivered to an IFQ first receiver with a first receiver site license. In addition to the requirements of this section, the Shorebased IFQ Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations of subparts C and D:

      (1) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C: § 660.11 Definitions, § 660.12 Prohibitions, § 660.13 Recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.14 VMS requirements, § 660.15 Equipment requirements, § 660.16 Groundfish observer program, § 660.20 Vessel and gear identification, § 660.25 Permits, § 660.55 Allocations, § 660.60 Specifications and management measures, § 660.65 Groundfish harvest specifications, and §§ 660.70 through 660.79 Closed areas.

      (2) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart D: § 660.111 Trawl fishery definitions, § 660.112 Trawl fishery prohibitions, § 660.113 Trawl fishery recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.115 Trawl fishery cost recovery program, § 660.120 Trawl fishery crossover provisions, § 660.130 Trawl fishery management measures, and § 660.131 Pacific whiting fishery management measures.

      (3) The Shorebased IFQ Program may be restricted or closed as a result of projected overages within the Shorebased IFQ Program, the MS Co-op Program, or the C/P Co-op Program. As determined necessary by the Regional Administrator, area restrictions, season closures, or other measures will be used to prevent the trawl sector in aggregate or the individual trawl sectors (Shorebased IFQ, MS Co-op, or C/P Co-op) from exceeding an ACL, OY, ACT or formal allocation specified in the PCGFMP or regulation at § 660.55, subpart C, or §§ 660.140, 660.150, or 660.160, subpart D.

      (b) —(1)  (i) Vessels must be registered to a groundfish limited entry permit, endorsed for trawl gear with no C/P endorsement.

      (ii) To start a fishing trip in the Shorebased IFQ Program, a vessel and its owner(s) (as described on the USCG documentation or state registration document) must be registered to the same vessel account established by NMFS with no deficit (negative balance) for any species/species group.

      (iii) All IFQ species/species group catch (landings and discards) must be covered by QP or IBQ pounds. Any deficit (negative balance in a vessel account) must be cured within 30 calendar days from the date the deficit from that trip is documented in the vessel account, unless the deficit is within the limits of the carryover provision at paragraph (e)(5) of this section, in which case the vessel account owner must declare out of the Shorebased IFQ Program, and must eliminate the deficit prior to re-entry into the fishery in the current year, or within 30 days after the issuance of QP or IBQ pounds for the following year.

      (iv) Any vessel with a deficit (negative balance) in its vessel account is prohibited from fishing that is within the scope of the Shorebased IFQ Program until sufficient QP or IBQ pounds are transferred into the vessel account to remove any deficit, regardless of the amount of the deficit.

      (v) A vessel account may not have QP or IBQ pounds (used and unused combined) in excess of the QP Vessel Limit in any year, and for species covered by Unused QP Vessel Limit, may not have QP or IBQ pounds in excess of the Unused QP Vessel Limit at any time. These amounts are specified at paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

      (vi) Vessels must use either trawl gear as specified at § 660.130(b), or a legal non-trawl groundfish gear under the gear switching provisions as specified at § 660.140(k).

      (vii) Vessels that are registered to MS/CV-endorsed permits may be used to fish in the Shorebased IFQ Program provided that the vessel is registered to a valid Shorebased IFQ Program vessel account.

      (viii) In the same calendar year, a vessel registered to a trawl endorsed limited entry permit with no MS/CV or C/P endorsements may be used to fish in the Shorebased IFQ Program if the vessel has a valid vessel account, and to fish in the mothership sector for a permitted MS co-op as authorized by the MS co-op.

      (ix) Vessels that are registered to C/P-endorsed permits may not be used to fish in the Shorebased IFQ Program.

      (x) Fish sellers must pay cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115.

      (2)  The IFQ first receiver must:

      (i) Ensure that all catch removed from a vessel making an IFQ delivery is weighed on a scale or scales meeting the requirements described in § 660.15(c).

      (ii) Ensure that all catch is landed, sorted, and weighed in accordance with a valid catch monitoring plan as described in § 660.140(f)(3)(iii).

      (iii) Ensure that all catch is sorted, prior to first weighing, as specified at § 660.130(d) and consistent with § 660.140(j)(2)(viii).

      (iv) Provide unrestricted access to all areas where fish are or may be sorted or weighed to catch monitors, NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers at any time when a delivery of IFQ species, or the processing of those species, is taking place.

      (v) Ensure that each scale produces a complete and accurate printed record of the weight of all catch in a delivery, unless exempted in the NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan.

      (vi) Retain and make available to catch monitors, NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers, all printed output from any scale used to weigh catch, and any hand tally sheets, worksheets, or notes used to determine the total weight of any species.

      (vii) Ensure that each delivery of IFQ catch is monitored by a catch monitor and that the catch monitor is on site the entire time the delivery is being weighed or sorted.

      (viii) Ensure that sorting and weighing is completed prior to catch leaving the area that can be monitored from the observation area described paragraph (i) of this section.

      (ix) Collect and remit to NMFS cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115.

      (c)

      (1)  IFQ management areas are as follows:

      (i) Between the U.S./Canada border and 40°10′ N lat.,

      (ii) Between 40°10′ N lat. and 36° N lat.,

      (iii) Between 36° N lat. and 34°27′ N lat., and

      (iv) Between 34°27′ N lat. and the U.S./Mexico border.

      (2)  A vessel using fixed gear declared into the limited entry groundfish non-trawl Shorebased IFQ fishery may deploy pot or trap gear in multiple IFQ management areas on a trip provided the vessel does not retrieve gear from more than one IFQ management area during a trip.

      (3)  Allocations for the Shorebased IFQ Program are determined for IFQ species as follows:

      (i) For Pacific whiting, the Shorebased IFQ Program allocation is specified at § 660.55(i)(2), subpart C, 42 percent.

      (ii) For Sablefish N. of 36° N. lat., the Shorebased IFQ Program allocation is the limited entry trawl allocation specified at § 660.55(h), subpart C, minus any set-asides for the mothership and C/P sectors for that species.

      (iii) For IFQ species listed in the trawl/non-trawl allocation table, specified at § 660.55(c), subpart C, allocations are determined by applying the trawl column percent to the fishery harvest guideline minus any set-asides for the mothership and C/P sectors for that species.

      (iv) The remaining IFQ species (bocaccio, canary rockfish, cowcod, darkblotched rockfish, lingcod S of 40°10′ N lat., minor shelf rockfish N of 40°10′ N lat., minor shelf rockfish S of 40°10′ N lat., and minor slope rockfish S of 40°10′ N lat., POP, widow rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish) are allocated through the biennial specifications and management measures process minus any set-asides for the mothership and C/P sectors for that species.

      (v) For Pacific halibut N. of 40°10′ N. lat., the Shorebased IFQ Program allocation is specified at 660.55(m).

      (vi) For each IFQ species, NMFS will determine annual sub-allocations to individual QS accounts by multiplying the percent of QS or IBQ registered to the account by the amount of each respective IFQ species allocated to the Shorebased IFQ Program for that year. For each IFQ species, NMFS will deposit QP or IBQ pounds in the respective QS account in the amount of each sub-allocation determined.

      (vii) —(A)

      ()  If at any time after the initial allocation, an IFQ species is geographically subdivided, those holding QS or IBQ for the IFQ species being subdivided will receive an amount of QS or IBQ for each newly created area that is equivalent to the amount they held for the area before it was subdivided.

      ()  When two areas are combined for an IFQ species, the QS or IBQ held by individuals in each area will be adjusted proportionally such that:

      () The total QS or IBQ for the area sums to 100 percent, and

      () A person holding QS or IBQ in the newly created area will receive the same amount of total QP or IBQ pounds as they would if the areas had not been combined.

      ()  When a management area boundary line is moved for an IFQ species, the QS or IBQ held by individuals in each area will be adjusted proportionally such that they each maintain their same share of the trawl allocation on a coastwide basis (a fishing area may expand or decrease, but the individual's QP or IBQ pounds for both areas combined wouldn't change because of the change in areas). In order to achieve this end, the holders of QS or IBQ in the area being reduced will receive QS or IBQ for the area being expanded, such that the total QP or IBQ pounds they would be issued will not be reduced as a result of the area reduction. Those holding QS or IBQ in the area being expanded will have their QS or IBQ reduced such that the total QP or IBQ pounds they receive in the year of the line movement will not increase as a result of the expansion (nor will it be reduced).

      (B)  If at any time after the initial allocation an IFQ species which is a species group is subdivided, each species or species group resulting from the subdivision will be an IFQ species. QS owners for the species group being subdivided will receive an amount of QS for each newly created IFQ species that is equivalent to the amount they held for the species group before it was subdivided. For example, if a person holds one percent of a species group before the subdivision, that person will hold one percent of the QS for each IFQ species resulting from the subdivision.

      (d) —(1)  In order to obtain QS and/or IBQ, a person must apply for a QS permit. NMFS will determine if the applicant is eligible to own QS and/or IBQ in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If eligible, NMFS will issue a QS permit, and will establish a QS account to track QS and IBQ balances for all IFQ species identified at § 660.140(c)(1). NMFS will issue initial allocations of QS and IBQ in accordance with paragraph (d)(8) of this section. Transfers of QS and IBQ, and of QP or IBQ pounds, are subject to provisions at paragraph (d)(3) of this section. QS permit owners can monitor the status of their QS and IBQ, and associated QP and IBQ pounds, throughout the year in their QS account.

      (i)  On or about January 1 each year, QS permit owners will be notified, via the IFQ Web site and their QS account, of any adjustments to their QS and/or IBQ allocations, for each of the IFQ species. Updated QS and/or IBQ values, if applicable, will reflect the results of: any recalculation of initial allocation formulas resulting from changes in provisional OYs used in the allocation formulas or appeals, any redistribution of QS and IBQ (e.g., resulting from permanent revocation of applicable permits, subject to accumulation limits), and any transfers of QS and/or IBQ made during the prior year.

      (ii)  QP and IBQ pounds will be deposited into QS accounts annually. QS permit owners will be notified of QP deposits via the IFQ website and their QS account. QP and IBQ pounds will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules ( decimal amounts less than 0.5 round down and 0.5 and greater round up). NMFS will distribute such allocations to the maximum extent practicable, not to exceed the total allocation. QS permit owners must transfer their QP and IBQ pounds from their QS account to a vessel account in order for those QP and IBQ pounds to be fished. QP and IBQ pounds must be transferred in whole pounds ( no fraction of a QP or IBQ pound can be transferred). All QP and IBQ pounds in a QS account must be transferred to a vessel account between January 1 and December 31 of the year for which they were issued in order to be fished.

      (A)  NMFS will issue QP for IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut annually by multiplying the QS permit owner's QS for each such IFQ species by that year's shorebased trawl allocation for that IFQ species. Deposits to QS accounts for IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut will be made on or about January 1 each year. Until the implementation of any regulatory changes developed pursuant to the first program review for the trawl rationalization program, the resulting AMP QP will be issued to all QS permit owners in proportion to their non-whiting QS.

      () In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are known by January _1_, deposits to QS accounts for IFQ species will be made on or about January 1.

      () In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are not known by January 1, NMFS will issue QP in two parts. On or about January 1, NMFS will deposit QP based on the shorebased trawl allocation multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for that year. After the final harvest specifications are established later in the year, NMFS will deposit additional QP to the QS account.

      () In years where the non-tribal deductions from the TAC, ACL, or ACT when specified, described at § 660.55(b), were too high and would go unharvested, NMFS may increase the shorebased trawl allocation, consistent with § 660.60(c), and issue additional QP to QS accounts.

      (B)  NMFS will issue QP for Pacific whiting annually by multiplying the QS permit owner's QS for Pacific whiting by that year's shorebased trawl allocation for Pacific whiting.

      () In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by January _1_, deposits to QS accounts for Pacific whiting will be made on or about January 1.

      () In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by January 1, NMFS will issue Pacific whiting QP in two parts. On or about January 1, NMFS will deposit Pacific whiting QP based on the shorebased trawl allocation multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established later in the year, NMFS will deposit additional QP to QS accounts.

      () In years where the non-tribal deductions from the TAC, ACL, or ACT when specified, described at § 660.55(b), were too high and would go unharvested, NMFS may increase the shorebased trawl allocation, consistent with § 660.60(c), and issue additional QP to QS accounts.

      () In years where there is reapportionment of Pacific whiting, specified at § 660.131(h), to the Shorebased IFQ Program, NMFS will increase the shorebased trawl allocation and issue additional QP to QS accounts as described at paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B)(3) of this section.

      (C)  NMFS will issue IBQ pounds for Pacific halibut annually by multiplying the QS permit owner's IBQ percent by the Shorebased IFQ Program component of the trawl bycatch mortality limit for that year. Deposits to QS accounts for Pacific halibut IBQ pounds will be made on or about January 1 each year. Mortality of any size Pacific halibut count against IBQ pounds.

      () In years where the Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is known by January _1_, deposits to QS accounts will be made on or about January 1.

      () In years where the Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is not known by January 1, NMFS will issue QP in two parts. On or about January 1, NMFS will deposit QP based on some portion of the International Pacific Halibut Commission's staff recommended total constant exploitation yield from their interim meeting. After the final Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is established from the International Pacific Halibut Commission's annual meeting, NMFS will deposit additional QP to the QS account.

      (D)  For the trawl fishery, NMFS will issue QP based on the following shorebased trawl allocations:

      (2) —(i)  Only the following persons are eligible to own QS permits:

      (A) A United States citizen, that is eligible to own and control a U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent citizenship requirement for entities);

      (B) A permanent resident alien, that is eligible to own and control a U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent citizenship requirement for entities); or

      (C) A corporation, partnership, or other entity established under the laws of the United States or any State, that is eligible to own and control a U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent citizenship requirement for entities). However, there is an exception for any entity that owns a mothership that participated in the west coast groundfish fishery during the allocation period and is eligible to own or control that U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to sections 203(g) and 213(g) of the AFA.

      (ii)  A QS account will be established by NMFS with the issuance of a QS permit. The administrative functions associated with the Shorebased IFQ Program (e.g., account registration, landing transactions, and transfers) are designed to be accomplished online; therefore, a participant must have access to a computer with Internet access and must set up online access to their QS account to participate. The computer must have Internet browser software installed (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla Firefox); as well as the Adobe Flash Player software version 9.0 or greater. NMFS will mail initial QS permit owners instructions to set up online access to their QS account. NMFS will use the QS account to send messages to QS permit owners; it is important for QS permit owners to monitor their online QS account and all associated messages.

      (iii)  NMFS will accept a QS permit application from January 1 to November 30 of each calendar year. QS permit applications received between December 1 and December 31 will be processed by NMFS in the following calendar year. NMFS will issue only one QS permit to each unique person, as defined at § 660.11 subject to the eligibility requirements at paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Each applicant must submit a complete application. A complete application includes a QS permit application form, payment of required fees, complete documentation of QS permit ownership on the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, and a complete economic data collection form as required under § 660.114. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The QS permit application will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted.

      (A)  For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if it disapproves the application. If approved, the QS permit serves as the IAD. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (B)  The QS permit is effective on the date given on the permit and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.

      (C)  If NMFS does not accept the QS permit application, the applicant may appeal the IAD consistent with the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g).

      (3) —(i)  (A) QS permits expire at the end of each calendar year, and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in order to remain in effect the following year. A complete QS permit renewal package must be received by NMFS no later than November 30 to be accepted by NMFS. A QS permit owner may submit a paper renewal package after January 1 of the following year as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section.

      (B) Notification to renew QS permits will be sent by SFD by September 15 each year to the QS permit owner's most recent email address in the SFD record. The QS permit owner shall provide SFD with notice of any email address change within 15 days of the change.

      (C) A complete QS permit renewal package must be received by November 30 of each calendar year. If a complete QS permit renewal package is not received by November 30, NMFS will not renew the QS permit, the associated QS account will not be activated in the following calendar year, and QS may not be transferred. NMFS will not issue QP or IBQ pounds associated with the non-renewed QS permit for that year. Any QP or IBQ pounds derived from the QS or IBQ in the inactive QS account will be distributed to the active QS accounts in proportion to the QS or IBQ for each IFQ species given on the renewed QS permit. If a QS permit is not renewed during the October 1 through November 30 renewal period, the QS permit owner may renew after January 1 in the following year by submission of a paper renewal application, or may renew the QS permit during the next October 1 through November 30 renewal period. For renewals submitted after January 1, QPs allocated as specified at paragraph (d)(1) of this section will not be allocated to the QS account in that year. The QS permit owner will be able to transfer QS percentages from the time the QS account is activated until November 30 of that calendar year.

      (D) QS permits will not be renewed until SFD has received a complete application for a QS permit renewal, which includes payment of required fees, complete documentation of QS permit ownership on the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, a complete economic data collection form as required under § 660.114. The QS permit renewal will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted.

      (E)  A QS permit is effective on the date given on the permit and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.

      (F)  QS permit renewals are subject to the permit appeals process specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (ii) —(A)  Ownership of a QS permit cannot be registered to another individual or entity. The QS permit owner cannot change or add additional individuals or entities as owners of the permit (, cannot change the legal name of the permit owner(s) as given on the permit). Any change in ownership of the QS permit requires the new owner(s) to apply for a QS permit, and is subject to accumulation limits and approval by NMFS.

      (B)  ()  Transfers of QS or IBQ from one QS account to another QS account and transfers of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel account must be accomplished via the online QS account. During the year there may be situations where NMFS deems it necessary to prohibit transfers (, account reconciliation, system maintenance, or for emergency fishery management reasons). To make a transfer, a QS permit owner must initiate a transfer request by logging onto the online QS account. Following the instructions provided on the Web site, the QS permit owner must enter pertinent information regarding the transfer request including, but not limited to: IFQ species, amount of QS, IBQ, QP, or IBQ pounds to be transferred for each IFQ species; name and any other identifier of the eligible transferee (e.g., QS permit number, vessel account number); and the value of the transferred QS, IBQ, QP, or IBQ pounds for each IFQ species. The online system will verify whether all information has been entered and whether the transfer complies with ownership limits or vessel limits, as applicable. If the information is not accepted, an electronic message will record as much in the transferor's QS account explaining the reason(s). If the information is accepted, the online system will record the pending transfer in both the transferor's QS account and the transferee's QS account or vessel account. The transferee must approve the transfer by electronic signature in order for the transfer to be completed. If the transferee accepts the transfer, the online system will record the transfer and confirm the transaction in both the transferor's QS account and the transferee's QS account or vessel account through a transaction confirmation notice. Once the transferee accepts the transaction, the transaction is final and permanent.

      ()  QS permit owners may transfer QS or IBQ to another owner of a QS permit, subject to accumulation limits and approval by NMFS. QS or IBQ is transferred as a percent, divisible to one-thousandth of a percent ( greater than or equal to 0.001 percent). QS or IBQ cannot be transferred to a vessel account. Owners of non-renewed QS permits may not transfer QS. QP in QS accounts cannot be transferred between QS accounts. NMFS will allocate QP based on the QS percentages as listed on a QS permit that was renewed during the previous October 1 through November 30 renewal period. QS transfers will be recorded in the QS account but will not become effective for purposes of allocating QPs until the following year. QS or IBQ may not be transferred between December 1 through December 31 each year. Any QS transaction that is pending as of December 1 will be administratively retracted. NMFS will allocate QP for the following year based on the QS percentages as of December 1 of each year.

      ()  QP or IBQ pounds must be transferred in whole pounds ( no fraction of a QP can be transferred). QP or IBQ pounds must be transferred to a vessel account in order to be used. Transfers of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel account are subject to annual vessel accumulation limits and NMFS' approval. Once QP or IBQ pounds are transferred from a QS account to a vessel account (accepted by the transferee/vessel owner), they cannot be transferred back to a QS account and may only be transferred to another vessel account. QP or IBQ pounds may not be transferred from one QS account to another QS account. All QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account must be transferred to one or more vessel accounts by December _3_1 each year in order to be fished. All QP or IBQ pounds expire at the end of the post-season transfer period of the year after which they were issued. If, in any year, the Regional Administrator makes a decision to reapportion Pacific whiting from the tribal to the non-tribal fishery or NMFS releases additional QP consistent with § 660.60(c) and paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, NMFS will credit QS accounts with additional QP proportionally, based on the QS percent for a particular QS permit owner and the increase in the shorebased trawl allocation specified at paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.

      (C) —() Transfer of QS or IBQ between QS accounts is effective on the date approved by NMFS.

      () Transfer of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel account is effective on the date approved by NMFS.

      (D)  Transfers are subject to the permit appeals process specified at § 660.25 (g), subpart C.

      (4) —(i)  QS and IBQ control limits are accumulation limits and are the amount of QS and IBQ that a person, individually or collectively, may own or control. QS and IBQ control limits are expressed as a percentage of the Shorebased IFQ Program's allocation.

      (A)  No person may own or control, or have a controlling influence over, by any means whatsoever an amount of QS or IBQ for any individual species that exceeds the Shorebased IFQ Program accumulation limits.

      (B)  To determine how much aggregate nonwhiting QS a person holds, NMFS will convert the person's QS to pounds. This conversion will always be conducted using the trawl allocations applied to the 2010 OYs, until such time as the Council recommends otherwise. Specifically, NMFS will multiply each person's QS for each species by the shoreside trawl allocation for that species. The person's pounds for all nonwhiting species will be summed and divided by the shoreside trawl allocation of all nonwhiting species to calculate the person's share of the aggregate nonwhiting trawl quota. To determine the shoreside trawl allocation for the purpose of determining compliance with the aggregate nonwhiting control limit, for species that have specific trawl allocation percentages in Amendment 21, NMFS will apply the Amendment 21 trawl allocation percentages to (set forth at § 660.55) the 2010 OYs, and where applicable, will deduct the preliminary set-asides for the at-sea sectors from Amendment 21. For species that do not have specific trawl allocation percentages in Amendment 21, NMFS will apply a percentage based on the Northwest Fishery Science Center final report on 2010 estimated total fishing mortality of groundfish by sector, or, if the final report for 2010 is not available, based on the most recent report available.

      (C) The Shorebased IFQ Program accumulation limits are as follows:

      (ii)  The QS or IBQ that counts toward a person's accumulation limit will include:

      (A) The QS or IBQ owned by that person, and

      (B) That portion of the QS or IBQ owned by an entity in which that person has an economic or financial interest, where the person's share of interest in that entity will determine the portion of that entity's QS or IBQ that counts toward the person's limit.

      (iii)  Control means, but is not limited to, the following:

      (A) The person has the right to direct, or does direct, in whole or in part, the business of the entity to which the QS or IBQ are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section;

      (B) The person has the right to limit the actions of or replace, or does limit the actions of or replace, the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, any general partner, or any person serving in a management capacity of the entity to which the QS or IBQ are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section;

      (C) The person, excluding banks and other financial institutions that rely on QS or IBQ as collateral for loans as described under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(G) of this section, has the right to direct, or does direct, and/or the right to prevent or delay, or does prevent or delay, the transfer of QS or IBQ, or the resulting QP or IBQ pounds;

      (D) The person, through loan covenants or any other means, has the right to restrict, or does restrict, and/or has a controlling influence over the day to day business activities or management policies of the entity to which the QS or IBQ are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section;

      (E) The person, has the right to restrict, or does restrict, any activity related to QS or IBQ or QP or IBQ pounds, including, but not limited to, use of QS or IBQ, or the resulting QP or IBQ pounds, or disposition of fish harvested under the resulting QP or IBQ pounds, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section;

      (F) The person has the right to control, or does control, the management of, or to be a controlling factor in, the entity to which the QS or IBQ, or the resulting QP or IBQ pounds, are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section;

      (G) The person, excluding banks and other financial institutions that rely on QS or IBQ as collateral for loans, has the right to cause or prevent, or does cause or prevent, the sale, lease or other disposition of QS or IBQ, or the resulting QP or IBQ pounds; and

      () To qualify for this exception, a bank or other financial institution must be regularly or primarily engaged in the business of lending and not engaged in or controlled by entities whose primary business is the harvesting, processing, or distribution of fish or fish products.

      () Any state or federally chartered bank or financial institution that meets the requirement of paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(G)() of this section does not need to submit additional information to NMFS.

      () Any entity that is not a state or federally chartered bank or financial institution, must submit a letter requesting the exception and disclose the identity and interest share of any shareholder with a 2% or more ownership interest in the lender through submission of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form (see paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section). The lender must make subsequent annual submissions of the letter and Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form to maintain the exception. Letters requesting the exception and complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Forms may be submitted to NMFS, West Coast Region, Permits Office, ATTN: Fisheries Permit Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115. NMFS will only accept complete applications.

      (H) The person has the ability through any means whatsoever to control or have a controlling influence over the entity to which QS or IBQ is registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (iv)  Any person that owns a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or renewing a QS permit shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the limited entry trawl or QS permit greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. For renewal, if the limited entry trawl permit and QS permit have identical ownership interest, only one form need be submitted attesting to such ownership. SFD will not issue a QS permit unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. Further, if SFD discovers through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a person owns or controls more than the accumulation limits and is not authorized to do so under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, the person will be notified and the QS permit will be issued up to the accumulation limit specified in the QS or IBQ control limit table from paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits.

      (v)  Accumulation limits will be calculated by first calculating the aggregate nonwhiting QS limit and then the individual species QS or IBQ control limits. For QS permit owners (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner named on the permit) that are found to exceed the accumulation limits during the reallocation of widow rockfish QS, an adjustment period will be provided during which they will have to completely divest their QS or IBQ in excess of the accumulation limits. If NMFS identifies that a QS permit owner exceeds the accumulation limits in 2016 or beyond, the QS permit owner must divest of the QS or IBQ in excess of the accumulation limits according to the procedure provided under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. Owners of QS or IBQ in excess of the control limits may receive and use the QP or IBQ pounds associated with that excess, up to the time their divestiture is completed.

      (A)  Any person owning or controlling QS or IBQ must comply with the accumulation limits, even if that control is not reflected in the ownership records available to NMFS as specified under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. If NMFS identifies that a QS permit owner exceeds an accumulation limit in 2016 or beyond for a reason other than the reallocation of widow rockfish, NMFS will notify the QS permit owner that he or she has 90 days to divest of the excess QS or IBQ. In the case that a QS permit owner exceeds the control limit for aggregate nonwhiting QS holdings, the QS permit owner may abandon QS to NMFS within 60 days of the notification by NMFS, using the procedure provided under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(C) of this section. After the 90-day divestiture period, NMFS will revoke all QS or IBQ held by a person (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner names on the permit) in excess of the accumulation limits following the procedures specified under paragraphs (d)(4)(v)(D) through (G) of this section. All abandoned or revoked shares will be redistributed to all other QS permit owners in proportion to their QS or IBQ holdings on or about January 1 of the following calendar year, based on current ownership records, except that no person will be allocated an amount of QS or IBQ that would put that person over an accumulation limit.

      (B)  Any person owning or controlling QS or IBQ must comply with the accumulation limits, even if that control is not reflected in the ownership records available to NMFS as specified under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. If the reallocation of widow rockfish puts any QS permit owner over an accumulation limit, the QS permit owner will have until November 30 of the year widow rockfish becomes transferrable to divest of their excess widow rockfish QS. In the case that a QS permit owner exceeds the control limit for aggregate nonwhiting QS holdings as the result of the reallocation of widow rockfish, the permit owner may abandon QS to NMFS by November 15 of the year widow rockfish becomes transferrable, using the procedure provided under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(C) of this section. NMFS will announce the QS transfer date for widow rockfish, the divestiture deadline, and the abandonment deadline after the widow reallocation IAD appeal deadline. After the widow rockfish reallocation divestiture period, NMFS will revoke all QS and IBQ held by a person (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner names on the permit) in excess of the accumulation limits following the procedures specified under paragraphs (d)(4)(v)(D) through (G) of this section. All abandoned or revoked shares will be redistributed to all other QS permit owners in proportion to their QS or IBQ holdings on or about January 1 of the following calendar year, based on current ownership records, except that no person will be allocated an amount of QS or IBQ that would put that person over an accumulation limit.

      (C)  QS permit owners that are over the control limit for aggregate nonwhiting QS holdings may voluntarily abandon QS if they notify NMFS in writing by the applicable deadline specified under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. The written abandonment request must include the following information: QS permit number, IFQ species, and the QS percentage to be abandoned. Either the QS permit owner or an authorized representative of the QS permit owner must sign the request. QS permit owners choosing to utilize the abandonment option will permanently relinquish to NMFS any right to the abandoned QS, and the QS will be redistributed as described under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. No compensation will be due for any abandoned shares.

      (D)  NMFS will revoke QS from any QS permit owner who exceeds an accumulation limit after the divestiture deadline specified under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. NMFS will follow the revocation approach summarized in the following table and explained under paragraphs (d)(4)(v)(E) through (G) of this section:

      (E)  In cases where a person has not divested to the control limits for individual species in one QS permit by the deadline specified under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section, NMFS will revoke excess QS at the species level in order to get that person to the limits. NMFS will redistribute the revoked QS following the process specified in paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. No compensation will be due for any revoked shares.

      (F)  In cases where a person has not divested to the control limits for individual species across QS permits by the deadline specified under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section, NMFS will revoke QS at the species level in proportion to the amount the QS percentage from each permit contributes to the total QS percentage owned. NMFS will redistribute the revoked QS following the process specified in paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. No compensation will be due for any revoked shares.

      (G)  In cases where a QS permit owner has not divested to the control limit for aggregate nonwhiting QS holdings by the deadline specified under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section, NMFS will revoke QS at the species level in proportion to the amount of the aggregate overage divided by the aggregate total owned. NMFS will redistribute the revoked QS following the process in paragraph (d)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. No compensation will be due for any revoked shares.

      (5)  An appeal to a QS permit or QS account action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process as defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (6)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of a QS permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (7) [Reserved]

      (8) —(i)  The following definitions are applicable to paragraph (d)(8) of this section and apply to terms used for the purposes of application requirements and initial issuance of QS permits and QS/IBQ:

      (A)  means a fishing trip where less than 50 percent by weight of all fish reported on the state landing receipt is whiting.

      (B)  means the Pacific Fisheries Information Network of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.

      (C)  means the landings history of a permit for a species, year, and area subdivision, divided by the total fleet history of the sector for that species, year, and area subdivision, as appropriate, or, in the case of shoreside processors, the annual sum of the shoreside processor's whiting receipts divided by the aggregate annual sum of whiting received by all shoreside processors in that year. _Relative history_ is expressed as a percent.

      (D)  means an operation, working on U.S. soil, that takes delivery of trawl caught groundfish that has not been processed; and that thereafter engages that fish in shoreside processing. Entities that received fish that have not undergone at-sea processing or shoreside processing and sell that fish directly to consumers shall not be considered a processor for purposes of QS allocations. Shoreside processing is defined as either of the following:

      () Any activity that takes place shoreside; and that involves: Cutting groundfish into smaller portions; or freezing, cooking, smoking, drying groundfish; or packaging that groundfish for resale into _1_00 pound units or smaller for sale or distribution into a wholesale or retail market.

      () The purchase and redistribution in to a wholesale or retail market of live groundfish from a harvesting vessel.

      (E)  means a fishing trip where greater than or equal to 50 percent by weight of all fish reported on the state landing receipt is whiting.

      (ii)  Only the following persons are eligible to receive a QS permit or QS/IBQ:

      (A) The owner of a valid trawl limited entry permit is eligible to receive a QS permit and its associated QS or IBQ amount. Any past landings history associated with the current limited entry trawl permit accrues to the current permit owner. NMFS will not recognize any person as the limited entry permit owner other than the person listed as limited entry permit owner in NMFS permit database. If a limited entry permit has history on state landing receipts and has been combined with a permit that has received or will receive a C/P endorsement, the trawl limited entry permit does not qualify for QS or IBQ.

      (B) Shoreside processors that meet the recent participation requirement of having received deliveries of 1 mt or more of whiting from whiting trips in each of any two years from 1998 through 2004 are eligible for an initial issuance of whiting QS. NMFS will initially identify shoreside processors by reference to Pacific whiting shoreside first receivers recorded on fish tickets in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010, subject to correction as described in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(G) of this section.

      (iii)  The QS and IBQ allocation formulas are applied in the following steps:

      (A) First, for each limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will determine a preliminary QS allocation for non-whiting trips.

      (B) Second, for each limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will determine a preliminary QS allocation for whiting trips.

      (C) Third, for each limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will combine the amounts resulting from paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.

      (D) Fourth, NMFS will reduce the results for limited entry trawl permit owners by 10 percent of non-whiting species as a set aside for Adaptive Management Program (AMP) and by 20 percent of whiting for the initial issuance of QS allocated to qualifying shoreside processors.

      (E) Fifth, NMFS will determine the whiting QS allocation for qualifying shoreside processors from the 20 percent of whiting QS allocated to qualifying shoreside processors at initial issuance of QS.

      (F) Sixth, for each limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will determine the Pacific halibut IBQ allocation.

      (G) Seventh, for limited entry trawl permits transferred after November 8, 2008, or if transferred earlier, not registered with NMFS by November 30, 2008, for which NMFS determines the owners of such permits would exceed the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (d)(4) of this section based on the previous steps, NMFS will redistribute the excess QS or IBQ to other qualified QS permit owners within the accumulation limits.

      (iv) —(A)  Unless otherwise specified, the following rules will be applied to data for the purpose of calculating an initial allocation of QS and IBQ:

      () For limited entry trawl permit owners, a permit will be assigned catch history or relative history based on the landing history of the vessel(s) associated with the permit at the time the landings were made.

      () The relevant PacFIN dataset includes species compositions based on port sampled data and applied to data at the vessel level.

      () Only landings of IFQ species which are caught in the exclusive economic zone or adjacent state waters off Washington, Oregon and California will be used for calculation of allocation formulas. For the purpose of allocation of IFQ species for which the QS or IBQ will be subdivided by area, catch areas have been assigned to landings of IFQ species reported on state landing receipts based on port of landing.

      () History from limited entry permits that have been combined with a permit that may qualify for a C/P endorsement and which has shorebased permit history will not be included in the preliminary QS and IBQ allocation formula, other than in the determination of fleet history used in the calculation of relative history for permits that do not have a C/P endorsement.

      () History of illegal landings and landings made under non-whiting EFPs that are in excess of the cumulative limits in place for the non-EFP fishery will not count toward the allocation of QS or IBQ.

      () The limited entry permit's landings history includes the landings history of permits that have been previously combined with that permit.

      () If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will split the landing history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.

      () Unless otherwise noted, the calculation for QS or IBQ allocation under paragraph (d)(_8_) of this section will be based on state landing receipts (fish tickets) as recorded in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010.

      () For limited entry trawl permits, landings under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not count toward the allocation of QS or IBQ, other than in the determination of fleet history used in the calculation of relative history for permits that do not have a C/P endorsement.

      () For limited entry trawl permits, NMFS will calculate initial issuance of QS separately based on whiting trips and non-whiting trips, and will weigh each calculation according to initial issuance allocations between whiting trips and non-whiting trips, which are one-time allocations necessary for the formulas used during the initial issuance of QS to create a single Shorebased IFQ Program. The initial issuance allocations between whiting and non-whiting trips for canary rockfish, bocaccio, cowcod, yelloweye rockfish, minor shelf rockfish N. of 40°_10_′, minor shelf rockfish S. of 40°10′, and minor slope rockfish S. of 40°10′ will be determined through the biennial specifications process. The initial issuance allocations for the remaining IFQ species are as follows:

      (B)  NMFS will calculate the non-whiting preliminary QS allocation differently for different species groups, Groups 1 through 3.

      ()  For the purposes of preliminary QS allocation, IFQ species will be grouped as follows:

      () Group 1 _i_ncludes lingcod, Pacific cod, Pacific whiting, sablefish north of 36° N. lat., sablefish south of 36° N. lat., Dover sole, English sole, petrale sole, arrowtooth flounder, starry flounder, other flatfish stock complex, chilipepper rockfish, splitnose rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, shortspine thornyhead north of 34°27′ N. lat., shortspine thornyhead south of 34°27′ N. lat., longspine thornyhead north of 34°27′ N. lat., minor rockfish north slope species complex, minor rockfish south slope species complex, minor rockfish north shelf species complex, and minor rockfish south shelf species complex.

      () Group 2 includes bocaccio, cowcod, darkblotched rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, widow rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish.

      () Group 3 includes canary rockfish.

      ()  The preliminary QS allocation process indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section for Group 1 species follows a two-step process, one to allocate a pool of QS equally among all eligible limited entry permits and the other to allocate the remainder of the preliminary QS based on permit history. Through these two processes, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent for each Group 1 species will be allocated. In later steps this amount will be adjusted and reduced as indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(C) and (D), to determine the QS allocation.

      ()  The pool of QS for equal allocat_i_on will be determined using the landings history from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program ( buyback permit) (70 FR 45695, August 8, 2005). The QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be the buyback permit history as a percent of the total fleet history for the allocation period. The calculation will be based on total absolute pounds with no dropped years and no other adjustments. The QS pool will be divided equally among qualifying limited entry permits for all QS species/species groups and areas in Group 1.

      ()  The pool for QS allocation based on limited entry trawl permit history will be the QS remaining after subtracting out the QS allocated equally. This pool will be allocated to each qualifying limited entry trawl permit based on the permit's relative history from 1994 through 2003. For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate a set of relative histories using the following methodology. First, NMFS will sum the permit's landings by each year for each Group 1 species/species group and area subdivision. Second, NMFS will divide each permit's annual sum for a particular species/species group and area subdivision by the shoreside limited entry trawl fleet's annual sum for the same species/species group and area subdivision. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each permit by species/species group and area subdivision by adding all relative histories for the permit together and subtracting the three years with the lowest relative history for the permit. The result for each permit by species/species group and areas subdivision will be divided by the aggregate sum of all total relative histories of all qualifying limited entry trawl permits for that species/species group and area subdivision. NMFS will then multiply the result from this calculation by the amount of QS in the pool to be allocated based on each permit's history.

      ()  The preliminary QS allocation step indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(_iii_)(A) of this section will be calculated for each limited entry trawl permit using a formula based on QS allocations for each limited entry trawl permit for 11 target species, areas of distribution of fishing effort as determined from 200____3____-2006 target species catch data from the PacFIN Coastwide Trawl Logbook Database, average bycatch ratios for each area as derived from West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data from 2003 through 2006, and the non-whiting initial issuance allocation of the limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for each of the 11 target species. These data are used in a series of sequential steps to estimate the allocation of Group 2 species to each limited entry trawl permit. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() to () of this section estimate the permit's total 2003-2006 target species by area. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() to () of this section project Group 2 species bycatch amounts using 2003-2006 WCGOP observer ratios and the initial issuance allocation applied to the 2011 limited entry trawl allocation. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() to () of this section convert these amounts into QS. As with Group 1 species, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent for each Group 2 species unit will be allocated and the amount of the allocations will be adjusted and reduced as indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(C) and (D) of this section to determine the QS allocation.

      () The 11 target spec_i_es are arrowtooth flounder, starry flounder, other flatfish, Dover sole, English sole, petrale sole, minor slope rockfish, shortspine thornyheads, longspine thornyheads, sablefish, and Pacific cod.

      () The 8 areas of distribution of fishing effort are defined latitudinally and by depth. The latitudinal areas are (a) north of 47°40 N. lat.; (b) between 47°40 N. lat. and 43°55′ N. lat.; (c) 43°55′ N. lat. and 40°10′ N. lat.; and (d) south of 40°10′ N. lat. Each latitudinal area is further divided by depth into areas shoreward and seaward of the trawl Rockfish Conservation Area as defined at § 660.130(e)(4) of this subpart.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will review the permit logbook data for that permit and sum target species catch recorded for the years 2003-2006, resulting in total target species catch in each area for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006 for all 11 target species in aggregate.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will also sum target species catch by area into total coastwide target species catch for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006 for all 11 target species in aggregate. For practicability, seaward or shoreward of the RCA as identified in the logbook data is defined as being deeper than or shallower than 115 fathoms, respect_iv_ely.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will di_v_ide logbook aggregate target species catch in each area (paragraph (d)(8)(_iv_)(B)()() of this section) by the permit's total coastwide target species catch (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section) to create a set of 8 area catch ratios for each permit. (Note: The sum of all area catch ratios equals 1 for each permit).

      () For limited entry trawl permits where the vessel registered to the permit did not submit logbooks showing any catch of the 11 target species for any of the years 200__3__ through 2006, NMFS will use the following formula to calculate area target catch ratios: (a) NMFS will sum by area all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook area target catches from paragraph (d)(8)(_iv_)(B)()() of this section, (b) NMFS will sum coastwide all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook target catches across all areas from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section, and (c) NMFS will di_vi_de these sums (, a/b) to create average permit logbook area target catch ratios.

      () NMFS will calculate the 2011 non-whiting short term allocation amount for each of the 11 target species by multiplying the limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for each by the corresponding initial issuance allocation percentage for the non-whiting sector given in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A)() of this section or determined through the biennial specifications process, as applicable.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will obtain the percentage of the limited entry trawl permit initial QS allocation for each of the 11 target species resulting from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)() of this section.

      () NMFS will calculate each limited entry trawl permit's projected non-whiting sector quota pounds for 2011 by multiplying the 2011 non-whiting sector initial issuance allocation amounts for each of the 11 target species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section by each permit's target species QS allocation percentage from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will sum the projected quota pounds for the 11 target species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section to get a total projected weight of all 11 target species for the limited entry trawl permit.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will estimate the permit's total incidental catch of Group 2 species by area by multiplying the projected 2011 total weight of all 11 target species by the applicable area catch ratio for each area as calculated in either paragraph (d)(8)(i_v_)(B)()() of this section (permits with logbook data) or paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section (permits without logbook data).

      () NMFS will apply WCGOP average bycatch ratios for each Group 2 species (observed Group 2 species catch/total target species catch) by area. The WCGOP average bycatch ratios are as follows:

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate projected Group 2 species amounts by area by multiplying the limited entry trawl permit's projected 2011 total weight of all target species by area from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section by the applicable average bycatch ratio for each Group 2 species and corresponding area of paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will sum all area amounts for each Group 2 species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section to calculate the total projected amounts of each Group 2 species for each limited entry trawl permit.

      () NMFS will sum all limited entry trawl permits' projected Group 2 species amounts from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section to calculate coastwide total projected amounts for each Group 2 species.

      () NMFS will estimate preliminary QS for each limited entry trawl permit for each Group 2 species by dividing each limited entry trawl permit's total projected amount of each Group 2 species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section by the coastwide total projected amount for that species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section.

      ()  () The prel__i__minary QS allocation step indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section will be performed in two calculations that result in the division of preliminary QS allocation into two pools, one to allocate QS equally among all eligible limited entry permits, using the approach identified for Group 1 species in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section, and the other to allocate QS using a formula based on QS allocations for target species and areas fished, using the approach identified for Group _2_ species in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)() of this section, using the following WCGOP average bycatch rates:

      () Through these two processes, prel_i_minary QS totaling 100 percent for each species will be allocated. In later steps, this amount will be adjusted and reduced as indicated in paragraphs (d)(8)(__ii__i)(C) and (D) of this section to determine the QS allocation. In combining the two QS pools for each permit, the equal allocation portion is weighted according to the process in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section, and the portion calculated based on allocations for target species and areas fished is weighted according to the process in (d)(8)(iv)(B)()() of this section.

      (C)  The preliminary QS allocation based on whiting trips as indicated in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(B) of this section for limited entry trawl permits follows a two step process, one to allocate a pool of QS equally among all eligible limited entry permits and the other to allocate the remainder of the preliminary QS based on permit history. Through these two processes, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent for each species will be allocated. In later steps, this amount will be adjusted and reduced, as indicated in paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(C) and (D) of this section, to determine the QS allocation.

      ()  The pool of QS for equal allocation will be determined using the whiting trip landings history from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program ( buyback permit) (70 FR 45695, August 8, 2005). For each species, the whiting trip QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be the buyback permit history as a percent of the total fleet history for the allocation period. The calculation will be based on total absolute pounds with no dropped years and no other adjustments. The whiting trip QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be divided equally among all qualifying limited entry permits for each species.

      ()  The pool for QS allocation based on each limited entry trawl permit's history will be the QS remaining after subtracting out the QS associated with the buyback permits allocated equally.

      ()  Wh_i_ting QS based on each limited entry trawl permit's history will be allocated based on the permit's relative history from 1994 through 2003. For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate a whiting relative history for each qualifying year, as follows. First, NMFS will sum the permit's history of landings of whiting from whiting trips for each year. Second, NMFS will divide each permit's annual sum of whiting from whiting trips by the shoreside limited entry trawl fleet's annual sum of whiting. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each permit by adding all relative histories for the permit together and subtracting the two years with the lowest relative history. NMFS will then divide the result for each permit by the total relative history for whiting of all qualifying limited entry trawl permits. The result from this calculation will then be multiplied by the amount of whiting QS in the pool to be allocated based on each permit's history.

      ()  Other incidentally caught species from the QS remaining after subtracting out the QS associated with the buyback permits will be allocated pro-rata based on each limited entry trawl permit's whiting QS from whiting trips. Pro-rata means a percent that is equal to the percent of whiting QS.

      (D)  NMFS will calculate the portion of QS for each species which a permit receives based on non-whiting trips and whiting trips separately and will weight each preliminary QS in proportion to the initial issuance allocation percentage between whiting trips and non-whiting trips for that species in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(A)() of this section or determined through the biennial specifications process, as applicable.

      ()  To determine the amount of QS of each species for non-whiting trips for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the preliminary QS for the permit from paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section for each species by the initial issuance allocation percentage for that species for non-whiting trips.

      ()  To determine the amount of QS of each species for whiting trips for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the preliminary QS from paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(B) of this section for each species by the initial issuance allocation percentage for that species for whiting trips.

      (E)  For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will add the results for the permit from paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(D)() and (D)() of this section in order to determine the total QS for each species on that permit.

      (F)  NMFS will reduce the non-whiting QS allocation to each limited entry trawl permit by 10 percent, for a QS set-aside to AMP. NMFS will reduce the whiting QS allocation to each limited entry trawl permit by 20 percent for the initial QS allocation to shoreside processors.

      (G)  NMFS will calculate the amount of whiting QS available to shoreside processors from the 20 percent adjustment of whiting QS allocations in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(F) of this section. For each eligible shoreside processor, whiting QS will be allocated based on the eligible shoreside processor's relative history from 1998 through 2004. Only the deliveries for which the shoreside processor is the first processor of the fish will be used in the calculation of whiting relative history.

      () For each shoreside processor which has received deliveries of at least _1_ mt of whiting from whiting trips in each of any two years from 1998 through 2004, NMFS will calculate a whiting relative history for each qualifying year, as follows. First, NMFS will sum the shoreside processor's receipts of whiting for each year. Second, NMFS will calculate the relative history for each year by dividing each shoreside processor's annual sum of whiting receipts by the aggregate annual sum of whiting received by all shoreside processors in that year. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each shoreside processor by adding all relative histories for the shoreside processor together and subtracting the two years with the lowest relative history. NMFS will then divide the result for each shoreside processor by the aggregate sum of all total relative histories for whiting by all qualifying shoreside processors. The result from this calculation will then be multiplied by 20 percent to determine the shoreside processor's whiting QS.

      () For purposes of making an initial issuance of whiting QS to a shoreside processor, NMFS will attribute landing history to the Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver reported on the landing receipt (the entity responsible for filling out the state landing receipt) as recorded in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, _2_010. History may be reassigned to a shoreside processor not on the state landings receipt as described at paragraph (d)(8)(vi)(B) of this section.

      (H)  For each eligible limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will calculate Pacific halibut individual bycatch quota (IBQ) for the area north of 40°10′ N. lat. using a formula based on (a) QS allocations for each limited entry trawl permit for two target species, (b) areas of distribution of fishing effort as determined from 200_3_-200_6_ target species catch data from the PacFIN Coastwide Trawl Logbook Database, (c) average bycatch ratios for each area as derived from WCGOP data from 2003 through 2006, and (d) the non-whiting initial issuance allocation of the limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for arrowtooth and petrale sole. These data are used in a series of sequential steps to determine the allocation of IBQ to each limited entry trawl permit. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section estimate the permit's total 2003-2006 target species by area. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section project Pacific halibut bycatch amounts using 2003-2006 WCGOP observer ratios and the 2011 non-whiting initial issuance allocation of the limited entry trawl allocation amounts. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section convert these amounts into QS.

      () The target species are arrowtooth flounder and petrale sole.

      () The four bycatch areas are defined latitudinally and by depth. The latitudinal areas are (a) north of 47°30′ N. lat., and (b) between 40°10′ N. lat. and 47°30′ N. lat. Each latitudinal area is further divided by depth into areas shoreward and seaward of the trawl Rockfish Conservation Area as defined at § 660.130(e)(4), subpart D.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will review the permit logbook data for that permit and sum target species catch recorded for the years 200_3_-2006, resulting in total target species catch in each of the four areas for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006 for both target species in aggregate. For practicability, seaward or shoreward of the RCA as identified in the logbook data is defined as being deeper than or shallower than 115 fathoms, respectively.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will also sum the target species catch by area into total aggregate target species catch for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will divide logbook aggregate target species catch in each area (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section) by the sum of the permit's catch of each target species in all four bycatch areas (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section) to create a set of area catch ratios for each permit. (Note: The sum of all four area catch ratios in aggregate equals 1 for each permit).

      () For limited entry trawl permits where the vessel registered to the permit did not submit logbooks showing any catch of either of the two target species for any of the years 200_3_ through 200_6_, NMFS will use the following formula to calculate area target catch ratios: NMFS will sum by area all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook area target catches from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section, and sum all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook target catches across all four areas from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section; and divide these sums to create average permit logbook area target catch ratios.

      () NMFS will calculate the 2011 non-whiting initial issuance allocation amount for each of the two target species by multiplying the limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for each by the corresponding initial issuance allocation percentage for the non-whiting sector given in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(A)() of this section.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will obtain the non-whiting portion of each limited entry trawl permit's initial QS allocations for each of the two target species resulting from paragraph (d)(_8_)(iv)(B)() of this section.

      () NMFS will calculate each limited entry trawl permit's projected non-whiting sector quota pounds for the two target species for 2011 by multiplying the 2011 non-whiting sector short term allocation amounts for each of the target species by the permit's QS allocation percentage for the species from paragraph (d)(_8_)(iv)(H)() of this section.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will sum the projected quota pounds for the two target species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section to get a total projected weight of the two target species for the limited entry trawl permit.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the projected 20_11_ total weight of the two target species by the applicable area catch ratio for each area as calculated in either paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section (permits with logbook data) or paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section (permits without logbook data).

      () NMFS will apply WCGOP average halibut bycatch ratios (observed halibut catch/total of two target species catch) by area. The WCGOP average halibut bycatch ratios are as follows:

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate projected Pacific halibut amounts by area by multiplying the limited entry trawl permit's projected 20_11_ total weight of the two target species by area from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section by the average bycatch ratio for the corresponding area of paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section.

      () For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will sum all area amounts from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section to calculate the total projected Pacific halibut amount for each limited entry trawl permit.

      () NMFS will sum all limited entry trawl permits' projected Pacific halibut amounts from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section to calculate aggregate total amounts of Pacific halibut.

      () NMFS will estimate preliminary Pacific halibut IBQ for each limited entry trawl permit by dividing each limited entry trawl permit's total projected Pacific halibut amount from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section by the aggregate total amounts of Pacific halibut from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section.

      (I)  For each limited entry trawl permit transferred after November 8, 2008, or if transferred earlier, not registered with NMFS by November 30, 2008, for which NMFS determines that the owner of such permit would exceed the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section based on calculation of the preceding allocation formulas for all limited entry trawl permits owned by such owner using the individual and collective rule described at § 660.140(d)(4)(ii), NMFS will redistribute the excess QS or IBQ to other qualified QS permit owners within the accumulation limits.

      (v)  Persons may apply for an initial issuance of QS and IBQ and a QS permit in one of two ways: Complete and submit a prequalified application received from NMFS, or complete and submit an application package. The completed application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive consideration for initial issuance of QS and IBQ and a QS permit.

      (A)  A “prequalified application” is a partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined the landings history that may qualify the applicant for an initial issuance of QS and IBQ. The application package will include a prequalified application (with landings history), a Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest form, and any other documents NMFS believes are necessary to aid the limited entry permit owner in completing the QS application.

      () For current trawl limited entry permit owners, NMFS will mail a prequalified application to all owners, as listed in the NMFS permit database at the time applications are mailed, that NMFS determines may qualify for QS or IBQ. NMFS will mail the application by certified mail to the current address of record in the NMFS permit database. The application will contain the basis of NMFS' calculation of the permit owner's QS and IBQ for each species/species group or area.

      () For shoreside processors, NMFS will mail a prequalified application to those Pacific whiting shoreside first receivers with receipts of 1 mt or more of whiting from whiting trips in each of any two years from 1998 through _2_004, as documented on fish tickets in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010. NMFS will mail the prequalified application by certified mail to the current address of record given by the state in which the entity is registered. For all qualified entities who meet the eligibility requirement at paragraph (d)(8)(ii)(B) of this section, the application will provide the basis of NMFS' calculation of the initial issuance of Pacific whiting QS.

      (B)  An owner of a current limited entry trawl permit or a Pacific whiting first receiver or shoreside processor that believes it is qualified for an initial issuance of QS and IBQ and does not receive a prequalified application, must complete an application package and submit the completed application to NMFS by the application deadline. Application packages are available on NMFS' Web site () or by contacting SFD. An application must include valid PacFIN data or other credible information that substantiates the applicant's qualification for an initial issuance of QS and IBQ.

      (vi)  If an applicant does not accept NMFS' calculation in the prequalified application either in part or whole, the applicant must identify in writing to NMFS which parts the applicant believes to be inaccurate, and must provide specific credible information to substantiate any requested corrections. The completed application and specific credible information must be provided to NMFS in writing by the application deadline. Written communication must either be post-marked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. Requests for corrections may only be granted for the following reasons:

      (A) Errors in NMFS' use or application of data, including:

      () Errors in NMFS' use or application of landings data from PacFIN;

      () Errors in NMFS' use or application of state logbook data from PacFIN;

      () Errors in NMFS' application of the QS or IBQ allocation formula;

      () Errors in identification of the permit owner, permit combinations, or vessel registration as listed in NMFS permit database;

      () Errors in identification of ownership information for the first receiver or the processor that first processed the fish; and

      () Errors in NMFS' use or application of ownership interest information.

      (B)  For shoreside processors, the landing history may be reassigned from the Pacific whiting shoreside first receive identified in the relevant PacFIN database to a shoreside processor that was in fact the first processor of the fish. In order for an applicant to request that landing history be reassigned, an authorized representative for the Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver identified on the state landing receipt must submit, by the application deadline date specified in paragraph (d)(8)(vii)(B) of this section for initial issuance of QS, a written request that the whiting landings history from the qualifying years be conveyed to a shoreside processor. The letter must be signed and dated by the authorized representative of the Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver named on the state landing receipt and signed and dated by the authorized representative of the shoreside processor to which the Pacific whiting landing history is requested to be reassigned. The letter must identify the dates of the landings history and the associated amounts that are requested to be reassigned, and include the legal name of the shoreside processor to which the Pacific whiting landing history is requested to be reassigned, their date of birth or tax identification number, business address, business phone number, fax number, and e-mail address. If any document exists that demonstrates that the shoreside processor to which the Pacific whiting landing history is requested to be reassigned was in fact the first processor of the fish, such documentation must be provided to NMFS. NMFS will review the information submitted and will make a determination as part of the IAD.

      (vii) —(A)  Submission of the complete, certified application includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      () The applicant is required to sign and date the application and have the document notarized by a licensed Notary Public.

      () The applicant must certify that they qualify to own QS and IBQ.

      () The applicant must indicate they accept NMFS' calculation of initial issuance of QS and IBQ provided in the prequalified application, or provide credible information that demonstrates their qualification for QS and IBQ.

      () The applicant is required to provide a complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as specified at paragraph (d)(_4_)(iv) of this section.

      () Business entities may be required to submit a corporate resolution or other credible documentation as proof that the representative of the entity is authorized to act on behalf of the entity; and

      () NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to make an IAD on initial issuance of QS or IBQ.

      (B)  A complete, certified application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours to NMFS West Coast Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE., Seattle, WA 98115, no later than November 1, 2010. NMFS will not accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the application deadline. There are no hardship exemptions for this deadline.

      (viii)  NMFS will not review or approve any request for a change in limited entry trawl permit owner at any time after either November 1, 2010 or the date upon which the application is received by NMFS, whichever occurs first, until a final decision is made by the Regional Administrator on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce regarding the QS and IBQ to be issued for that permit.

      (ix)  NMFS will issue an IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for initial issuance of QS and IBQ, the applicant will receive a QS permit specifying the amounts of QS and IBQ for which the applicant has qualified and the applicant will be registered to a QS account. If NMFS disapproves or partially disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons. As part of the IAD, NMFS will indicate whether the QS permit owner qualifies for QS or IBQ in amounts that exceed the accumulation limits and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, or whether the QS permit owner qualifies for QS or IBQ that exceed the accumulation limits and does not qualify to receive the excess under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (x)  For QS permits and QS/IBQ issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C. For the initial issuance of QS/IBQ and the QS permits, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (d)(8)(vi) of this section. An additional basis for appeal for whiting QS based on shoreside processing is an allegation that the shoreside processor or Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver to which a QS permit and whiting QS have been assigned was not in fact the first processor of the fish included in the qualifying landings history. The appellant must submit credible information supporting the allegation that they were in fact the first shoreside processor for the fish in question. Items not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of permit landings data or Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver landings data in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010.

      (9) —(i)  The following definitions are applicable to paragraph (d)(9) of this section and apply only to terms used for the purposes of reallocation of widow rockfish QS:

      (A)  means a fishing trip where less than 50 percent by weight of all fish reported on the state landing receipt is whiting.

      (B)  means the Pacific Fisheries Information Network of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.

      (C)  means the landings history of a limited entry trawl permit for a species, year, and area subdivision, divided by the total fleet history of the sector for that species, year, and area subdivision, as appropriate.

      (D)  means a fishing trip where greater than or equal to 50 percent by weight of all fish reported on the state landing receipt is whiting.

      (ii)  Only the owner of an original QS permit (non-shoreside processor) to which QS was initially allocated in 2011 is eligible to receive reallocated widow rockfish QS based on the history of the limited entry trawl permit(s) that accrued to that QS permit, regardless of current limited entry permit ownership. For those new QS permits to which widow rockfish was administratively transferred by NMFS under U.S. court order, NMFS will reallocate widow rockfish QS directly to the new QS permit. Any limited entry trawl permit owners who did not submit an initial application for a QS permit will not be eligible to receive reallocated widow rockfish QS.

      (iii)  The widow rockfish QS reallocation formula is applied in the following steps:

      (A) First, for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will determine a preliminary QS allocation for nonwhiting trips.

      (B) Second, for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will determine a preliminary QS allocation for whiting trips.

      (C) Third, for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will combine the amounts resulting from paragraphs (d)(9)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.

      (D) Fourth, NMFS will reduce the total widow rockfish QS reallocated to QS permit owners by 10 percent as a set aside for AMP.

      (iv) —(A)  The following rules will be applied to data for the purpose of calculating the initial reallocation of widow rockfish QS:

      () Limited entry trawl permits will be assigned catch history or relative history based on the landing history of the vessel(s) associated with the permit at the time the landings were made.

      () The relevant PacFIN dataset includes species compositions based on port sampled data and applied to data at the vessel level.

      () Only landings of widow rockfish that were caught in the exclusive economic zone or adjacent state waters off Washington, Oregon, and California will be used for calculating the reallocation of widow rockfish QS.

      () History from limited entry trawl permits that have been combined with a limited entry trawl permit that qualified for a C/P endorsement and which has shorebased permit history will not be included in the preliminary QS and IBQ allocation formula, other than in the determination of fleet history used in the calculation of relative history for limited entry trawl permits that do not have a C/P endorsement.

      () History of illegal landings and landings made under nonwhiting EFPs that are in excess of the cumulative limits in place for the non-EFP fishery will not count toward the allocation of QS.

      () The limited entry trawl permit's landings history includes the landings history of limited entry trawl permits that have been previously combined with that limited entry trawl permit.

      () If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will split the landing history evenly between all such limited entry trawl permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.

      () Unless otherwise noted, the calculation for the reallocation of widow rockfish QS under paragraph (d)(9) will be based on state landing receipts (fish tickets) as recorded in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 27, 2016.

      () For limited entry trawl permits, landings under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not count toward the reallocation of widow rockfish QS, other than in the determination of fleet history used in the calculation of relative history for permits that do not have a C/P endorsement.

      () For limited entry trawl permits, NMFS will calculate the reallocation of widow rockfish QS separately based on whiting trips and nonwhiting trips, and will weigh each calculation according to a split between whiting trips and nonwhiting trips of _10_.833 percent for whiting trips and 89.167 percent for nonwhiting trips, which is a one-time proportion necessary for the reallocation formula.

      (B)  The preliminary reallocation process in paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(A) of this section follows a two-step process, one to allocate a pool of QS equally among all eligible limited entry permits and the other to allocate the remainder of the preliminary QS based on limited entry trawl permit history. Through these two processes, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent will be allocated. In later steps, this will be adjusted and reduced as indicated in paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(C) and (D) to determine the QS allocation.

      ()  The pool of QS for equal allocation will be determined using the nonwhiting trip landings history from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program ( buyback program) (68 FR 426_1_3, July 18, 2003). The nonwhiting trip QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be the buyback permit history as a percent of the total fleet history for the 1994 to 2003 nonwhiting trip reallocation period. The calculation will be based on total absolute pounds with no dropped years and no other adjustments. The QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be divided equally among all qualifying limited entry permits.

      ()  The pool of QS for allocation based on limited entry trawl permit nonwhiting trip history will be the QS remaining after subtracting out the QS allocated equally. This pool will be allocated to each qualifying limited entry trawl permit based on the permit's relative nonwhiting trip history from 1994 through _2_002, dropping the three lowest years. For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate relative history using the following methodology. First, NMFS will sum the permit's widow rockfish landings on nonwhiting trips for each year in the reallocation period. Second, NMFS will divide each permit's annual sum by the shoreside limited entry trawl fleet's annual sum. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each permit by adding all relative histories for the permit together and subtracting the three years with the lowest relative history for the permit. The result for each permit will be divided by the aggregate sum of all total relative histories of all qualifying limited entry trawl permits. NMFS will then multiply the result from this calculation by the amount of QS in the pool to be allocated based on each permit's history.

      (C)  The preliminary reallocation process in paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(B) of this section follows a two-step process, one to allocate a pool of QS equally among all eligible limited entry permits and the other to allocate the remainder of the preliminary QS based on permit history. Through these two processes, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent will be allocated. In later steps, this will be adjusted and reduced as indicated in paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(C) and (D) to determine the QS allocation.

      ()  The pool of QS for equal allocation will be determined using whiting trip landings history from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program ( buyback program) (68 FR 426_1_3, July 18, 2003). The whiting trip QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be the buyback permit history as a percent of the total fleet history for the 1994 to 2003 whiting trip reallocation period. The calculation will be based on total absolute pounds with no dropped years and no other adjustments. The QS pool associated with the buyback permits will be divided equally among all qualifying limited entry permits.

      ()  The pool of QS for allocation based on each limited entry trawl permit's whiting trip history will be the QS remaining after subtracting out the QS allocated equally. Widow rockfish QS for this pool will be allocated pro-rata based on each limited entry trawl permit's whiting QS from whiting trips that was established in _2_010 and used to allocate the whiting trip portion of whiting QS at the time of initial implementation in 2011. Pro-rata means a percent that is equal to the percent of whiting QS from whiting trips.

      (D)  NMFS will calculate the portion of widow QS a limited entry trawl permit receives based on nonwhiting trips and whiting trips separately, and will weight each preliminary QS in proportion to the one-time reallocation percentage between whiting trips and nonwhiting trips of 10.833 percent and 89.167 percent, respectively.

      ()  To determine the amount of widow QS for nonwhiting trips for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the preliminary QS for the permit from paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(A) of this section by the one-time reallocation percentage of 89._1_67 percent for nonwhiting trips.

      ()  To determine the amount of widow QS for whiting trips for each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the preliminary QS for the permit from paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(B) of this section by the one-time reallocation percentage of 10.833 percent for whiting trips.

      (E)  For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will add the results for the permit from paragraphs (d)(9)(iv)(D)() and (D)() of this section in order to determine the total QS widow for that permit.

      (F)  NMFS will reduce the widow QS reallocated to each permit owner by a proportional amount that is equivalent to a reduction of 10 percent across all widow reallocation recipients' holdings as a set aside for AMP.

      (v)  Persons may apply for issuance of reallocated widow rockfish QS by completing and submitting a prequalified application. A “prequalified application” is a partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined the landings history for each limited entry trawl permit that qualifies the applicant for a reallocation of widow QS. The application package will include a prequalified application with landings history. The completed application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered to NMFS within normal business hours no later than December 26, 2017. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive reallocated widow rockfish QS and their percentage will be redistributed to other QS permit owners who submitted complete widow rockfish reallocation applications in proportion to their reallocated widow QS amount.

      (vi)  If an applicant does not accept NMFS's calculation in the prequalified application either in part or whole, the applicant must identify in writing to NMFS which parts the applicant believes to be inaccurate, and must provide specific credible information to substantiate any requested corrections. The completed application and specific credible information must be provided to NMFS in writing by the application deadline. Written communication must either be post-marked or hand-delivered to NMFS within normal business hours no later than December 26, 2017. Requests for corrections may only be granted for the following reasons:

      (A) Errors in NMFS's use or application of data, including:

      () Errors in NMFS's use or application of landings data from PacFIN;

      () Errors in NMFS's application of the reallocation formula; and

      () Errors in identification of the QS permit owner, permit combinations, or vessel registration as listed in NMFS permit database.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (vii) —(A)  Submission of the complete, certified application includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      () The applicant is required to sign and date the application and declare that the contents are true, correct and complete.

      () The applicant must certify that they qualify to own reallocated widow rockfish QS.

      () The applicant must indicate they accept NMFS's calculation of reallocated widow rockfish QS provided in the prequalified application, or provide a written statement and credible information if they do not accept NMFS's calculation.

      () NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to make an IAD on reallocated widow rockfish QS.

      (B)  A complete, certified application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours to NMFS, West Coast Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115, no later than December 26, 2017. NMFS will not accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the application deadline. There are no hardship exemptions for this deadline.

      (viii)  NMFS will issue an IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for reallocated widow rockfish QS, the IAD will say so, and the applicant will receive a 2018 QS permit specifying the reallocated amount of widow rockfish QS the applicant has qualified for. If NMFS disapproves or partially disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons. As part of the IAD, NMFS will indicate to the best of its knowledge whether the QS permit owner qualifies for QS or IBQ in amounts that exceed the accumulation limits and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (ix)  For reallocated widow rockfish QS issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C. For the reallocation of widow rockfish QS, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (d)(9)(vi) of this section. Items not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of permit landings data in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 27, 2016.

      (e) —(1)  In order to participate in the Shorebased IFQ Program, a vessel must be registered to an eligible limited entry trawl permit. A vessel account will be established on request for an owner of a vessel registered to an eligible limited entry trawl permit in order to track QP and IBQ pounds. QP or IBQ pounds will have the same species/species groups and area designations as the QS or IBQ from which it was issued. Annually, QS or IBQ (expressed as a percent) are converted to QP or IBQ pounds (expressed as a weight) in a QS account. QP or IBQ pounds may be transferred from a QS account to a vessel account or from one vessel account to another vessel account. QP or IBQ pounds are required to cover catch (landings and discards) by limited entry trawl vessels of all IFQ species/species groups, except for:

      (i)  Vessels registered to a limited entry trawl permit using the following gears would not be required to cover groundfish catch with QP or Pacific halibut catch with IBQ pounds: Non-groundfish trawl, gear types defined in the coastal pelagic species FMP, gear types defined in the highly migratory species FMP, salmon troll, crab pot, and limited entry fixed gear when the vessel also has a limited entry permit endorsed for fixed gear and has declared that it is fishing in the limited entry fixed gear fishery. Vessels using gears falling under this exception are subject to the open access fishery restrictions and limits when declared in to an open access fishery.

      (ii)  QP are not required for the following species: Longspine thornyheads south of 34°27′ N. lat., minor nearshore rockfish (north and south), black rockfish (coastwide), California scorpionfish, cabezon, kelp greenling, shortbelly rockfish, and “other fish” (as defined at § 660.11, subpart C, under the definition of “groundfish”). For these species, trip limits remain in place as specified in the trip limit tables at Table 1 (North) and Table 1 (South) of this subpart.

      (2) —(i)  To establish a registered vessel account, a person must own a vessel and that vessel must be registered to a groundfish limited entry permit endorsed for trawl gear.

      (ii)  A vessel account must be registered with the NMFS SFD Permits Office. A vessel account may be established at any time during the year. An eligible vessel owner must submit a request in writing to NMFS to establish a vessel account. The request must include the vessel name; USCG vessel registration number (as given on USCG Form 1270) or state registration number, if no USCG documentation; all vessel owner names (as given on USCG Form 1270, or on state registration, as applicable); and business contact information, including: Address, phone number, fax number, and email. Requests for a vessel account must also include the following information: A complete economic data collection form as required under § 660.113(b), (c) and (d), and a complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. The request for a vessel account will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. Any change specified at paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, including a change in the legal name of the vessel owner(s), will require the new owner to register with NMFS for a vessel account. A participant must have access to a computer with internet access and must set up online access to their vessel account to participate. NMFS will provide vessel account owners instructions to set up online access to their vessel account. NMFS will use the vessel account to send messages to vessel owners in the Shorebased IFQ Program; it is important for vessel owners to monitor their online vessel account and all associated messages.

      (3) —(i)  (A) Vessel accounts expire at the end of each calendar year, and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in order to ensure the vessel account is active on January 1 of the following year. A complete vessel account renewal package must be received by SFD no later than November 30 to be accepted by NMFS.

      (B) Notification to renew vessel accounts will be issued by SFD by September 15 each year to the vessel account owner's most recent email address in the SFD record. The vessel account owner shall provide SFD with notice of any email address change within 15 days of the change.

      (C) Any vessel account for which SFD does not receive a vessel account renewal request by November 30 will have its vessel account inactivated by NMFS at the end of the calendar year. NMFS will not issue QP or IBQ pounds to the inactivated vessel account. Any QP or IBQ pounds in the vessel account will expire and surplus QP or IBQ pounds will not be available for carryover. A non-renewed vessel account may be renewed in a subsequent year by submission of a complete vessel account renewal package.

      (D) Vessel accounts will not be renewed until SFD has received a complete application for a vessel account renewal, which includes payment of required fees, a complete documentation of permit ownership on the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, and a complete economic data collection form as required under § 660.114. The vessel account renewal will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted.

      (E)  A vessel account is effective on the date issued by NMFS and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.

      (F)  Vessel account renewals are subject to the appeals process specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (ii)  Vessel accounts are non-transferable and ownership of a vessel account cannot change (, cannot change the legal name of the owner(s) as given on the vessel account). If the ownership of a vessel changes (as given on a USCG or state vessel registration documentation), then a new vessel account must be opened by the new owner in order for the vessel to participate in the Shorebased IFQ Program.

      (iii) —(A)  QP or IBQ pounds may only be transferred from a QS account to a vessel account or between vessel accounts. QP or IBQ pounds cannot be transferred from a vessel account to a QS account. Transfers of QP or IBQ pounds are subject to annual vessel accumulation limits. QP or IBQ pounds must be transferred in whole pounds ( no fraction of a QP or IBQ pound can be transferred). During the year there may be situations where NMFS deems it necessary to prohibit transfers ( account reconciliation, system maintenance, or for emergency fishery management reasons).

      (B)  QP or IBQ pound transfers from one vessel account to another vessel account must be accomplished via the online vessel account. To make a transfer, a vessel account owner must initiate a transfer request by logging onto the online vessel account. Following the instructions provided on the website, the vessel account owner must enter pertinent information regarding the transfer request including, but not limited to: IFQ species, amount of QP or IBQ pounds to be transferred for each IFQ species (in whole pound increments); name and any other identifier of the eligible transferee ( USCG documentation number or state registration number, as applicable) of the eligible vessel account receiving the transfer; and the value of the transferred QP or IBQ pounds. The online system will verify whether all information has been entered and whether the transfer complies with vessel limits, as applicable. If the information is not accepted, an electronic message will record as much in the transferor's vessel account explaining the reason(s). If the information is accepted, the online system will record the pending transfer in both the transferor's and the transferee's vessel accounts. The transferee must approve the transfer by electronic signature. If the transferee accepts the transfer, the online system will record the transfer and confirm the transaction in both accounts through a transaction confirmation notice. Once the transferee accepts the transaction, the transaction is final and permanent. QP or IBQ pounds may be transferred between vessel accounts at any time during January 1 through December 31 each year unless otherwise notified by NMFS. Unused QP from the previous fishing year (base year) may be transferred for the purpose of covering end-of-the-year vessel account deficits through the end of the post-season transfer period described at paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.

      (4) —(i)  For each IFQ species or species group specified in this paragraph, vessel accounts may not have QP or IBQ pounds in excess of the annual QP vessel limit in any year, except as allowed by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section. The annual QP vessel limit is calculated as all QPs transferred in minus all QPs transferred out of the vessel account.

      (ii)  Any person that owns a vessel registered to a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or renewing a vessel account shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the vessel greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will not generate and issue a vessel account unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits.

      (5)  The carryover provision allows a limited amount of surplus QP or IBQ pounds in a vessel account to be carried over from one year (the base year) to the next immediately following year or allows a deficit in a vessel account from fishing during the base year to be covered in the immediately following year with QP or IBQ pounds from the base year or the a immediately following year, up to a carryover limit without violating the provisions of this section.

      (i)  A vessel account with a surplus of QP or IBQ (unused QP or IBQ pounds) for any IFQ species following the post-season transfer period specified at paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section, may carryover for use in the year immediately following the base year amounts of unused QP or IBQ pounds up to its carryover limit specified at (e)(5)(ii) of this section, and subject to the limitations of this paragraph. After the post-season transfer period is concluded, NMFS will complete determination of surplus QP or IBQ pound amounts that may be carried over into the following year up to the surplus carryover limit specified at paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. The amount of surplus QP or IBQ pounds issued as carryover will be reduced in proportion to any reduction in the ACL-between the base year and the immediately following year. At the end of the post-season transfer period, any base year QP or IBQ pounds remaining in vessel accounts will be suspended from use while NMFS calculates annual surplus carryover amounts. NMFS will consult with the Council in making its final determination of the IFQ species and total QP or IBQ amounts to be issued as annual surplus carryover. After NMFS completes determination of the annual surplus carryover amounts for each vessel account, suspended QP or IBQ pounds in excess of the annual surplus carryover amount will expire. NMFS will subsequently release any remaining suspended QP or IBQ pounds for issuance as surplus carryover to vessel accounts from which they were suspended, and notify vessel account owners of the issuance. Surplus carryover QP or IBQ pounds are valid for the year in which they are issued ( the year immediately following the base year). Surplus carryover amounts that would place a vessel above the annual QP vessel limits for the immediately following year (specified at paragraph (e)(4) of this section) will not be issued. Amounts issued as surplus QP or IBQ pounds do not change the shorebased trawl allocation in the year in which the carryover was issued. Surplus QP or IBQ pounds may not be carried over for more than one year.

      (ii)  The limit for the surplus carryover is calculated by multiplying 10 percent by the cumulative total QP or IBQ pounds (used and unused) transferred into a vessel account for the base year, less any transfers out of the vessel account, QP resulting from reapportionment of whiting specified at § 660.60(d), additional QP issued to the account during the year (as specified at § 660.60(c)(3)(ii)), and previous carryover amounts. The percentage used for the carryover surplus limit may be changed by Council recommendation during the biennial specifications and management measures process or by routine management measures as specified in § 660.60(c).

      (iii)  After the end of the base year, a vessel account may cover the full amount of any deficit (negative balance) of QP or IBQ pounds using QP or IBQ from the following year, base year QP or IBQ pounds, through the post-season transfer period, or a combination, without restriction by annual QP vessel limits. A vessel account acquiring QP or IBQ after the base year to cover a deficit resulting from catch in excess of the base year annual QP vessel limits may still be in violation of annual vessel QP limit provisions specified at paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, or other provisions of this section, if the deficit exceeds the deficit carryover limit specified at paragraph (e)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. If an IFQ species is reallocated between the base year and the following year due to changes in management areas or subdivision of a species group as specified at paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section, a vessel account will not carryover the deficit for that IFQ species into the following year. A vessel account with a deficit for any IFQ species in the base year may cover that deficit during the post-season transfer period or with QP or IBQ pounds from the following year without violating the provisions of this section if all of the following conditions are met:

      (A) The vessel account owner declares out of the Shorebased IFQ Program for the remainder of the year in which the deficit occurred. The vessel account owner must submit a signed, dated, and notarized letter to OLE, declaring out of the Shorebased IFQ Program for the remainder of the year and invoking the carryover provision to cover the deficit. Signed, dated, and notarized letters may be submitted to NMFS, West Coast Region, Office of Law Enforcement, ATTN VMS, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115. If the vessel account owner covers the deficit later within the same calendar year, the vessel may re-enter the Shorebased IFQ Program. If the deficit is documented less than 30 days before the end of the calendar year, exiting out of the Shorebased IFQ Program for the remainder of the year is not required.

      (B) The amount of QP or IBQ pounds required to cover the deficit from the current fishing year is less than or equal to the vessel's carryover limit for a deficit. The carryover limit for a deficit is calculated as 10 percent of the total cumulative QP or IBQ pounds (used and unused, less any transfers out of the vessel account, and any previous carryover amounts) in the vessel account 30 days after the date the deficit is documented;

      (C) Sufficient QP or IBQ pounds are transferred into the vessel account to cure the deficit within 30 days of NMFS' issuance of QP or IBQ pounds to QS accounts in the following year or the date the deficit is documented (whichever is later) but not later than the end of the post-season transfer period; and

      (D) The total QP required to cover the vessel's total catch from the base year is not greater than the annual QP vessel limit for the base year.

      (iv)  A vessel account with a deficit (negative balance) of QP or IBQ pounds after December 31 for any IFQ species may conduct post-season transfers to cure the deficit by obtaining available unused QP or IBQ pounds remaining in other vessel accounts from the base fishing year. Vessel account owners may conduct post-season transfers of QP and IBQ pounds according to transfer procedures specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, and subject to the following conditions:

      (A) Post-season transfers may be conducted during a period starting January 1 and ending 14 calendar days after NMFS has completed its determination of the total base year IFQ catch for all vessels for end-of-the-year account reconciliation. NMFS will issue a public notice when end-of-the-year account reconciliation has been completed, on or about March 1 of each year.

      (B) QP or IBQ pounds from the base fishing year transferred during the post-season transfer period may not be fished in any way, and may only be transferred for the purpose of covering deficits carried into the immediately following fishing year from the base fishing year.

      (C) After the post-season transfer period, remaining QP and IBQ pounds surplus and deficits from the base fishing year are subject to carryover provisions specified at paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) and (e)(5)(iii) of this section.

      (6)  An appeal to a vessel account action follows the appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (7)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the vessel accounts consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (8)  The fish seller, as defined at § 660.111, is subject to the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.

      (f) —(1)  The first receiver site license authorizes the holder to receive, purchase, or take custody, control, or possession of an IFQ landing at a specific physical site onshore directly from a vessel. Each buyer of groundfish from a vessel making an IFQ landing must have a first receiver site license for each physical location where the IFQ landing is offloaded.

      (2)  (i) First receiver site licenses will only be issued to a person registered to a valid license issued by the state of Washington, Oregon, or California, and that authorizes the person to receive fish from a catcher vessel.

      (ii) An IFQ first receiver must have a separate first receiver site license for each unique physical location where the IFQ first receiver will receive, purchase or take custody, control, or take possession of an IFQ landing from a vessel.

      (iii) An IFQ first receiver may apply for a first receiver site license at any time during the calendar year.

      (iv) IFQ first receivers must reapply for a first receiver site license as specified at paragraphs (f)(6) and (7) of this section:

      (3)  Persons interested in being licensed as an IFQ first receiver for a specific physical location must submit a complete application for a first receiver site license through the web form submission available at  First receiver site license holders may request a paper application by contacting SFD. NMFS will only consider complete applications for approval. A complete application includes:

      (i)  The license owner must provide a copy of a valid license issued by the state in which they operate that allows the person to receive fish from a catcher vessel.

      (ii)  A completed IFQ first receiver application form provided by NMFS, signed and dated by an authorized representative of the first receiver. To be considered complete, the form must also be notarized.

      (iii)  All IFQ first receivers must prepare and operate under a NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan for each specific physical location. A proposed catch monitoring plan detailing how the IFQ first receiver will meet each of the performance standards in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section must be included with the application. NMFS will not issue a first receiver site license to a person that does not have a current, NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan.

      (A)  NMFS will accept a catch monitoring plan if it includes all the required elements specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and conforms with the actual operations and layout at the site. A site inspection is required for new first receiver site licenses. For re-registration of an existing first receiver site license, the site must be inspected at least once every three years or more frequently, as deemed necessary by NMFS, or by a NMFS designated representative. If NMFS does not accept a catch monitoring plan for any reason, a new or revised catch monitoring plan may be required of the first receiver.

      (B)  After receiving a complete application for a first receiver site license, if a site inspection is required, NMFS will contact the applicant to schedule a site inspection. A complete application for a first receiver site license must include the proposed catch monitoring plan. NMFS may request a representative of the first receiver to be at the site at the time of inspection. If the requested representative of the first receiver is not made available for the inspection, the site inspection may be postponed until the requested representative of the first receiver is made available.

      (C)  The catch monitoring plan must:

      ()  Describe the amount and location of all space used for sorting catch, the number of staff assigned to catch sorting, and the maximum rate that catch will flow through the sorting area.

      ()  Detail how IFQ first receiver staff will ensure that sorting is complete; what steps will be taken to prevent unsorted catch from entering the factory or other areas beyond the location where catch sorting and weighing can be monitored from the observation area; and what steps will be taken if unsorted catch enters the factory or other areas beyond the location where catch sorting and weighing can be monitored from the observation area.

      ()  Identify each scale that will be used to weigh IFQ landings by the type and capacity and describe where it is located and what it will be used for. Each scale must be appropriate for its intended use.

      ()  Identify all scales that will be used to weigh IFQ landings that cannot produce a complete printed record as specified at § 660.15(c), subpart C. State how the scale will be used, and how the plant intends to produce a complete and accurate record of the total weight of each delivery.

      ()  Detail how the IFQ first receiver will ensure that all catch is weighed and the process used to meet the catch weighing requirements specified at paragraph (j) of this section. If a catch monitoring plan proposes the use of totes in which IFQ species will be weighed, or a deduction for the weight of ice, the catch monitoring plan must detail how the process will accurately account for the weight of ice and/or totes.

      ()  Identify specific delivery points where catch is removed from an IFQ vessel. The delivery point is the first location where fish removed from a delivering catcher vessel can be sorted or diverted to more than one location. If the catch is pumped from the hold of a catcher vessel or a codend, the delivery point will be the location where the pump first discharges the catch. If catch is removed from a vessel by brailing, the delivery point normally will be the bin or belt where the brailer discharges the catch.

      ()  Designate and describe the observation area. The observation area is a location where a catch monitor may monitor the flow of fish during a delivery, including: Access to the observation area, the flow of fish, and lighting used during periods of limited visibility. Standards for the observation area are specified at paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section.

      ()  Identify the location of a secure, dry, and lockable cabinet or locker with the minimum interior dimensions of two feet wide by two feet tall by two feet deep for the exclusive use of the catch monitor, NMFS staff, or authorized officers.

      ()  Identify the designated plant liaison. The plant liaison responsibilities are specified at paragraph (i)(6) of this section.

      ()  The catch monitoring plan must be accompanied by a diagram of the plant showing:

      () The del_i_very point(s);

      () The observation area;

      () The lockable cabinet;

      () The location of each scale used to weigh catch; and

      () Each location where catch is sorted.

      ()  Describe how the electronic fish ticket submittal requirements specified at § 660._11_3(b)(4)(ii) will be met.

      ()  Print the name of the first receiver, physical location of the first receiver, name and phone number of the applicant, and the date of the application. The applicant must sign the catch monitoring plan.

      (D)  NMFS will accept a catch monitoring plan if it includes the required elements specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and conforms with the actual operations and layout at the site. For the first receiver site license to remain in effect, the owner or manager must notify NMFS in writing of any and all changes made in IFQ first receiver operations or layout that do not conform to the catch monitoring plan.

      (E)  An owner and manager may change an accepted catch monitoring plan by submitting a plan addendum to NMFS. NMFS will accept the modified catch monitoring plan if it continues to meet the performance standards specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. Depending on the nature and magnitude of the change requested, NMFS may require an additional catch monitoring plan inspection. A catch monitoring plan addendum must contain:

      () Name and signature of the person submitting the addendum;

      () Address, telephone number, fax number and email address (if available) of the person submitting the addendum;

      () A complete description of the proposed catch monitoring plan change.

      (iv)  A first receiver site license application must include a complete economic data collection form as required under § 660.113(b), subpart D. The application for a first receiver site license will be marked incomplete until the required information is submitted.

      (4)  For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if the application is disapproved. The IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. NMFS will not reissue a first receiver site license until the required cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115, have been paid. The IAD, appeals, and final decision process for the cost recovery program is specified at § 660.115(d)(3)(ii).

      (5)  The first receiver site license is valid from the effective date identified on the license until June 30, or until the state license required by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is no longer effective, whichever occurs first. A first receiver site license may not be valid for more than 365 days.

      (6)  Existing first receiver site license holders must reapply annually by following the application process specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the existing license holder fails to reapply, the first receiver site license will expire as specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. NMFS will not reissue a first receiver site license until all required cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115, associated with that license have been paid. For existing first receiver site license holders to continue to receive IFQ landings without a lapse in the effectiveness of their first receiver site license, the following re-registration deadlines apply:

      (i) First receiver site license applications will be accessible through an online application on or about February 1 each year.

      (ii) Applicants who want to have their new license effective for July 1 must submit their complete re-registration application to NMFS by April 15. For those first receiver site license holders who do not submit a complete re-registration application by April 15, NMFS may not be able to issue the new license by July 1 of that calendar year, and will issue the new license as soon as practicable.

      (7)  If there are any changes to the owner of a first receiver registered to a first receiver site license during a calendar year, the first receiver site license is void. The new owner of the first receiver must apply to NMFS for a first receiver site license. A first receiver site license may not be registered to any other person.

      (8)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with processing the application consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (9)  If NMFS does not accept the first receiver site license application through an IAD, the applicant may appeal the IAD consistent with the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (10)  The first receiver site license holder is considered the fish buyer as defined at § 660.111, and must comply with the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.

      (g) —(1)  Shorebased IFQ Program vessels may discard IFQ species/species groups, provided such discards are accounted for and deducted from QP in the vessel account. The discard mortality for those species with discard mortality rates must be accounted for and applied to QP in the vessel account. With the exception of vessels on a declared Pacific whiting IFQ trip and engaged in maximized retention, and vessels fishing under a valid EM Authorization in accordance with § 660.604, prohibited and protected species (except short-tailed albatross as directed by § 660.21(c)(1)(v)) must be discarded at sea. Pacific halibut must be discarded as soon as practicable and the discard mortality must be accounted for and deducted from IBQ pounds in the vessel account. Non-IFQ species and non-groundfish species may be discarded at sea, unless otherwise required by EM Program requirements at § 660.604. The sorting of catch, the weighing and discarding of any IBQ and IFQ species, and the retention of IFQ species must be monitored by the observer or EM system.

      (2)  Vessels on Pacific whiting IFQ trips may engage in maximized retention. Maximized retention allows for the discard minor operational amounts of catch at sea if the observer has accounted for the discard. Vessels engaged in maximized retention must retain prohibited species until landing. Protected species may be retained until landing except as provided under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Pacific halibut must be accounted for and deducted from IBQ pounds in the vessel account.

      (3) —(i)  To ensure compliance with fishery regulations at 50 CFR part 300, subparts E and F, and part 600, subpart H; with the Pacific Salmon Fishery Management Plan; and with the Pacific Halibut Catch Share Plan; the handling and disposition of all prohibited species in maximized retention landings are the responsibility of the first receiver and must be consistent with the following requirements:

      (A) Any prohibited species landed at first receivers must not be transferred, processed, or mixed with another landing until the catch monitor has: recorded the number and weight of salmon by species; inspected all prohibited species for tags or marks; and, collected biological data, specimens, and genetic samples.

      (B) No part of any prohibited species may be retained for personal use by a vessel owner or crew member, or by a first receiver or processing crew member. No part of any prohibited species may be allowed to reach commercial markets.

      (C) Prohibited species suitable for human consumption at landing must be handled and stored to preserve the quality. Priority in disposition must be given to the donation to surplus food collection and distribution system operated and established to assist in bringing donated food to nonprofit charitable organizations and individuals for the purpose of reducing hunger and meeting nutritional needs.

      (D) The first receiver must report all prohibited species landings on the electronic fish ticket and is responsible for maintaining records verifying the disposition of prohibited species. Records on catch disposition may include, but are not limited to: Receipts from charitable organizations that include the organization's name and amount of catch donated; cargo manifests setting forth the origin, weight, and destination of all prohibited species; or disposal receipts identifying the recipient organization and amount disposed. Any such records must be maintained for a period not less than three years after the date of disposal and such records must be provided to OLE upon request.

      (ii)  All protected species must be abandoned to NMFS or the US Fish and Wildlife Service or disposed of consistent with paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. No part of any protected species may be retained for personal use by a vessel owner or crew member, or by a first receiver or processing crew member. No part of any protected species may be allowed to reach commercial markets.

      (A)  Must be sorted and reported by species on electronic fish tickets and state landing receipts and may not be reported in unspecified categories. Whole body specimens of green sturgeon must be retained, frozen, stored separately by delivery, and labeled with the vessel name, electronic fish ticket number, and date of landing. Arrangements for transferring the specimens must be made by contacting NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center at 831-420-3903 within 72 hours after the completion of the offload.

      (B)  Short-tailed albatross must be reported as soon as possible and directions for surrendering must be followed as directed by § 660.21(c)(1)(v). Marine mammals and sea turtles must be reported to NMFS as soon as possible (206-526-6550) and directions for surrendering or disposal must be followed. Whole body specimens must be labeled with the vessel name, electronic fish ticket number, and date of landing. Whole body specimens must be kept frozen or on ice until arrangements for surrendering or disposing are completed. Unless directed otherwise, after reporting is completed, seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles may be disposed by incinerating, rendering, composting, or returning the carcasses to sea.

      (h) —(1) —(i)  The following observer coverage pertains to certified observers obtained from an observer provider permitted by NMFS.

      (A)  The observation area must be freely accessible to NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or authorized officers at any time a valid catch monitoring plan is required.

      (B)  The catch monitor must have an unobstructed view or otherwise be able to monitor the entire flow of fish between the delivery point and a location where all sorting has takes place and each species has been weighed.

      (C)  Adequate lighting must be provided during periods of limited visibility.

      (iii) Each IFQ first receiver must allow catch monitors free and unobstructed access to any documentation required by regulation including fish tickets, scale printouts and scale test results.

      (5)  Each IFQ first receiver must provide a secure, dry, and lockable cabinet or locker with the minimum interior dimensions of two feet wide by two feet tall by two feet deep for the exclusive use the catch monitor and NMFS staff or NMFS-authorized agents.

      (6)  Each IFQ first receiver must designate a plant liaison. The plant liaison is responsible for:

      (i) Orienting new catch monitors to the facility;

      (ii) Assisting in the resolution of catch monitoring concerns; and

      (iii) Informing NMFS if changes must be made to the catch monitoring plan.

      (7)  Each IFQ first receiver must provide reasonable assistance to the catch monitors to enable each catch monitor to carry out his or her duties. Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to: informing the monitor when bycatch species will be weighed, and providing a secure place to store equipment and gear.

      (j) —(1)  All IFQ first receivers must operate under a NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan for each specific physical location where IFQ landings will be received, purchased, or taken custody, control, or possession of.

      (2) —(i)  The IFQ first receiver must ensure that all IFQ species received from a vessel making an IFQ landing are weighed on a scale(s) that meets the requirements specified at § 660.15(c).

      (ii)  All scales identified in the catch monitoring plan accepted by NMFS during the first receiver site license application process, must produce a printed record as specified at § 660.15(c).

      (iii)  An IFQ first receiver that receives no more than 200,000 pounds of groundfish in any calendar month will be exempt from the requirement to produce a printed record provided that:

      (A) The first receiver has not previously operated under a catch monitoring plan where a printed record was required;

      (B) The first receiver ensures that all catch is weighed; and

      (C) The catch monitor, NMFS staff, or authorized officer can verify that all catch is weighed.

      (iv)  An IFQ first receiver must maintain printouts on site until the end of the fishing year during which the printouts were made consistent with § 660.113(a)(2).

      (v)  An IFQ first receiver must ensure that it is possible for the catch monitor, NMFS staff, or authorized officer to verify the weighing of all catch.

      (vi)  All fish delivered to the plant must be sorted and weighed by species as specified at § 660.130(d).

      (vii)  Sorting and weighing must be completed prior to catch leaving the area that can be monitored from the catch monitor's observation area.

      (viii)  Immediately following weighing of the total catch and prior to processing or transport away from the point of landing, the catch must be sorted to the species groups specified at § 660.130(d) and all catch other than the target species (groundfish and non groundfish species) must be accurately weighed and the weight of non-target species deducted from the total catch weight to derive the weight of a single predominant species. Catch from a Pacific whiting IFQ trip may be sorted after weighing and the weight of a single predominant species determined by deducting the weight of all other species from the total weight of the landing, provided that:

      (A) The unsorted catch is weighed on a bulk weighing scale in compliance with equipment requirements at § 660.15(c);

      (B) All catch (groundfish and non-groundfish species) in the landing other than the single predominant species is reweighed on a scale in compliance with equipment requirements at § 660.15(c) and the reweighed catch is deducted from the total weight of the landing;

      (C) The catch is sorted to the species groups specified at § 660.130(d) prior to processing or transport away from the point of landing; and

      (D) Prohibited species are sorted by species, counted, and weighed.

      (ix) For all other IFQ landings the following weighing standards apply:

      (A) A belt or automatic hopper scale may be used to weigh all of the catch prior to sorting. All but a single predominant species must then be reweighed.

      (B) An in-line conveyor or automatic hopper scale may be used to weigh the single predominant species after catch has been sorted. Other species must be weighed in a manner that facilitates tracking of the weights of those species.

      (C) IFQ species or species group may be weighed in totes on a platform scale capable of printing a label or tag and recording the label or tag information to memory for printing a report as specified at § 660.15. The label or tag must remain affixed to the tote until the tote is emptied. The label or tag must show the following information:

      () The species or species group;

      () The weight of the fish in the tote;

      () The date the label or tag was printed; and

      () The vessel name.

      (D)  If a catch monitoring plan proposes the use of totes in which fish will be weighed, or a deduction for the weight of ice, the deduction must be accurately accounted for. No deduction may be made for the weight of water or slime. This standard may be met by:

      () Taring the empty or pre-iced tote on the scale prior to filling with fish;

      () Labeling each tote with an individual tare weight. This weight must be accurate within 500 grams (1 pound if scale is denominated in pounds) for any given tote and the average error for all totes may not exceed _2_00 grams (8 ounces for scales denominated in pounds);

      () An alternate approach accepted by NMFS. NMFS will only accept approaches that do not involve the estimation of the weight of ice or the weight of totes and allow NMFS staff or an authorized officer to verify that the deduction or tare weight is accurate.

      (E) An alternate approach accepted by NMFS in the catch monitoring plan.

      (3)  The IFQ first receiver must:

      (i)  Ensure that all IFQ landings are sorted and weighed as specified at § 660.130(d) and in accordance with an approved catch monitoring plan.

      (ii)  (A) Have a catch monitor on site the entire time an IFQ landing is being offloaded, sorted, or weighed.

      (B) Notify the catch monitor of the offloading schedule.

      (C) Provide catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer with unobstructed access to any areas where IFQ species are or may be sorted or weighed at any time IFQ species are being landed or processed.

      (D) Ensure that catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer are able to simultaneously observe the weighing of catch on the scale and read the scale display at any time.

      (E) Ensure that printouts of the scale weight of each delivery or offload are made available to catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer at the time printouts are generated.

      (4)  All testing must meet the scale test standards specified at § 660.15(c).

      (k)  (1) Participants in the Shorebased IFQ Program may take IFQ species using any legal groundfish non-trawl gear (, gear switching) and are exempt from the gear endorsements at § 660.25(b)(3) for limited entry fixed gear permits, provided the following requirements are met:

      (i) The vessel must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit.

      (ii) The vessel must be registered to a vessel account that is not in deficit on any IFQ species.

      (iii) The vessel operator must have submitted a valid gear declaration for the trip that declares “Limited entry groundfish non-trawl, shorebased IFQ,” as specified in § 660.13(d)(5)(iv)(A), and does not declare any other designation (a Shorebased IFQ Program trip may not be combined with any other designation).

      (iv) The vessel must comply with prohibitions applicable to the limited entry fixed gear fishery as specified at § 660.212, gear restrictions applicable to limited entry fixed gear as specified in §§ 660.219 and 660.230(b), and management measures specified in § 660.230(d), including restrictions on the fixed gear allowed onboard, its usage, and applicable fixed gear groundfish conservation area restrictions, except that the vessel will not be subject to limited entry fixed gear trip limits when fishing in the Shorebased IFQ Program. Vessels using bottom longline and snap gears as defined at § 660.11 are subject to the requirements of the Seabird Avoidance Program described in § 660.21.

      (v) The vessel must comply with the limited entry trawl trip limits for species/species groups not covered under the Shorebased IFQ Program or whiting trip limits outside the primary season.

      (vi) The vessel must comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to limited entry trawl gear as specified in § 660.113.

      (vii) The vessel must comply with and observer requirements and all other provisions of the Shoreside IFQ Program as specified in this section.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (l) —(1)  The adaptive management program (AMP) is a set-aside of 10 percent of the non-whiting QS to address the following objectives:

      (i) Community stability;

      (ii) Processor stability;

      (iii) Conservation;

      (iv) Unintended/unforeseen consequences of IFQ management; or

      (v) Facilitating new entrants.

      (2)  The 10 percent of non-whiting QS will be reserved for the AMP, but the resulting AMP QP will be issued to all QS permit owners in proportion to their non-whiting QS until an alternative use of AMP QP is implemented.

      § 660.150   Mothership (MS) Co-op Program.

#### § § 660.150

      (a)  The MS Co-op Program is a general term to describe the limited access program that applies to eligible harvesters and processors in the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting at-sea trawl fishery. Eligible harvesters and processors, including co-op and non-cooperative fishery participants, must meet the requirements set forth in this section of the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations. Each year a vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit may fish in either the co-op or non-cooperative portion of the MS Co-op Program, but not both. In addition to the requirements of this section, the MS Co-op Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations of subparts C and D of this part:

      (1) Pacific whiting seasons § 660.131(b), subpart D.

      (2) Area restrictions specified for midwater trawl gear used to harvest Pacific whiting fishery specified at § 660.131(c), Subpart D for GCAs, RCAs, Salmon Conservation Zones, BRAs, and EFHCAs.

      (5) The MS Co-op Program may be restricted or closed as a result of projected overages within the MS Co-op Program, the C/P Co-op Program, or the Shorebased IFQ Program. As determined necessary by the Regional Administrator, area restrictions, season closures, or other measures will be used to prevent the trawl sectors in aggregate or the individual trawl sector (Shorebased IFQ, MS Co-op, or C/P Co-op) from exceeding an ACL, ACT, or formal allocation specified in the PCGFMP or regulation at § 660.55, subpart C, or §§ 660.140, 660.150, or 660.160, subpart D.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  A vessel is eligible to receive and process catch as a mothership in the MS Co-op Program if:

      (A) The vessel is registered to an MS permit; and

      (B) The vessel is not used to fish as a catcher vessel in the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting fishery in the same calendar year.

      (ii)  The owner and operator of a mothership vessel must:

      (A)  Maintain a valid declaration as specified at § 660.13(d); maintain records as specified at § 660.113(a); and maintain and submit all records and reports specified at § 660.113(c) including, economic data, scale tests records, cease fishing reports, and cost recovery.

      (B)  As specified at paragraph (j) of this section, procure observer services, maintain the appropriate level of coverage, and meet the vessel responsibilities.

      (C)  The owner and operator of a mothership vessel must:

      () Ensure that all catch is weighed in its round form on a NMFS-approved scale that meets the requirements described in section § 660._1_5(b);

      () Provide a NMFS-approved platform scale, belt scale, and test weights that meet the requirements described in section § 660.15(b).

      (D)  Collect and remit to NMFS cost recovery program fees as specified at § 660.115.

      (2) —(i) —(A) A vessel is eligible to harvest in the MS Co-op Program if the following conditions are met:

      () If the vessel is used to fish as a mothership catcher vessel for a permitted MS co-op, the vessel is registered to a limited entry permit with a trawl endorsement and NMFS has been notified that the vessel is authorized to fish for the co-op.

      () If the vessel is used to harvest fish in the non-cooperative fishery, the vessel is registered to an MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit.

      () The vessel does not catch more than _3_0 percent of the Pacific whiting allocation for the mothership sector.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (ii) —(A)  As specified at paragraph (j) of this section, procure observer services, maintain the appropriate level of coverage, and meet the vessel responsibilities.

      (B)  Maintain a valid declaration as specified at § 660.13(d), subpart C; and, maintain and submit all records and reports specified at § 660.113(c) including, economic data and scale tests records, if applicable.

      (C)  Vessel must pay cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115.

      (3) —(i)  For a MS co-op to participate in the Pacific whiting mothership sector fishery it must:

      (A) Be issued a MS co-op permit;

      (B) Be composed of MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners;

      (C) Be formed voluntarily;

      (D) Be a legally recognized entity that represents its members;

      (E) Designate an individual as a co-op manager; and

      (F) Include at least 20 percent of all MS/CV-endorsed permits as members. The co-op membership percentage will be interpreted by rounding to the nearest whole permit (, less than 0.5 rounds down and 0.5 and greater rounds up).

      (ii)  A MS co-op is responsible for:

      (A) Applying for and being registered to a MS co-op permit;

      (B) Organizing and coordinating harvest activities of vessels authorized to fish for the co-op;

      (C) Reassigning catch history assignments for use by co-op members;

      (D) Organizing and coordinating the transfer and leasing of catch allocations with other permitted co-ops through inter-co-op agreements;

      (E) Monitoring harvest activities and enforcing the catch limits of co-op members;

      (F) Submitting an annual report.

      (G) Having a designated co-op manager. The designated co-op manager must:

      () Serve as the contact person between NMFS, the Council, and other co-ops;

      () Be responsible for the annual distribution of catch and bycatch allocations among co-op members;

      () Oversee reassignment of catch allocations within the co-op;

      () Oversee inter-co-op catch allocation reassignments;

      () Prepare and submit an annual report on behalf of the co-op;

      () Be authorized to receive or respond to any legal process in which the co-op is involved; and

      () Notify NMFS if the co-op dissolves.

      (iii)  An MS co-op must comply with the provisions of this section. The MS co-op, member limited entry permit owners, and owners and operators of vessels registered to member limited entry permits, are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each MS co-op, member permit owner, and owner and operator of a vessel registered to a co-op member permit may be charged jointly and severally for violations of the provisions of this section. For purposes of enforcement, an MS co-op is a legal entity that can be subject to NOAA enforcement action for violations of the provisions of this section.

      (c) —(1)  All species other than Pacific whiting are managed with set-asides for the MS and C/P Co-op Programs, as described in the biennial specifications.

      (2)  Annual allocation amount(s) will be determined using the following procedure:

      (i)  Catch history assignments will be based on catch history using the following methodology:

      (A)  Each MS/CV endorsement's associated catch history assignment of Pacific whiting will be annually allocated to a single permitted MS co-op or to the non-coop fishery. If multiple MS/CV endorsements and their associated CHAs are registered to a limited entry permit, that permit may be simultaneously registered to more than one MS co-op or to both a co-op(s) and non-cooperative fishery. Once assigned to a permitted MS co-op or to the non-cooperative fishery, each MS/CV endorsement's catch history assignment remains with that permitted MS co-op or non-cooperative fishery for that calendar year. When the mothership sector allocation is established, the information for the conversion of catch history assignment to pounds will be made available to the public through a  announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS website. The amount of whiting from the catch history assignment will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules ( less than 0.5 rounds down and 0.5 and greater rounds up).

      () In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at § 660._1_31(b)(2)(iii)(B), allocation for Pacific whiting will be made by the start of the season.

      () In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at § 660.131(b)(_2_)(iii)(B), NMFS will issue Pacific whiting allocations in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate Pacific whiting based on the MS Co-op Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of Pacific whiting to the MS Co-op Program.

      (B) —() At-sea set-asides of non-whiting groundfish species will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken. Set asides may be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process as necessary.

      Groundfish species not addressed in paragraph (c)_(2)_(i)(B)() of this section, will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken.

      () Annually a specified amount of the Pacific halibut will be held in reserve as a shared set-aside for bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fisheries and the shorebased trawl sector south of 40°10′ N lat.

      (C)  Rounding rules may affect distribution of the MS Co-op Program allocations among the catch history assignments for individual MS/CV-endorsed permits. NMFS will distribute such allocations to the maximum extent practicable, not to exceed the total allocation.

      (ii) —(A)  Each permitted MS co-op is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is based on the sum of the catch history assignments for each member MS/CV-endorsed permit identified in the NMFS-accepted co-op agreement for a given calendar year. Other limited entry permits registered to vessels that will fish for the co-op do not bring catch allocation to a permitted MS co-op.

      (B)  If all MS/CV-endorsed permits are members of a single co-op in a given year and there is not a non-cooperative fishery, then NMFS will allocate 100 percent of the MS Co-op Program allocation to that co-op.

      (iii) —(A)  The non-cooperative whiting fishery is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is remaining in the mothership sector annual allocation after the deduction of all co-op allocations.

      (B)  Information on the amount of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish with allocations that will be made available to the non-cooperative fishery when the final Pacific whiting specifications for the mothership sector is established and will be announced to the public through a  announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS website.

      (3)  When the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation, or Pacific whiting sub-allocation is reached or is projected to be reached, the following action may be taken:

      (i) Further harvesting, receiving or at-sea processing by a mothership or catcher vessel in the mothership sector is prohibited when the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation is projected to be reached. No additional unprocessed groundfish may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a mothership may continue to process catch that was on board before at-sea processing was prohibited. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a catcher vessel participating in the mothership sector.

      (ii) When a permitted MS co-op sub-allocation of Pacific whiting-is reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in the permitted MS co-op must cease, unless the permitted MS co-op is operating under an NMFS-accepted inter-co-op agreement.

      (iii) When the non-cooperative fishery sub-allocation of Pacific whiting is projected to be reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in the non-cooperative fishery must cease.

      (4) [Reserved]

      (5)  The Regional Administrator will announce in the  when the mothership sector allocation of Pacific whiting is reached, or is projected to be reached, and specify the appropriate action. In order to prevent exceeding an allocation and to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of Pacific whiting may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishers and processors, by email, internet, phone, fax, letter, press release, and/or USCG Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the  in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.

      (6) —(i)  (A) Through an inter-co-op agreement, the designated co-op managers of permitted MS co-ops may distribute Pacific whiting allocations among one or more permitted MS co-ops.

      (B) In the case of a MS co-op failure during the Pacific whiting primary season for the mothership sector, unused allocation associated with the catch history will not be available for harvest by the co-op that failed, by any former members of the co-op that failed, or any other MS co-op for the remainder of that calendar year.

      ()  Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the co-op and non-cooperative fisheries.

      ()  Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the mothership sector and catcher/processor sector. Whiting may not be redistributed to the Shorebased IFQ Program.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  To be an eligible co-op entity a group of MS/CV-endorsed permit owners (co-op members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and represent all of the co-op members.

      (ii)  Each year, a co-op entity intending to participate as a co-op under the MS Co-op Program must submit an application for a MS co-op permit between January 17 and March 17 of the year in which it intends to fish. NMFS will not consider any applications received after March 17. An MS co-op permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it was issued.

      (iii)  The designated co-op manager, on behalf of the co-op entity, must submit a complete application form and include each of the items listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Only complete applications will be considered for issuance of a MS co-op permit. An application will not be considered complete if any required application fees and annual co-op reports have not been received by NMFS. NMFS may request additional supplemental documentation as necessary to make a determination of whether to approve or disapprove the application. Application forms and instruction are available on the NMFS West Coast Region (WCR) website () or by request from NMFS. The designated co-op manager must sign the application acknowledging the responsibilities of a designated co-op manager defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For permit owners with more than one MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA, paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(D) of this section specifies how to join an MS co-op(s).

      (A)  Signed copies of the co-op agreement must be submitted to NMFS before the co-op is authorized to engage in fishing activities. A co-op agreement must include all of the information listed in this paragraph to be considered a complete co-op agreement. NMFS will only review complete co-op agreements. A co-op agreement will not be accepted unless it includes all of the required information; the descriptive items listed in this paragraph appear to meet the stated purpose; and information submitted is correct and accurate.

      ()  Each co-op agreement must be signed by all of the co-op members (MS/CV-endorsed permit owners) and include the following information:

      () A l_i_st of all vessels and permit owners participating in the co-op and their share of the allocated catch history assignments which must match the amount distributed to individual permit owners by NMFS.

      () All MS/CV-endorsed limited entry member permits identified by permit number.

      () A clause indicting that each member MS/CV-endorsed permit's catch history assignment is based on the catch history assignment calculation by NMFS used for distribution to the co-op.

      () A description of the cooperat_iv_e's plan to adequately monitor and account for the catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish, and to monitor and account for the catch of prohibited species.

      () A clause stating that if a permit is registered to a new permit owner during the effecti_v_e period of the co-op agreement, any new owners of that member permit would be co-op members required to comply with membership restrictions in the co-op agreement.

      () A description of the cooperative's enforcement and penalty pro_vi_sions adequate to maintain catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish within the allocations.

      () A description of measures to reduce catch of overfished species.

      () A clause describing the co-op manager's responsibility for managing inter-co-op reassignments of catch history assignment, should any occur.

      () A clause describing how the annual report will be produced to document the cooperative's catch, bycatch data, inseason catch history reassignments and any other significant activities undertaken by the co-op during the year, and the submission deadlines for that report.

      () Identification of the designated co-op manager.

      () Provisions that prohibit member permit owners that have incurred legal sanctions that prevent them from fishing groundfish in the Council region from fishing in the co-op.

      ()  The co-op entity must provide, at the time of annual application, copies of any inter-co-op agreement(s) into which the co-op has entered. Such agreements must incorporate and honor the provisions of the individual co-op agreements for each co-op that is a party to the inter-co-op agreement. Inter-co-op agreements are specified at paragraph (e) of this section.

      (B) —() If NMFS does not accept the co-op agreement, the co-op permit application will be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons the co-op agreement was not accepted by NMFS.

      () Co-op agreements that are not accepted may be resubmitted for review by sufficiently addressing the deficiencies identified in the NMFS letter and resubmitting the entire co-op permit application by the date specified in the NMFS letter.

      () An accepted co-op agreement that was submitted with the MS co-op permit application and for which a MS co-op permit was issued will remain in place through the end of the calendar year. The designated co-op manager must resubmit a complete co-op agreement to NMFS consistent with the co-op agreement contents described in paragraph (d)(_1_)(iii)(A)() of this section if there is a material change to the co-op agreement.

      () Within 7 calendar days following a material change, the designated co-op manager must notify NMFS of the material change. Within 30 calendar days, the designated co-op manger must submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes. NMFS will review the material changes and provide a letter to the co-op manager that either accepts the changes as given or does not accept the revised co-op agreement with a letter stating the reasons that it was not accepted by NMFS. The co-op may resubmit the co-op agreement with further revisions to the material changes responding to NMFS concerns.

      (iv)  A MS co-op permit will be effective upon the date approved by NMFS and will allow fishing from the start of the MS sector primary whiting season until the end of the calendar year or until one or more of the following events occur, whichever comes first:

      (A) NMFS permanently closes the mothership sector fishing season for the year or a specific MS co-op or the designated co-op manager notifies NMFS that the co-op has completed fishing for the calendar year,

      (B) The co-op has reached its Pacific whiting allocation,

      (C) A material change to the co-op agreement has occurred and the designated co-op manager failed to notify NMFS within 7 calendar days of the material change and submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes within 30 calendar days, or

      (D) NMFS has determined that a co-op failure occurred.

      (2)  For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if the application is disapproved. An approved application will result in issuance of the permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. The IAD for a MS co-op permit follows the same requirement as specified for limited entry permits at § 660.25(g)(4)(ii); if the applicant does not appeal the IAD within the 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (3)  An appeal to a MS co-op permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of a MS co-op permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (e) —(1)  Permitted MS co-ops may voluntarily enter into inter-co-op agreements for the purpose of sharing permitted MS co-op allocations of Pacific whiting and allocated non-whiting groundfish. If two or more permitted MS co-ops enter into an inter-co-op agreement, the inter-co-op agreement must incorporate and honor the provisions of each permitted MS co-op subject to the inter-co-op agreement.

      (2)  Inter-co-op agreements must be submitted to NMFS for acceptance.

      (3)  Each designated co-op manager must submit a copy of the inter-co-op agreement signed by both designated co-op managers for review. Complete co-op agreements containing all items listed under paragraph (d)(_1_)(iii)(A)() will be reviewed by NMFS.

      (f)

      (1)  Any vessel that processes or receives deliveries as a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS permit. A vessel registered to an MS permit may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in an MS co-op and/or may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in the non-cooperative fishery at the same time or during the same year.

      (i)  An MS permit does not have a vessel size endorsement. The endorsement provisions at § 660.25(b)(3)(iii), subpart C, do not apply to an MS permit.

      (ii)  Restrictions on a vessel registered to a limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement operating as a mothership are specified at § 660.160, subpart D.

      (2) —(i)  An MS permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4). If a vessel registered to the MS permit will operate as a mothership in the year for which the permit is renewed, the permit owner must make a declaration as part of the permit renewal that while participating in the whiting fishery it will operate solely as a mothership during the calendar year to which its limited entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for the calendar year, even if the permit is registered to a different permit owner during the year, unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit owner. Any request to rescind a declaration must be made by the permit owner and granted in writing by the Regional Administrator before any unprocessed whiting has been taken on board the vessel that calendar year.

      (ii)  An MS permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (iii)  An MS permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (3)  An appeal to an MS permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of an MS permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), Subpart C.

      (5)  The owner of a vessel registered to an MS permit, the operator of a vessel registered to an MS permit, and the owner of the MS permit registered to that vessel, are considered to be the fish buyer as defined at § 660.111, and must comply with the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.

      (g) —(1)  Any vessel that delivers whiting to a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit, except that a vessel registered to limited entry trawl permit without an MS/CV or C/P endorsement may fish for a co-op if authorized by the co-op. Within the MS Co-op Program, an MS/CV-endorsed permit may participate in an MS co-op or in the non-cooperative fishery. An MS/CV-endorsed permit is a limited entry permit and is subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at § 660.25(b), subpart C.

      (i)  NMFS will assign a catch history assignment to each MS/CV-endorsed permit. The catch history assignment is based on the catch history in the Pacific whiting mothership sector during the qualifying years of 1994 through 2003. The catch history assignment is expressed as a percentage of Pacific whiting of the total mothership sector allocation as described at paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Catch history assignments will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules (, decimal amounts from zero up to 0.5 round down and 0.5 up to 1.0 round up).

      (ii)  The catch history assignment allocation accrues to the co-op to which the MS/CV-endorsed permit is tied through private agreement, or will be assigned to the non-cooperative fishery if the MS/CV-endorsed permit does not participate in the co-op fishery.

      (iii)  Subject to the regulations at paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, an MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are permanently linked together as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit.

      (iv)  A vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit in a given year shall not engage in processing of Pacific whiting during that year.

      (2) —(i)  An MS/CV-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4). During renewal, all MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners must make a preliminary declaration regarding their intent to participate in the co-op or non-co-op portion of the MS Co-op Program for the following year. MS/CV-endorsed permits not obligated to a permitted MS co-op by March 17 of the fishing year will be assigned to the non-co-op fishery. For an MS/CV-endorsed permit that is not renewed, the following occurs:

      (A) For the first year after the permit is not renewed, the permit will be extinguished, and the catch history assignment from that permit will be assigned to the non-cooperative fishery.

      (B) In the year after the permit is extinguished (the second year after the permit is not renewed), the catch history assignment from that permit will be redistributed proportionally to all valid MS/CV-endorsed permits.

      (ii)  An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (iii)  An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (iv)  As specified at § 660.25(b)(3)(v), each MS/CV endorsement has an associated CHA that is permanently linked as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit. Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration will be registered separately on the limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA cannot be registered to any other person other than the specified owner of the limited entry trawl permit to which it is registered.

      (A)  Multiple MS/CV endorsements and associated CHAs may be registered to a single limited entry trawl permit. If multiple endorsements are registered to a single limited entry trawl permit, the whiting CHA amount (expressed as a percent) will remain in the amount that it was originally issued by NMFS and will not be combined as a single larger CHA, unless two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits are combined for purposes of increasing the size endorsement, as specified at § 660.25(b)(4)(ii)(B). Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration may be disapproved if the person owning the limited entry trawl permit has aggregate CHA amounts in excess of the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

      (B)  NMFS will begin accepting applications for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration beginning September 1, 2014. A request for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be made between September 1 and December 31 of each year. Any transfer of MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA to another limited entry trawl permit must be requested using a Change in Registration of a Mothership/Catcher Vessel Endorsement/Catch History Assignment Application form and the permit owner or an authorized representative of the permit owner must certify that the application is true and correct by signing and dating the form. In addition, the form must be notarized, and the permit owner selling the MS/CV endorsement and its CHA must provide the sale price of the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA. If any assets in addition to the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are included in the sale price, those assets must be itemized and described.

      (C)  Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration from one limited entry trawl permit to another limited entry trawl permit will be effective on January 1 in the year following the application period.

      (D) A limited entry trawl permit owner with multiple MS/CV-endorsements and associated CHA on a single permit may assign each distinct MS/CV endorsement and catch history assignment separately to co-op(s) or the non-cooperative fishery. In such cases, as part of the co-op permit application process, specified at paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the permit owner must specify on the co-op permit application form which MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA is specifically registered to a particular co-op.

      (v)  An MS/CV-endorsed permit may be combined with one or more other limited entry trawl permits; the resulting permit will be a single permit with an increased size endorsement. If the MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit other than a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be MS/CV-endorsed. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be exclusively a C/P-endorsed permit, and will not have an MS/CV endorsement. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another MS/CV-endorsed permit, the combined catch history assignment of the permit(s) will be added to the active permit (the permit remaining after combination) and the other permit will be retired. If a trawl permit has more than one MS/CV endorsements and it is combined with a non C/P-endorsed trawl permit with no such endorsements, the MS/CV endorsements on the resulting permit will be maintained as separate endorsements on the resulting permit. NMFS will not approve a permit combination if it results in a person exceeding the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Any request to combine permits is subject to the provision provided at § 660.25(b), including the combination formula for resulting size endorsements.

      (vi)  If two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits have been combined before January 1, 2012 for purposes of increasing the vessel's size endorsement, a permit owner of the resulting combined permit will have until February 29, 2012 to undo that permit combination. The permit owner must submit a letter to NMFS requesting such action. The letter must be postmarked or hand-delivered to NMFS by the deadline.

      (3) —(i)  No person shall own MS/CV-endorsed permits for which the collective Pacific whiting allocation total is greater than 20 percent of the total mothership sector allocation. For purposes of determining accumulation limits, NMFS requires that permit owners submit a complete trawl ownership interest form for the permit owner as part of annual renewal of an MS/CV-endorsed permit. An ownership interest form will also be required whenever a new permit owner obtains an MS/CV-endorsed permit as part of a request for a change in permit ownership. _Accumulation limits_ will be determined by calculating the percentage of ownership interest a person has in any MS/CV-endorsed permit and the amount of the Pacific whiting catch history assignment given on the permit. Determination of ownership interest will be subject to the individual and collective rule.

      (A)  The Pacific whiting catch history assignment that applies to a person's accumulation limit will include:

      () The catch history assignment on any MS/CV-endorsed permit owned by that person, and

      () That portion of the catch history assignment on any MS/CV-endorsed permit owned by an entity in which that person has an economic or financial interest, where the person's share of interest in that entity will determine the portion of that entity's catch history assignment that counts toward the person's limit.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (C)  Any person that owns a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or renewing an MS/CV endorsement shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the permit greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will not issue an MS/CV endorsement unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits. Further, if SFD discovers through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a person owns or controls more than the accumulation limits, the person will be subject to divestiture provisions specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section.

      (D)  For MS/CV-endorsed permit owners that are found to exceed the accumulation limits during the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, an adjustment period will be provided during which they will have to completely divest of ownership in permits that exceed the accumulation limits. Any person that NMFS determines, as a result of the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, to own in excess of 20 percent of the total catch history assignment in the MS Co-op Program applying the individual and collective rule described at § 660.150(g)(3)(i)(A) will be allowed to receive such permit(s), but must divest themselves of the excess ownership by August 31, 2016. Owners of such permit(s) may receive and use the MS/CV-endorsed permit(s), up to the time their divestiture is completed. After August 31, 2016, any MS/CV-endorsed permits owned by a person (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner named on the permit) in excess of the accumulation limits will not be issued (renewed) until the permit owner complies with the accumulation limits.

      (ii)  No vessel may catch more than 30 percent of the mothership sector's whiting allocation.

      (4)  An appeal to an MS/CV-endorsed permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (5)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge a fee for administrative costs associated with the issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit, as provided at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (6) —(i)  Only a current trawl limited entry permit with a qualifying history of Pacific whiting deliveries in the MS Pacific whiting sector is eligible to receive an MS/CV endorsement. Any past catch history associated with the current limited entry trawl permit accrues to the permit. If a trawl limited entry permit is eligible to receive both a C/P endorsement and an MS/CV endorsement, the permit owner must choose which endorsement to apply for ( the owner of such a permit may not receive both a C/P and an MS/CV endorsement). NMFS will not recognize any other person as permit owner other than the person listed as permit owner in NMFS permit database.

      (ii)  In order to qualify for an MS/CV endorsement, a qualifying trawl-endorsed limited entry permit must have been registered to a vessel or vessels that caught and delivered a cumulative amount of at least 500 mt of Pacific whiting to motherships between 1994 through 2003. The calculation will be based on the following:

      (A) To determine a permit's qualifying catch history, NMFS will use documented deliveries to a mothership in Pacific whiting observer data as recorded in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.

      (B) The qualifying catch history will include any deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships by vessels registered to limited entry trawl-endorsed permits that were subsequently combined to generate the current permit.

      (C) If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will divide the qualifying catch history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.

      (D) History of illegal deliveries will not be included in the qualifying catch history.

      (E) Deliveries made from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program will not be included in the qualifying catch history.

      (F) Deliveries made under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not be included in the qualifying catch history.

      (iii)  A catch history assignment will be specified as a percent on the MS/CV-endorsed permit. The calculation will be based on the following:

      (A) For determination of a permit's catch history, NMFS will use documented deliveries to a mothership in Pacific whiting observer data as recorded in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.

      (B) NMFS will use relative history, which means the catch history of a permit for a year divided by the total fleet history for that year, expressed as a percent. NMFS will calculate relative history for each year in the qualifying period from 1994 through 2003 by dividing the total deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships for the vessel(s) registered to the permit for each year by the sum of the total catch of Pacific whiting delivered to mothership vessel(s) for that year.

      (C) NMFS will select the eight years with the highest relative history of Pacific whiting, unless the applicant requests a different set of eight years during the initial issuance and appeals process, and will add the relative histories for these years to generate the permit's total relative history. NMFS will then divide the permit's total relative history by the sum of all qualifying permits' total relative histories to determine the permit's catch history assignment, expressed as a percent.

      (D) The total relative history will include any deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships by vessels registered to limited entry trawl-endorsed permits that were subsequently combined to generate the current permit.

      (E) If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will split the catch history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.

      (F) History of illegal deliveries will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment or in the calculation of relative history for individual years.

      (G) Deliveries made from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.

      (H) Deliveries made under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.

      (iv)  Persons may apply for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit and its associated catch history assignment in one of two ways: complete and submit a prequalified application received from NMFS, or complete and submit an application package. The completed application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive consideration for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.

      (A)  A “prequalified application” is a partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined the catch history that may qualify the applicant for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail prequalified application packages to the owners of current limited entry trawl permits, as listed in the NMFS permit database at the time applications are mailed, which NMFS determines may qualify for an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail the application by certified mail to the current address of record in the NMFS permit database. The application will contain the basis of NMFS' calculation. The application package will include, but is not limited to: a prequalified application (with landings history), a Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest form, and any other documents NMFS believes are necessary to aid the limited entry permit owner in completing the application.

      (B)  Any owner of a current limited entry trawl permit that does not receive a prequalified application that believes the permit qualifies for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment must complete an application package and submit the completed application to NMFS by the application deadline. Application packages are available on the NMFS Web site () or by contacting SFD. An application must include valid NORPAC data, copies of NMFS observer data forms, or other credible information that substantiates the applicant's qualification for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.

      (v)  If the applicant does not accept NMFS' calculation in the prequalified application either in part or whole, in order for NMFS to reconsider NMFS' calculation, the applicant must identify in writing to NMFS which parts of the application that the applicant contends to be inaccurate, and must provide specific credible information to substantiate any requested corrections. The completed application and specific credible information must be provided to NMFS in writing by the application deadline. Written communication must be either post-marked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. Requests for corrections may only be granted for changes to the selection of the eight years with the highest relative history of whiting and errors in NMFS' use or application of data, including:

      (A) Errors in NMFS' use or application of data from NORPAC;

      (B) Errors in NMFS' calculations;

      (C) Errors in the identification of the permit owner, permit combinations, or vessel registration as listed in the NMFS permit database; and

      (D) Errors in NMFS' use or application of ownership interest information.

      (vi) —(A)  Submission of the complete, certified application includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      () The applicant is required to sign and date the application and have the document notarized by a licensed Notary Public.

      () The applicant must certify that they qualify to own an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.

      () The applicant must indicate they accept NMFS' calculation of initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment provided in the prequalified application, or provide credible information that demonstrates their qualification for an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.

      () The applicant is required to provide a complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as specified at paragraph (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section.

      () Business entities may be required to submit a corporate resolution or other credible documentation as proof that the representative of the entity is authorized to act on behalf of the entity; and

      () NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to make an IAD on initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.

      (B)  A complete, certified application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours to NMFS West Coast Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115, no later than November 1, 2010. NMFS will not accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the application deadline. There are no hardship provisions for this deadline.

      (vii)  NMFS will not review or approve any request for a change in limited entry trawl permit owner at any time after either November 1, 2010 or the date upon which the application is received by NMFS, whichever occurs first, until a final decision is made by the Regional Administrator on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce on that permit.

      (viii)  NMFS will issue an IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the applicant will receive an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit specifying the amounts of catch history assignment for which the applicant has qualified. If NMFS disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons. If known at the time of the IAD, NMFS will indicate if the owner of the MS/CV-endorsed permit has ownership interest in catch history assignments that exceed the accumulation limits and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (ix)  For an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C. For the initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (g)(6)(v) of this section. Items not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of data in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.

      (7)  The fish seller, as defined at § 660.111, is subject to the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.

      (h) —(1)  All vessels registered to the MS/CV-endorsed permits assigned to the _non-cooperative fishery_ will have access to harvest and deliver the aggregate catch history assignment of all MS/CV permits assigned to the non-cooperative fishery.

      (2)  The non-cooperative fishery will be closed by automatic action as specified at § 660.60(d) when the Pacific whiting or non-whiting allocations to the non-cooperative fishery have been reached or are projected to be reached.

      (i)  Catcher vessels participating in the MS Co-op Program may discard minor operational amounts of catch at sea if the observer or EMS has accounted for the discard ( a maximized retention fishery).

      (j) —(1) —(i)  The following observer coverage pertains to certified observers obtained from an observer provider permitted by NMFS.

      (A)  Any vessel registered to an MS permit 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer must carry two certified observers, and any vessel registered to an MS permit shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA must carry one certified observer, each day that the vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport groundfish.

      (B)  Any vessel delivering catch to any MS vessel must carry one certified observer each day that the vessel is used to take groundfish, unless the catcher vessel has a valid EM Authorization and is fishing with EM under § 660.604 of subpart J.

      (C)  Vessels are exempt from the requirement to maintain observer coverage as specified in this paragraph (j) while gear testing as defined at § 660.11. The vessel operator must submit a valid declaration for gear/equipment testing, as required by § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A), and must notify the Observer Program of the gear testing activity at least 48 hours prior to departing on a trip to test gear/equipment.

      (ii) —(A)  The time required for the observer to complete sampling duties must not exceed 12 consecutive hours in each 24-hour period.

      (B)  If an observer is unable to perform their duties for any reason, the vessel is required to be in port within 36 hours of the last haul sampled by the observer.

      (iii)  Any boarding refusal on the part of the observer or vessel must be reported to the Observer Program and OLE by the observer provider. The observer must be available for an interview with the Observer Program or OLE if necessary.

      (2)  An operator and/or crew of a vessel required to carry an observer must provide:

      (i) —(A)  Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those provided for officers, engineers, foremen, deck-bosses or other management level personnel of the vessel.

      (B) —() Accommodations and food for trips less than 24 hours must be equivalent to those provided for the crew.

      () Accommodations and food for trips of _2_4 hours or more must be equivalent to those provided for the crew and must include berthing space, a space that is intended to be used for sleeping and is provided with installed bunks and mattresses. A mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable if a regular bunk is provided to any crew member, unless other arrangements are approved in advance by the Regional Administrator or designee.

      (ii)  MS vessels and catcher vessels must:

      (A) Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for the protection of observers including adherence to all U.S. Coast Guard and other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe operation of the vessel including, but not limited to, rules of the road, vessel stability, emergency drills, emergency equipment, vessel maintenance, vessel general condition, and port bar crossings. An observer may refuse boarding or reboarding a vessel and may request a vessel return to port if operated in an unsafe manner or if unsafe conditions are indentified.

      (B) Have on board a valid Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Decal that certifies compliance with regulations found in 33 CFR chapter I and 46 CFR chapter I, a certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710 or a valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311. Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for the protection of observer(s) including adherence to all USCG and other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe operation of the vessel, and provisions at §§ 600.725 and 600.746 of this chapter.

      (iii)  MS vessels must:

      § 660.160   Catcher/processor (C/P) Co-op Program.

#### § § 660.160

      (a)  The C/P Co-op Program is a limited access program that applies to vessels in the C/P sector of the Pacific whiting at-sea trawl fishery and is a single voluntary co-op. Eligible harvesters and processors must meet the requirements set forth in this section of the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations. In addition to the requirements of this section, the C/P Co-op Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations:

      (1) Pacific whiting seasons § 660.131(b), subpart D.

      (2) Area restrictions specified for midwater trawl gear used to harvest Pacific whiting fishery specified at § 660.131(c), subpart D for GCAs, RCAs, Salmon Conservation Zones, BRAs, and EFHCAs.

      (3) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C: § 660.11 Definitions, § 660.12 Prohibitions, § 660.13 Recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.14 VMS requirements, § 660.15 Equipment requirements, § 660.16 Groundfish Observer Program, § 660.20 Vessel and gear identification, § 660.25 Permits, § 660.55 Allocations, § 660.60 Specifications and management measures, § 660.65 Groundfish harvest specifications, and §§ 660.70 through 660.79 Closed areas.

      (4) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart D: § 660.111 Trawl fishery definitions, § 660.112 Trawl fishery prohibitions, § 660.113 Trawl fishery recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.115 Trawl fishery cost recovery program, § 660.120 Trawl fishery crossover provisions, § 660.130 Trawl fishery management measures, and § 660.131 Pacific whiting fishery management measures.

      (5) The C/P Co-op Program may be restricted or closed as a result of projected overages within the MS Co-op Program, the C/P Co-op Program, or the Shorebased IFQ Program. As determined necessary by the Regional Administrator, area restrictions, season closures, or other measures will be used to prevent the trawl sectors in aggregate or the individual trawl sector (Shorebased IFQ, MS Co-op, or C/P Co-op) from exceeding an ACL, ACT, or formal allocation specified in the PCGFMP or regulation at § 660.55, subpart C, or §§ 660.140, 660.150, or 660.160, subpart D.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  A vessel is eligible to fish as a catcher/processor in the C/P Co-op Program if:

      (A) The vessel is registered to a C/P-endorsed limited entry trawl permit.

      (B) The vessel is not used to harvest fish as a catcher vessel in the mothership co-op program in the same calendar year.

      (ii)  The owner and operator of a catcher/processor vessel must:

      (A)  Maintain a valid declaration as specified at § 660.13(d); maintain records as specified at § 660.113(a); and maintain and submit all records and reports specified at § 660.113(d) including, economic data, scale tests records, cease fishing reports, and cost recovery.

      (B)  As specified at paragraph (g) of this section, procure observer services, maintain the appropriate level of coverage, and meet the vessel responsibilities.

      (C)  The owner and operator of a catcher/processor vessel must:

      () Ensure that all catch is weighed in its round form on a NMFS-approved scale that meets the requirements described in § 660._1_5(b);

      () Provide a NMFS-approved platform scale, belt scale, and test weights that meet the requirements described in § 660.15(b).

      (D)  Collect and remit to NMFS cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115.

      (2) —(i)  For a C/P co-op to participate in the catcher/processor sector of the Pacific whiting fishery, the C/P co-op must:

      (A) Be issued a C/P co-op permit;

      (B) Be composed of all C/P-endorsed limited entry permits and their owners;

      (C) Be formed voluntarily;

      (D) Be a legally recognized entity that represents its members; and

      (E) Designate an individual as a co-op manager.

      (ii)  A C/P co-op is responsible for:

      (A) Applying for and being registered to a C/P co-op permit;

      (B) Organizing and coordinating harvest activities of vessels that fish for the co-op;

      (C) Allocating catch for use by specific co-op members;

      (D) Monitoring harvest activities and enforcing the catch limits of co-op members;

      (E) Submitting an annual report.

      (F) Having a designated co-op manager. The designated co-op manager must:

      () Serve as the contact person with NMFS and the Council;

      () Be responsible for the annual distribution of catch and bycatch allocations among co-op members;

      () Prepare and submit an annual report on behalf of the co-op; and

      () Be authorized to receive or respond to any legal process in which the co-op is involved; and

      () Notify NMFS if the co-op dissolves.

      (iii)  A C/P co-op must comply with the provisions of this section. The C/P co-op, member limited entry permit owners, and owners and operators of vessels registered to member limited entry permits, are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each C/P co-op, member permit owner, and owner and operator of a vessel registered to a co-op member permit may be charged jointly and severally for violations of the provisions of this section. For purposes of enforcement, a C/P co-op is a legal entity that can be subject to NOAA enforcement action for violations of the provisions of this section.

      (c) —(1)  All species other than Pacific whiting are managed with set-asides for the MS and C/P Co-op Programs.

      (i) Species with formal allocations to the C/P Co-op Program: Pacific whiting.

      (ii) Species with set-asides for the MS and C/P Programs, as described in the biennial specifications.

      (2)  The C/P Co-op Program allocation of Pacific whiting is equal to the catcher/processor sector allocation. Only a single co-op may be formed in the catcher/processor sector with the one permitted co-op receiving the catcher/processor sector allocation.

      (i) In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at § 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), allocation for Pacific whiting will be made by the start of the season.

      (ii) In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by the start of the catcher/processor sector primary whiting season specified at § 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(A), NMFS will issue Pacific whiting allocations in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate Pacific whiting based on the C/P Co-op Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of Pacific whiting to the C/P Co-op Program.

      (3) —(i) At-sea sector set-asides of non-whiting groundfish species will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken. Set asides may be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process as necessary.

      (ii) Groundfish species not addressed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken.

      (4)  Annually a specified amount of the Pacific halibut will be held in reserve as a shared set-aside for bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fisheries and the shorebased trawl sector south of 40°10′ N lat.

      (5) [Reserved]

      (6)  When the catcher/processor sector allocation of Pacific whiting is reached or is projected to be reached, further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing by a catcher/processor is prohibited. No additional unprocessed groundfish may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a catcher/processor may continue to process catch that was on board before at-sea processing was prohibited. The catcher/processor sector will close when the allocation of any one species is reached or projected to be reached.

      (7)  The Regional Administrator will announce in the  when the catcher/processor sector allocation of Pacific whiting is reached, or is projected to be reached, and specify the appropriate action. In order to prevent exceeding an allocation and to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of Pacific whiting may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishers and processors, by email, internet, phone, fax, letter, press release, and/or USCG Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the  in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  To be an eligible co-op entity a group of C/P-endorsed permit owners (co-op members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and that represents all of the co-op members.

      (ii)  Each year, the co-op entity must submit a complete application to NMFS for a C/P co-op permit. The application must be submitted to NMFS by between January 17 and March 17 of the year in which it intends to participate. NMFS will not consider any applications received after March 17. A C/P co-op permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it was issued.

      (iii)  The designated co-op manager, on behalf of the co-op entity, must submit a complete application form and include each of the items listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Only complete applications will be considered for issuance of a C/P co-op permit. An application will not be considered complete if any required application fees and annual co-op reports have not been received by NMFS. NMFS may request additional supplemental documentation as necessary to make a determination of whether to approve or disapprove the application. Application forms and instruction are available on the NMFS WCR Web site () or by request from NMFS. The designated co-op manager must sign the application acknowledging the responsibilities of a designated co-op manager defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (A)  Signed copies of the co-op agreement must be submitted to NMFS before the co-op is authorized to engage in fishing activities. A co-op agreement must include all of the information listed in this paragraph to be considered a complete co-op agreement. NMFS will only review complete co-op agreements. A co-op agreement will not be accepted unless it includes all of the required information; the descriptive items listed in this paragraph appear to meet the stated purpose; and information submitted is correct and accurate.

      ()  The co-op agreement must be signed by the co-op members (C/P-endorsed permit owners) and include the following information:

      () A l_i_st of all vessels registered to C/P-endorsed permits that the member permit owners intend to use for fishing under the C/P co-op permit.

      () All C/P-endorsed limited entry member permits identified by permit number.

      () A description of the cooperative's plan to adequately monitor and account for the catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish, and to monitor and account for the catch of prohibited species.

      () A clause stating that if a permit is registered to a new permit owner during the effect_iv_e period of the co-op agreement, any new owners of that member permit would be co-op members and are required to comply with membership restrictions in the co-op agreement.

      () A description of the cooperati_v_e's enforcement and penalty provisions adequate to maintain catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish within the allocations.

      () A description of measures to reduce catch of overfished species.

      () A clause describing how the annual report will be produced to document the cooperative's catch, bycatch data, and any other significant activities undertaken by the co-op during the year, and the submission deadlines for that report.

      () Identification of the designated co-op manager.

      () [Reserved]

      (B) —() If NMFS does not accept the co-op agreement, the co-op permit application will be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons the co-op agreement was not accepted by NMFS.

      () Co-op agreements that are not accepted may be resubmitted for review by sufficiently addressing the deficiencies identified in the NMFS letter and resubmitting the entire co-op permit application by the date specified in the NMFS letter.

      () An accepted co-op agreement that was submitted with the C/P co-op permit application and for which a C/P co-op permit was issued will remain in place through the end of the calendar year. The designated co-op manager must resubmit a complete co-op agreement to NMFS consistent with the co-op agreement contents described in this paragraph if there is a material change to the co-op agreement.

      () Within 7 calendar days following a material change, the designated co-op manager must notify NMFS of the material change. Within 30 calendar days, the designated co-op manger must submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes. NMFS will review the material changes and provide a letter to the co-op manager that either accepts the changes as given or does not accept the revised co-op agreement with a letter stating the reasons that it was not accepted by NMFS. The co-op may resubmit the co-op agreement with further revisions to the material changes responding to NMFS concerns.

      (iv)  A C/P co-op permit will be effective on the date approved by NMFS and will allow fishing from the start of the C/P sector primary whiting season until the end of the calendar year or until one or more of the following events occur, whichever comes first:

      (A) NMFS closes the C/P sector fishing season for the year or the designated co-op manager notifies NMFS that the co-op has completed fishing for the calendar year,

      (B) The C/P co-op has reached its Pacific whiting allocation,

      (C) A material change to the co-op agreement has occurred and the designated co-op manager failed to notify NMFS within 7 calendar days of the material change and submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes within 30 calendar days, or

      (D) NMFS has determined that a co-op failure occurred.

      (2)  For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if the application is disapproved. An approved application will result in issuance of the permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. The IAD for a C/P co-op permit follows the same requirement as specified for limited entry permits at § 660.25(g)(4)(ii), if the applicant does not appeal the IAD within the 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

      (3)  An appeal to a C/P co-op permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of a C/P co-op permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.

      (e) —(1)  Any vessel participating in the C/P sector of the non-tribal primary Pacific whiting fishery-must be registered to a valid limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement—subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at § 660.25(b).

      (i)  A C/P endorsement is not severable from the limited entry trawl permit, and therefore, the endorsement may not be registered to another permit owner or to another vessel separately from the limited entry trawl permit.

      (ii)  A vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed permit cannot operate as a catcher vessel delivering unprocessed Pacific whiting to a mothership processor during the same calendar year it participates in the C/P sector.

      (iii)  A vessel registered to a C/P-endorsed permit may operate as a mothership during the same calendar year it participates in the C/P sector but not on the same trip.

      (iv)  Any person that is applying for or renewing a C/P-endorsed permit shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the permit greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will not issue a C/P-endorsed permit unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed.

      (2) —(i)  A C/P-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4).

      (ii)  A C/P-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (iii)  A C/P-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.

      (iv)  If two or more permits are combined, the resulting permit is one permit with an increased size endorsement. A C/P-endorsed permit that is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit that does not have a C/P endorsement will result in a single trawl limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement with a larger size endorsement.

The Regional Administrator may also make an independent determination of a co-op failure based on factual information collected by or provided to NMFS. NMFS will notify the designated co-op manager in writing in the event the Regional Administrator determines the co-op has failed.

      (3)  Upon determination of a co-op failure, the C/P co-op permit will no longer be in effect.

      (4)  The C/P sector will convert to an IFQ-based fishery beginning the following calendar year after a determination of a co-op failure, or as soon as practicable thereafter. NMFS will develop additional regulations, as necessary to implement an IFQ-based fishery for the C/P sector. Each C/P-endorsed permit will receive an equal amount of QS from the total C/P sector allocation. That QS will not be transferable separate from the C/P-endorsed permit until a determination is made to allow such transfers, necessary regulations are implemented, and public notice is provided. Any use of QP or IBQ pounds associated with C/P endorsed permits is prohibited until the regulations for a C/P sector IFQ system are implemented.

      (5)  C/P Sector accumulation limits will take effect in the event that the C/P co-op fails and converts to an IFQ-based fishery. If an IFQ fishery is implemented, any individual or entity may own or control a maximum of five C/P endorsed permits and QS allocations associated with those permits, as described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. C/P endorsed permit accumulation limits will only take effect after determination of a co-op failure is made and the following administrative process occurs:

      (i)  Upon determination of a co-op failure, a divestiture period will occur starting with the date that co-op failure has been determined and running through the date on which an IFQ program is implemented for the C/P sector or another date specified in the IFQ program implementing regulations. During the divestiture period, an individual or entity may not acquire ownership or control over a total of more than five C/P-endorsed permits. Any entity that already owns or controls more than five C/P-endorsed permits may not acquire additional permits. During the divestiture period any entity who owns or controls C/P-endorsed permits may sell or trade any permits it owns. C/P-endorsed permits may be voluntarily abandoned to NMFS using the procedures provided under paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section.

      (ii)  After conversion to an IFQ fishery and completion of the divestiture period, any person owning or controlling C/P-endorsed permits must be in compliance with accumulation limits, even if that ownership is not reflected in the ownership records available to NMFS as specified at § 660.140(e)(1)(iv). Permit owners found to exceed the five permit accumulation limit for C/P-endorsed permits after the divestiture period are in violation of the accumulation limits and required to completely divest of ownership or control of C/P-endorsed permits that exceed the accumulation limit. C/P-endorsed permits may be voluntarily abandoned to NMFS using the procedures provided under paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section. If NMFS finds that any entity owns or controls more than five C/P-endorsed permits, NMFS will make an Initial Administrative Determination (IAD) that the entity must divest of control or ownership of permits that exceed the accumulation limit within 30 days or NMFS will revoke the excess permits in accordance with § 660.25(h)(2)(ii). The permit owner will have the opportunity to appeal the IAD through the National Appeals Office under the provisions established at 15 CFR part 906. All QS associated with revoked permits will be redistributed to all other C/P-endorsed permit owners in proportion to their QS holdings, based on current ownership records, on or about January 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the permits are revoked. This redistribution process will not allow any entity to receive more than 50 percent of the total QS allocations for the C/P sector.

      (iii)  C/P-endorsed permits owners that own or control more than the five permit accumulation limit may voluntarily abandon C/P-endorsed permits if they notify NMFS in writing during the divestiture period specified at paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section or within 30 days of conversion to an IFQ fishery. The written abandonment request must include the C/P endorsed permit number and the associated QS allocation percentage that will be abandoned. Either the C/P-endorsed permit owner or an authorized representative of the C/P-endorsed permit owner must sign the request. C/P-endorsed permit owners choosing to utilize the abandonment option will permanently relinquish to NMFS any right to the abandoned C/P-endorsed permit, and the QS associated with that permit will be redistributed as described under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section. No compensation will be due for any abandoned permit, or associated QS or QP.

      (iv)  NMFS may request additional information from C/P-permit owners as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits in the event of C/P co-op failure and conversion to IFQ fishery. If NMFS discovers through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a person is not in compliance with accumulation limits, the person will be subject to divestiture provisions specified in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section.

      (v)  For the purpose of determining ownership or control a person or entity has over a C/P endorsed permit, all of the following criteria apply:

      (A) The person or entity has the right to direct, or does direct, in whole or in part, the business of the entity to which the permits are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (B) The person or entity has the right to limit the actions of or replace, or does limit the actions of or replace, the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, any general partner, or any person serving in a management capacity of the entity to which the C/P permits are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (C) With the exception of banks and other financial institutions that rely on permits as collateral for loans as described under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(G) of this section, the person or entity has the right to direct, or does direct, and/or the right to prevent or delay, or does prevent or delay, the transfer of the C/P permit associated QS, or the resulting QP.

      (D) The person or entity, through loan covenants or any other means, has the right to restrict, or does restrict, and/or has a controlling influence over the day to day business activities or management policies of the entity to which the permits are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (E) The person or entity has the right to restrict, or does restrict, any activity related to the C/P permit, associated QS or the resulting QP, including, but not limited to, use of permits, or associated QS, or disposition of fish harvested and processed under the resulting QP, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (F) The person or entity has the right to control, or does control, the management of, or to be a controlling factor in, the entity to which the C/P permit, associated QS, or the resulting QP, are registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

      (G) With the exception of banks and other financial institutions that rely on permits as collateral for loans, the person or entity has the right to cause or prevent, or does cause or prevent, the sale, lease or other disposition of C/P permits, associated QS, or the resulting QP.

      () To qualify for this exception for banks and other financial institutions that rely on permits as collateral for loans, a bank or other financial institution must be regularly or primarily engaged in the business of lending, and must not be engaged in business with, or be controlled by, entities whose primary business is the harvesting, processing, or distribution of fish or fish products.

      () Any state or federally chartered bank or financial institution that meets the requirement of paragraph (h)(5)(v)(G)(1) of this section does not need to submit additional information to NMFS.

      () Any entity that is not a state or federally chartered bank or financial institution must submit a letter requesting the exception and disclose the identity and interest share of any shareholder with a 2 percent or more ownership interest in the lender through submission of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form (see paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section). The lender must make subsequent annual submissions of the letter and Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form to maintain the exception. Letters requesting the exception and complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Forms may be submitted to NMFS, West Coast Region, Permits Office, ATTN: Fisheries Permit Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115. NMFS will only accept complete applications.

      (H) The person or entity has the ability through any means whatsoever to control or have a controlling influence over the entity to which a permit associated QS is registered, with the exception of those activities allowed under paragraphs (h)(5)(v)(C) and (G) of this section.

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 60897, Oct. 1, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

      § 660.210   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 660.210

      This subpart covers the Pacific Coast Groundfish limited entry fixed gear fishery.

      § 660.211   Fixed gear fishery—definitions.

#### § § 660.211

      These definitions are specific to the limited entry fixed gear fisheries covered in this subpart. General groundfish definitions are found at § 660.11, subpart C.

      means a sablefish fishery that occurs both north and south of 36° N. lat. that is subject to trip limit restrictions including daily and/or weekly and/or bimonthly trip limits.

      means the fishery composed of vessels registered to limited entry permits with longline and pot/trap endorsements.

      means, for the limited entry fixed gear sablefish fishery north of 36° N. lat, the fishery where vessels registered to at least one limited entry permit with both a gear endorsement for longline or trap (or pot) gear and a sablefish endorsement fish up to a specified tier limit and when they are not eligible to fish in the DTL fishery.

      means, for the limited entry fixed gear sablefish fishery north of 36° N. lat, the period when vessels registered to at least one limited entry permit with both a gear endorsement for longline or trap (or pot) gear and a sablefish endorsement, are allowed to fish in the sablefish primary fishery described at § 660.231 of this subpart.

      means a specified amount of sablefish that may be harvested by a vessel registered to a limited entry fixed gear permit(s) with a Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or Tier 3 designation; a gear endorsement for longline or trap (or pot) gear; and a sablefish endorsement.

      § 660.212   Fixed gear fishery—prohibitions.

#### § § 660.212

      These prohibitions are specific to the limited entry fixed gear fisheries and to the limited entry trawl fishery Shorebased IFQ Program under gear switching. In addition to the general prohibitions specified in §§ 660.12 and 600.725 of this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to:

      (a)  (1) Possess, deploy, haul, or carry onboard a fishing vessel subject to subparts C and E a set net, trap or pot, longline, or commercial vertical hook-and-line as defined at § 660.11, subpart C, that is not in compliance with the gear restrictions in § 660.230, subpart E, unless such gear is the gear of another vessel that has been retrieved at sea and made inoperable or stowed in a manner not capable of being fished. The disposal at sea of such gear is prohibited by Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973 (Annex V of MARPOL 73/78).

      (2) Take and retain, possess, or land more than a single cumulative limit of a particular species, per vessel, per applicable cumulative limit period, except for sablefish taken in the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary season from a vessel authorized to fish in that season, as described at § 660.231 and except for IFQ species taken in the Shorebased IFQ Program from a vessel authorized under gear switching provisions as described at § 660.140(k).

      (3) Transport fish, if that fish includes any amount of sablefish, away from the point of landing before being sorted and weighed by federal groundfish species or species group, and recorded for submission on an electronic fish ticket under § 660.213(e). (If fish will be transported to a different location for processing, all sorting and weighing to federal groundfish species groups must occur before transporting the fish away from the point of landing).

      (4) Mix fish from more than one landing, where one or more of the landings includes any sablefish, prior to the fish being sorted and weighed for reporting on an electronic fish ticket under § 660.213(e).

      (5) Process, sell, or discard any fish, if that fish includes any amount of sablefish, that has not been accounted for on an electronic fish ticket under § 660.213(e).

      (b)  (1) Fail to comply with all recordkeeping and reporting requirements at § 660.13, subpart C; including failure to submit information, or submission of inaccurate or false information on any report required at § 660.13(d), subpart C, and § 660.213.

      (2) Falsify or fail to make and/or file, retain or make available any and all reports of groundfish landings that include sablefish, containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the regulation at § 660.13, subpart C, or § 660.213.

      (c) (1) Operate a vessel registered to a limited entry permit with a longline, trap (pot), or trawl endorsement and longline and/or trap gear onboard in an applicable GCA (as defined at § 660.230(d)), except for purposes of continuous transiting, with all groundfish longline and/or trap gear stowed in accordance with § 660.212(a) or except as authorized in the groundfish management measures at § 660.230.

      (2) Fish with bottom contact gear (defined at § 660.11) within specific EFHCAs or the DECA, as specified in § 660.12(a).

      (3) Fish inside the Non-Trawl RCA with any gear type other than those specified at § 660.230(b)(6). In addition, a vessel may not carry more than one gear type as specified at § 660.230(b)(6) on board while declared to fish inside the Non-Trawl RCA (see § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A) for valid declarations for use inside the Non-Trawl RCA).

      (d)  (1) Take and retain, possess or land sablefish under the tier limits provided for the limited entry, fixed gear sablefish primary season, described in § 660.231(b)(3), from a vessel that is not registered to a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement.

      (2) Take and retain, possess or land sablefish in the sablefish primary season, described at § 660.231(b), unless the owner of the limited entry permit registered for use with that vessel and authorizing the vessel to fish in the sablefish primary season is on board that vessel. Exceptions to this prohibition are provided at § 660.231(b)(4)(i) and (ii).

      (3) Process sablefish taken at-sea in the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary fishery defined at § 660.231, from a vessel that does not have a sablefish at-sea processing exemption, described at § 660.25(b)(6)(i).

> [75 FR 60897, Oct. 1, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 78427, Dec. 15, 2010; 76 FR 53838, Aug. 30, 2011; 76 FR 74746, Dec. 1, 2011; 81 FR 84430, Nov. 23, 2016; 84 FR 63991, Nov. 19, 2019; 88 FR 83848, Dec. 1, 2023; 89 FR 101522, Dec. 16, 2024]

      § 660.213   Fixed gear fishery—recordkeeping and reporting.

#### § § 660.213

      (a)  General reporting requirements specified at § 660.13 (a) through (c), subpart C, apply to limited entry fixed gear fishery vessels.

      (b)  Declaration reporting requirements for limited entry fixed gear fishery vessels are specified at § 660.13 (d), subpart C.

      (c)  VMS requirements for limited entry fixed gear fishery vessels are specified at § 660.14, subpart C.

      (d)  (1) Any person landing groundfish must retain on board the vessel from which groundfish are landed, and provide to an authorized officer upon request, copies of any and all reports of groundfish landings containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable state law throughout the cumulative limit period during which a landing occurred and for 15 days thereafter. All relevant records used in the preparation of electronic fish ticket reports or corrections to these reports, including dock tickets, must be maintained for a period of not less than three years after the date of landing and must be immediately available upon request for inspection by NMFS or authorized officers or others as specifically authorized by NMFS.

      (2) For participants in the sablefish primary season, the cumulative limit period to which this requirement applies is April 1 through December 31 or, for an individual vessel owner, when the tier limit for the permit(s) registered to the vessel has been reached, whichever is earlier.

      (e)  The first receiver, as defined at § 660.11, subpart C, of fish, if that fish includes any amount of sablefish, from a limited entry fixed gear vessel, is responsible for compliance with all reporting requirements described in this paragraph. Per requirements at § 660.212(a), all fish, if that fish includes any amount of sablefish, must be reported via electronic fish ticket. When used in this paragraph, submit means to transmit final electronic fish ticket information via web-based form or, if a waiver is granted, by paper form. When used in this paragraph, record means the action of documenting electronic fish ticket information in any written format.

      (1)  All first receivers must provide the following types of information: Date of landing, vessel that made the landing, vessel identification number, limited entry permit number(s), name of the vessel operator, gear type used, receiver, actual weights of species landed listed by species or species group including species with no value, condition landed, number of salmon by species, number of Pacific halibut, ex-vessel value of the landing by species, fish caught inside/outside 3 miles or both, and any other information deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator (or designee) as specified on the appropriate electronic fish ticket form.

      (2)  The first receiver must:

      (i) Include, as part of each electronic fish ticket submission, the actual scale weight for each groundfish species as specified by requirements at § 660.15(c), the vessel identification number, and the limited entry permit number. Use and maintain, for the purposes of submitting electronic fish tickets, equipment as specified at § 660.15(d).

      (ii) Submit a completed electronic fish ticket(s) no later than 24 hours after the date of landing, unless a waiver of this requirement has been granted under provisions specified at paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

      (iii) Sablefish from a single landing in the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary fishery may be counted against more than one stacked permit, or against a tier limit(s) and the cumulative trip limit in the DTL fishery. For vessels with stacked limited entry sablefish permits, defined at § 660.12, sablefish may be divided for the purposes of apportioning the sablefish amongst the remaining tier limits associated with each of the stacked permits; in that instance the electronic fish ticket(s) must record all pertinent limited entry permit numbers and apportion sablefish landed against each tier limit. Per regulations at § 660.232(a)(2) a vessel may apportion sablefish catch between the remainder of its tier limit(s) and against the applicable DTL limits; in that instance the electronic fish ticket must be used to apportion sablefish landed against the tier(s) from the sablefish landed against cumulative trip limits of the DTL fishery. If sablefish is apportioned in either of the ways described in this paragraph, the electronic fish ticket must meet the process and submittal requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(iv) and (v) of this section. In addition, the owner-on-board, unless exempted under regulations at § 660.231(a)(4), must review and sign documentation of the landing, as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section.

      (iv) If electronic fish tickets will be submitted prior to processing or transport, follow these process and submittal requirements:

      (A) After completing the landing, the electronic fish ticket information must be recorded immediately.

      (B) Prior to submittal of the electronic fish ticket, the information recorded for the electronic fish ticket must be reviewed by the vessel operator who delivered the fish and the port sampler, if one is present. If required by regulations at § 660.231(a)(4), the owner-on-board must also review the information recorded on the electronic fish ticket prior to submittal.

      (C) After review, the receiver and the vessel operator must sign a printed hard copy of the electronic fish ticket or, if the landing occurs outside of business hours, the original dock ticket. If required by regulations at § 660.231(a)(4), the owner-on-board must also sign a printed copy of the electronic fish ticket or, if the landing occurs outside of business hours, the original dock ticket.

      (D) Prior to submittal, three copies of the signed electronic fish ticket must be produced by the receiver and a copy provided to each of the following:

      () The vessel operator and/or the owner-on-board,

      () The state of origin if required by state regulations, and

      () The first receiver.

      (E) After review and signature, the electronic fish ticket must be submitted within 24 hours after the date of landing, as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (v) If electronic fish tickets will be submitted after transport, follow these process and submittal requirements:

      (A) The vessel name, limited entry permit number, and the electronic fish ticket number must be recorded on each dock ticket related to that landing.

      (B) Upon completion of the dock ticket, but prior to transfer of the landing to another location, the dock ticket information that will be used to complete the electronic fish ticket must be reviewed by the vessel operator who delivered the fish. If the electronic fish ticket will report landings of sablefish in the sablefish primary fishery, the owner-on-board, unless exempted under regulations at § 660.231(a)(4), must review the information recorded on the dock ticket prior to transfer of the landing to another location.

      (C) After review, the first receiver and the vessel operator must sign the original copy of each dock ticket related to that landing. If a dock ticket includes landings of sablefish in the sablefish primary fishery, the owner-on-board, unless exempted under regulations at § 660.231(a)(4), must sign the original copy of that dock ticket.

      (D) Prior to submittal of the electronic fish ticket, three copies of the signed dock ticket must be produced by the first receiver and a copy provided to each of the following:

      () The vessel operator and/or the owner-on-board,

      () The state of origin if required by state regulations, and

      () The first receiver.

      (E) Based on the information contained in the signed dock ticket, the electronic fish ticket must be completed and submitted within 24 hours of the completion of the landing, as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (F) Three copies of the electronic fish ticket must be produced by the first receiver and a copy provided to each of the following:

      () The vessel operator and/or the owner-on-board,

      () The state of origin if required by state regulations, and

      () The first receiver.

      (3)  In the event that a data error is found, electronic fish ticket submissions must be revised by resubmitting the revised form electronically. Electronic fish tickets are to be used for the submission of final data. Preliminary data, including estimates of fish weights or species composition, shall not be submitted on electronic fish tickets.

      (4)  On a case-by-case basis, a temporary written waiver of the requirement to submit electronic fish tickets may be granted by the Assistant Regional Administrator or designee if he/she determines that circumstances beyond the control of a receiver would result in inadequate data submissions using the electronic fish ticket system. The duration of the waiver will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

      (5)  Receivers that have been granted a temporary waiver from the requirement to submit electronic fish tickets must submit on paper the same data as is required on electronic fish tickets within 24 hours of the date received during the period that the waiver is in effect. Paper fish tickets must be sent by facsimile to NMFS, West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, 206-526-6736 or by delivering it in person to 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115. The requirements for submissions of paper tickets in this paragraph are separate from, and in addition to existing state requirements for landing receipts or fish receiving tickets.

      § 660.216   Fixed gear fishery—observer requirements.

#### § § 660.216

      (a) —(1)  When NMFS notifies the owner, operator, permit holder, or the manager of a harvesting vessel of any requirement to carry an observer, the harvesting vessel may not be used to fish for groundfish without carrying an observer.

      (2)  Unless specified otherwise by the Observer Program, any vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer that is engaged in at-sea processing must carry two certified observers procured from a permitted observer provider, and any vessel shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that is engaged in at-sea processing must carry one certified observer procured from a permitted observer provider, each day that the vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport groundfish. Owners of vessels required to carry observers under this paragraph must arrange for observer services from a permitted observer provider except when the Observer Program has determined and given notification that the vessel must carry NMFS staff or an individual authorized by NMFS in addition to or in lieu of an observer provided by a permitted observer provider.

      (b)  At least 24 hours (but not more than 36 hours) before departing on a fishing trip, a harvesting vessel that has been notified by NMFS that it is required to carry an observer, or that is operating in an active sampling unit, must notify NMFS (or its designated agent) of the vessel's intended time of departure.

      (1)  A harvesting vessel that anticipates a delayed departure due to weather or sea conditions may advise NMFS of the anticipated delay when providing the basic notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. If departure is delayed beyond 36 hours from the time the original notice is given, the vessel must provide an additional notice of departure not less than four hours prior to departure, in order to enable NMFS to place an observer.

      (2)  A harvesting vessel that intends to make back-to-back fishing trips ( trips with less than 24 hours between offloading from one trip and beginning another), may provide the basic notice described in paragraph (b) of this section for both trips, prior to making the first trip. A vessel that has given such notice is not required to give additional notice of the second trip.

      (c)  Within 24 hours of ceasing the taking and retaining of groundfish, vessel owners, operators, or managers must notify NMFS or its designated agent that fishing has ceased. This requirement applies to any harvesting and processing vessel that is required to carry an observer, or that is operating in a segment of the fleet that NMFS has identified as an active sampling unit.

      § 660.230   Fixed gear fishery—management measures.

#### § § 660.230

      (a)  Most species taken in limited entry fixed gear (longline and pot/trap) fisheries will be managed with cumulative trip limits (see trip limits in tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) of this subpart), size limits (see § 660.60(h)(5)), seasons (see trip limits in tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) of this subpart and sablefish primary season details in § 660.231), gear restrictions (see paragraph (b) of this section), and closed areas (see paragraph (d) of this section and §§ 660.70 through 660.79). Cowcod, yelloweye, and California quillback rockfish retention is prohibited in all fisheries, and groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception must adhere to GEA restrictions (see paragraph (d)(16) of this section and § 660.70). Regulations governing tier limits for the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary season north of 36° N lat. are found in § 660.231. Vessels not participating in the sablefish primary season are subject to daily or weekly sablefish limits in addition to cumulative limits for each cumulative limit period. Only one sablefish landing per week may be made in excess of the daily trip limit and, if the vessel chooses to make a landing in excess of that daily trip limit, then that is the only sablefish landing permitted for that week. The trip limit for black rockfish caught with hook-and-line gear also applies, see paragraph (e) of this section. The trip limits in tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) of this subpart apply to vessels participating in the limited entry groundfish fixed gear fishery and may not be exceeded.

      (b) —(1) Longline and pot or trap gear are authorized in the limited entry fixed gear fishery, providing the gear is in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this section, and gear marking requirements described in § 660.219 of this subpart.

      (2) Vessels participating in the limited entry fixed gear fishery may also fish with open access gear subject to the gear restrictions at § 660.330(b), subpart F, but will be subject to the most restrictive trip limits for the gear used as specified at § 660.60(h)(7), subpart C.

      (3) Limited entry fixed gear (longline, trap or pot gear) must be attended at least once every 7 days.

      (4) Traps or pots must have biodegradable escape panels constructed with 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the twine deteriorates.

      (5) Vessels fishing with bottom longline and snap gears as defined at § 660.11 are subject to the requirements of the Seabird Avoidance Program described in § 660.21.

      (6) Gear for use in the Nontrawl RCA. Inside the Non-Trawl RCA, only legal non-bottom contact hook-and-line gear configurations may be used for target fishing for groundfish by vessels that participate in the limited entry fixed gear sector as defined at § 660.11. On a fishing trip where any fishing will occur inside the Non-Trawl RCA, only one type of legal non-bottom contact gear may be carried on board, and no other fishing gear of any type may be carried on board or stowed during that trip. The vessel may fish inside and outside the Non-Trawl RCA on the same fishing trip, provided a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d) has been filed with NMFS OLE. Legal non-bottom contact hook-and-line gear means stationary vertical jig gear not anchored to the bottom and groundfish troll gear, subject to the specifications in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i)  The following requirements apply to stationary vertical jig gear:

      (A) Must be a minimum of 30 feet (9 m) between the bottom weight and the lowest fishing hook;

      (B) No more than four vertical mainlines attached to or fished from the vessel ( rod and reel) may be used in the water at one time.

      (C) No more than 100 hooks may be in the water at one time, with no more than 25 extra hooks on board the vessel.

      (ii)  The following requirements apply to groundfish troll gear:

      (A) Must be a minimum of 50 feet (15 m) between the bottom weight and the troll wire's connection to the horizontal mainline;

      (B) No more than one mainline attached to or fished form the vessel may be used in the water at one time;

      (C) No more than 500 hooks may be in the water at one time, with no more than 25 extra hooks on board the vessel;

      (D) Hooks must be spaced apart by a visible maker ( floats, line wraps, colored line splices), with no more than 25 hooks between each marker and no more than 20 markers on the mainline; and

      (E) Natural bait or weighted hooks may not be used nor be on board the vessel. Artificial lures and bait are permitted.

      (c)  (1) In addition to the requirements at § 660.12(a)(8) the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipts.

      (2) For limited entry fixed gear vessels, the following species must be sorted:

      (i) —arrowtooth flounder, big skate, black rockfish, blue/deacon rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, Dover sole, English sole, lingcod, longnose skate, longspine thornyhead, petrale sole, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope rockfish, other fish, other flatfish, Pacific cod, Pacific whiting, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish, sablefish, shortbelly rockfish, shortraker rockfish, shortspine thornyhead, spiny dogfish, starry flounder, widow rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish;

      (ii) —cabezon (California), copper rockfish (California), Oregon cabezon/kelp greenling complex, POP, quillback rockfish (California), Washington cabezon/kelp greenling complex, yellowtail rockfish; and

Boundaries for the Non-Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in the header to Table 2 (North) and Table 2 (South) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (i) It is unlawful to operate a vessel with limited entry non-trawl gear in the Non-Trawl RCA, except for the purpose of continuous transit, or when the use of limited entry non-trawl gear is authorized in this section. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with limited entry non-trawl gear within the Non-Trawl RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section.

      (ii) Limited entry non-trawl vessels may transit through the Non-Trawl RCA, with or without groundfish on board, provided all groundfish non-trawl gear is stowed either: Below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all lines, so that it is rendered unusable for fishing.

      (iii) The Non-Trawl RCA restrictions in this section apply to vessels registered to limited entry fixed gear permits fishing for species other than groundfish with non-trawl gear on trips where groundfish species are retained. Unless otherwise authorized in this section, a vessel may not retain any groundfish taken on a fishing trip for species other than groundfish that occurs within the Non-Trawl RCA. If a vessel fishes in a non-groundfish fishery in the Non-Trawl RCA, it may not participate in any fishing for groundfish on that trip that is prohibited within the Non-Trawl RCA. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the salmon troll fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot on the same trip fish in the sablefish fishery outside of the RCA.]

      (iv) It is lawful to fish within the Non-Trawl RCA with limited entry fixed gear using hook and line gear only when trip limits authorize such fishing, and provided a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d), subpart C, has been filed with NMFS OLE.

      (15)  Commercial fishing for groundfish is prohibited in waters of depths less than 100 fm (183 m) around Cordell Bank, as defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.70, subpart C. An exception to this prohibition is that commercial fishing for “other flatfish” is allowed around Cordell Bank using hook and line gear only.

      (16)  The GEAs are closed areas in the Southern California Bight, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates (specified at § 660.70) where commercial and recreational fishing for groundfish is prohibited. It is unlawful to fish for, take and retain, possess (except for the purpose of continuous transit) or land groundfish within the GEAs. All fishing gear for targeting groundfish must be stowed while transiting through a GEA. If fishing for non-groundfish species within a GEA, then no groundfish may be on board the vessel.

      (e)  The trip limit for black rockfish () for commercial fishing vessels using hook-and-line gear between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Alava (48°09.50′ N. lat.), and between Destruction Island (47°40′ N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point (46°38.17′ N. lat.), is 100 lbs (45 kg) or 30 percent, by weight of all fish on board, whichever is greater, per vessel per fishing trip. These per trip limits apply to limited entry and open access fisheries, in conjunction with the cumulative trip limits and other management measures in § 660.230, subpart E, and § 660.330, subpart F. The crossover provisions in § 660.60(h)(7), subpart C, do not apply to the black rockfish per-trip limits.

      (f)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(v) and (vi).

      (g)  EFHCAs, defined at § 660.11 and with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.75 through 660.79, apply to vessels using bottom contact gear, defined at § 660.11, and includes limited entry fixed gear ( longline and pot/trap,) among other gear types. EFHCAs closed to bottom contact gear are listed at § 660.12(a).

      § 660.231   Limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary fishery.

#### § § 660.231

      This section applies to the sablefish primary fishery for the limited entry fixed gear fishery north of 36° N. lat. Limited entry and open access fixed gear sablefish fishing outside of the sablefish primary season north of 36° N. lat. is governed by management measures imposed under §§ 660.230, 660.232, 660.330 and 660.332.

      (a)  In addition to requirements pertaining to fishing in the limited entry fixed gear fishery (described in subparts C and E), a vessel may not fish in the sablefish primary season for the limited entry fixed gear fishery, unless at least one limited entry permit with both a gear endorsement for longline or trap (or pot) gear and a sablefish endorsement is registered for use with that vessel. Permits with sablefish endorsements are assigned to one of three tiers, as described at § 660.25(b)(3)(iv), subpart C.

      (b) —(1)  North of 36° N lat., the sablefish primary season for the limited entry, fixed gear, sablefish-endorsed vessels begins at 12 noon local time on April 1 and closes at 12 noon local time on December 31, or closes for an individual vessel owner when the tier limit for the sablefish endorsed permit(s) registered to the vessel has been reached, whichever is earlier, unless otherwise announced by the Regional Administrator through the routine management measures process described at § 660.60(c).

      (2)  During the primary season, when fishing against primary season cumulative limits, each vessel authorized to fish in that season under paragraph (a) of this section may fish for sablefish with any of the gear types, except trawl gear, endorsed on at least one of the sablefish endorsed permits registered for use with that vessel.

      (3)  (i) A vessel participating in the primary season will be constrained by the sablefish cumulative limit associated with each of the permits registered for use with that vessel. During the primary season, each vessel authorized to fish in that season under paragraph (a) of this section may take, retain, possess, and land sablefish, up to the cumulative limits for each of the permits registered for use with that vessel ( stacked permits). If multiple limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements are registered for use with a single vessel, that vessel may land up to the total of all cumulative limits announced in this paragraph for the tiers for those permits, except as limited by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Up to three permits may be registered for use with a single vessel during the primary season; thus, a single vessel may not take and retain, possess or land more than three primary season sablefish cumulative limits in any one year. A vessel registered for use with multiple limited entry permits is subject to per vessel limits for species other than sablefish, and to per vessel limits when participating in the daily trip limit fishery for sablefish under § 660.232. In 2025, the following annual limits are in effect: Tier 1 at 246,824 lb (111,957 kg), Tier 2 at 112,193 lb (50,890 kg), and Tier 3 at 64,110 lb (29,080 kg). In 2026 and beyond, the following annual limits are in effect: Tier 1 at 234,312 lb (106,282 kg), Tier 2 at 106,506 lb (48,310 kg), and Tier 3 at 60,860 lb (27,606 kg).

      (ii) If a sablefish endorsed permit is registered to more than one vessel during the primary season in a single year, the second vessel may only take the portion of the cumulative limit for that permit that has not been harvested by the first vessel to which the permit was registered. The combined primary season sablefish landings for all vessels registered to that permit may not exceed the cumulative limit for the tier associated with that permit.

      (iii) A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount of sablefish that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, with no limit on the number of landings or trips.

      (iv) Incidental Pacific halibut retention north of Pt. Chehalis, WA (46°53.30′ N lat.). Pacific halibut may be retained north of Pt Chehalis by vessels participating in the sablefish primary fishery with the requisite Pacific halibut commercial fishery permit. Pacific halibut incidentally caught in the primary sablefish fishery when using bottom longline gear may be retained from April 1 through the Pacific halibut commercial fishing closure date set by the International Pacific Halibut Commission. Vessels permitted as described in this section may possess and land up to 150 lb (68 kg) dressed weight of Pacific halibut for every 1,000 lb (454 kg) dressed weight of sablefish landed, plus two additional Pacific halibut. Pacific halibut retained as described in this section may not be possessed or landed south of Pt. Chehalis.

      (4)  Any person who owns or has ownership interest in a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement, as described at § 660.25(b)(3), subpart C, must be on board the vessel registered for use with that permit at any time that the vessel has sablefish on board the vessel that count toward that permit's cumulative sablefish landing limit. This person must carry government issued photo identification while aboard the vessel. This person must review and sign a printed copy of the electronic fish ticket(s) or dock ticket, as described at § 660.213(d), unless this person qualified for the owner-on-board exemption. A permit owner is qualified for the owner-on-board exemption and not obligated to be on board the vessel registered for use with the sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit during the sablefish primary season if:

      (i) The person, partnership or corporation had ownership interest in a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement prior to November 1, 2000. A person who has ownership interest in a partnership or corporation that owned a sablefish-endorsed permit as of November 1, 2000, but who did not individually own a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit as of November 1, 2000, is not exempt from the owner-on-board requirement when he/she leaves the partnership or corporation and purchases another permit individually. A person, partnership, or corporation that is exempt from the owner-on-board requirement may sell all of their permits, buy another sablefish-endorsed permit within up to a year from the date the last change in permit ownership was approved, and retain their exemption from the owner-on-board requirements. Additionally, a person, partnership, or corporation that qualified for the owner-on-board exemption, but later divested their interest in a permit or permits, may retain rights to an owner-on-board exemption as long as that person, partnership, or corporation purchases another permit by March 2, 2007. A person, partnership or corporation could only purchase a permit if it has not added or changed individuals since November 1, 2000, excluding individuals that have left the partnership or corporation, or that have died.

      (ii) The person who owns or who has ownership interest in a sablefish-endorsed limited entry permit is prevented from being on board a fishing vessel because the person died, is ill, or is injured. The person requesting the exemption must send a letter to NMFS requesting an exemption from the owner-on-board requirements, with appropriate evidence as described at paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. All emergency exemptions for death, injury, or illness will be evaluated by NMFS and a decision will be made in writing to the permit owner within 60 calendar days of receipt of the original exemption request.

      (A) Evidence of death of the permit owner shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a copy of a death certificate. In the interim before the estate is settled, if the deceased permit owner was subject to the owner-on-board requirements, the estate of the deceased permit owner may send a letter to NMFS with a copy of the death certificate, requesting an exemption from the owner-on-board requirements. An exemption due to death of the permit owner will be effective only until such time that the estate of the deceased permit owner has registered the deceased permit owner's permit to a beneficiary or up to three years after the date of death as proven by a death certificate, whichever is earlier. An exemption from the owner-on-board requirements will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the estate of the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during fishing operations.

      (B) Evidence of illness or injury that prevents the permit owner from participating in the fishery shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a letter from a certified medical practitioner. This letter must detail the relevant medical conditions of the permit owner and how those conditions prevent the permit owner from being onboard a fishing vessel during the primary season. An exemption due to injury or illness will be effective only for the fishing year of the request for exemption, and will not be granted for more than three consecutive or total years. NMFS will consider any exemption granted for less than 12 months in a year to count as one year against the 3-year cap. In order to extend an emergency medical exemption for a succeeding year, the permit owner must submit a new request and provide documentation from a certified medical practitioner detailing why the permit owner is still unable to be onboard a fishing vessel. An emergency exemption will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during fishing operations.

      § 660.232   Limited entry daily trip limit (DTL) fishery for sablefish.

#### § § 660.232

      (a)  (1) Before the start of the sablefish primary season, all sablefish landings made by a vessel declared into the limited entry fixed gear fishery and authorized by § 660.231(a) to fish in the sablefish primary season will be subject to the restrictions and limits of the limited entry DTL fishery for sablefish specified in this section and which is governed by routine management measures imposed under § 660.60(c), subpart C.

      (2) Following the start of the primary season, all sablefish landings made by a vessel declared into the limited entry fixed gear fishery and authorized by § 660.231(a) to fish in the primary season will count against the primary season cumulative limit(s) associated with the sablefish-endorsed permit(s) registered for use with that vessel. A vessel that is eligible to fish in the sablefish primary season may fish in the DTL fishery for sablefish once that vessels' primary season sablefish limit(s) have been landed, or after the close of the primary season, whichever occurs earlier (as described at § 660.231(b)(1). If the vessel continues to fish in the limited entry fixed gear fishery for any part of the remaining fishing year, any subsequent sablefish landings by that vessel will be subject to the restrictions and limits of the limited entry DTL fishery for sablefish.

      (3) Vessels registered for use with a limited entry fixed gear permit that does not have a sablefish endorsement may fish in the limited entry DTL fishery, consistent with regulations at § 660.230, for as long as that fishery is open during the fishing year, subject to routine management measures imposed under § 660.60(c), Subpart C. DTL limits for the limited entry fishery north and south of 36° N lat. are provided in tables 2b (North) and 2b (South) of this subpart.

      (b) A vessel that is jointly registered, and has participated or will participate in both the limited entry fixed gear fishery and the Shorebased IFQ Program during the fishing year, is subject to crossover provisions described at § 660.60(h)(7), subpart C.

      (A) After completing the landing, the electronic fish ticket information must be recorded immediately.

      (B) Prior to submittal of the electronic fish ticket, the information recorded for the electronic fish ticket must be reviewed by the vessel operator who delivered the fish and the port sampler, if one is present.

      (C) After review, the receiver and the vessel operator must sign a printed hard copy of the electronic fish ticket or, if the landing occurs outside of business hours, the original dock ticket.

      (D) Prior to submittal, three copies of the signed electronic fish ticket must be produced by the receiver and a copy provided to each of the following:

      () The vessel operator,

      () The state of origin if required by state regulations, and

      () The first receiver.

      (E) After review and signature, the electronic fish ticket must be submitted within 24 hours after the date of landing, as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (iv) If electronic fish tickets will be submitted after transport, follow these process and submittal requirements:

      (A) The vessel name and the electronic fish ticket number must be recorded on each dock ticket related to that landing.

      (C) Upon completion of the dock ticket, but prior to transfer of the offload to another location, the dock ticket information that will be used to complete the electronic fish ticket must be reviewed by the vessel operator who delivered the fish.

      (D) After review, the first receiver and the vessel operator must sign the original copy of each dock ticket related to that landing.

      (E) Prior to submittal of the electronic fish ticket, three copies of the signed dock ticket must be produced by the first receiver and a copy provided to each of the following:

      () The vessel operator,

      () The state of origin if required by state regulations, and

      § 660.316   Open access fishery—observer requirements.

#### § § 660.316

      (a) —(1)  When NMFS notifies the owner, operator, permit holder, or the manager of a harvesting vessel of any requirement to carry an observer, the harvesting vessel may not be used to fish for groundfish without carrying an observer.

      (2)  Unless specified otherwise by the Observer Program, any vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer that is engaged in at-sea processing must carry two certified observers procured from a permitted observer provider, and any vessel shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that is engaged in at-sea processing must carry one certified observer procured from a permitted observer provider, each day that the vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport groundfish. Owners of vessels required to carry observers under this paragraph must arrange for observer services from a permitted observer provider except when the Observer Program has determined and given notification that the vessel must carry NMFS staff or an individual authorized by NMFS in addition to or in lieu of an observer provided by a permitted observer provider.

      (b)  At least 24 hours (but not more than 36 hours) before departing on a fishing trip, a harvesting vessel that has been notified by NMFS that it is required to carry an observer, or that is operating in an active sampling unit, must notify NMFS (or its designated agent) of the vessel's intended time of departure. Notice will be given in a form to be specified by NMFS.

      (1)  A harvesting vessel that anticipates a delayed departure due to weather or sea conditions may advise NMFS of the anticipated delay when providing the basic notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. If departure is delayed beyond 36 hours from the time the original notice is given, the vessel must provide an additional notice of departure not less than four hours prior to departure, in order to enable NMFS to place an observer.

      (2)  A harvesting vessel that intends to make back-to-back fishing trips ( trips with less than 24 hours between offloading from one trip and beginning another), may provide the basic notice described in paragraph (b) of this section for both trips, prior to making the first trip. A vessel that has given such notice is not required to give additional notice of the second trip.

      (c)  Within 24 hours of ceasing the taking and retaining of groundfish, vessel owners, operators, or managers must notify NMFS or its designated agent that fishing has ceased. This requirement applies to any harvesting or processing vessel that is required to carry an observer, or that is operating in a segment of the fleet that NMFS has identified as an active sampling unit.

      (d)  The West Coast Regional Administrator (or designate) may provide written notification to the vessel owner stating that a determination has been made to temporarily waive coverage requirements because of circumstances that are deemed to be beyond the vessel's control.

      (e) —(1)  An operator of a vessel required to carry one or more observer(s) must provide accommodations and food that are Equivalent to those provided to the crew.

      (2)  Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for the protection of observer(s) including adherence to all USCG and other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe operation of the vessel, and provisions at §§ 600.725 and 600.746 of this chapter. Have on board a valid Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Decal that certifies compliance with regulations found in 33 CFR chapter I and 46 CFR chapter I, a certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710 or a valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311.

      (3)  Facilitate observer communications by:

      (i)  Allowing observer(s) to use the vessel's communication equipment and personnel, on request, for the entry, transmission, and receipt of work-related messages, at no cost to the observer(s), observer provider or NMFS.

      (ii)  Ensuring that the vessel's communications equipment, used by observers to enter and transmit data, is fully functional and operational.

      (4)  Allow observer(s) access to, and the use of, the vessel's navigation equipment and personnel, on request, to determine the vessel's position.

      (5)  Allow observer(s) free and unobstructed access to the vessel's bridge, trawl or working decks, holding bins, processing areas, freezer spaces, weight scales, cargo holds, and any other space that may be used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any time.

      (6)  Notify observer(s) at least 15 minutes before fish are brought on board, or fish and fish products are transferred from the vessel, to allow sampling the catch or observing the transfer, unless the observer specifically requests not to be notified.

      (7)  Allow observer(s) to inspect and copy any state or Federal logbook maintained voluntarily or as required by regulation.

      (8)  Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable observer(s) to carry out their duties, including, but not limited to:

      (i) Measuring decks, codends, and holding bins.

      (ii) Providing the observer(s) with a safe work area.

      (iii) Collecting bycatch when requested by the observer(s).

      (iv) Collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by the observer(s).

      (v) Allowing the observer(s) to collect biological data and samples.

      (vi) Providing adequate space for storage of biological samples.

      (f)  This paragraph contains the requirements for observer sampling stations. The vessel owner must provide an observer sampling station that complies with this section so that the observer can carry out required duties.

      (1)  The observer sampling station must be available to the observer at all times.

      (2)  The observer sampling station must be located within four meters of the location from which the observer samples unsorted catch. Unobstructed passage must be provided between the observer sampling station and the location where the observer collects sample catch.

      § 660.330   Open access fishery—management measures.

#### § § 660.330

      (a)  Groundfish species taken in open access fisheries will be managed with cumulative trip limits (see trip limits in tables 3b (North) and 3b (South) of this subpart), size limits (see § 660.60(h)(5)), seasons (see seasons in tables 3a (North) and 3a (South) of this subpart), gear restrictions (see paragraph (b) of this section), and closed areas (see paragraph (d) of this section and §§ 660.70 through 660.79). Unless otherwise specified, a vessel operating in the open access fishery is subject to, and must not exceed, any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit for the open access fishery. Retention of cowcod, yelloweye rockfish, and quillback rockfish off California is prohibited in all fisheries, and groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception must adhere to GEA restrictions (see paragraph (d)(18) of this section and § 660.70). For information on the open access daily/weekly trip limit fishery for sablefish, see § 660.332 and the trip limits in tables 3b (North) and 3b (South) of this subpart. Open access vessels are subject to daily or weekly sablefish limits in addition to cumulative limits for each cumulative limit period. Only one sablefish landing per week may be made in excess of the daily trip limit and, if the vessel chooses to make a landing in excess of that daily trip limit, then that is the only sablefish landing permitted for that week. The trip limit for black rockfish caught with hook-and-line gear also applies (see paragraph (e) of this section).

      (b)  Open access gear includes longline, trap, pot, hook-and-line (fixed or mobile), setnet (anchored gillnet or trammel net, which are permissible south of 38° N. lat. only), spear and non-groundfish trawl gear (trawls used to target non-groundfish species: pink shrimp or ridgeback prawns, and, south of Pt. Arena, CA (38°57.50' N. lat.), California halibut or sea cucumbers). Restrictions for gears used in the open access fisheries are as follows:

      (1)  Non-groundfish trawl gear is generally trawl gear used to target pink shrimp, ridgeback prawn, California halibut and sea cucumber and is exempt from the limited entry trawl gear restrictions at § 660.130(b). The following gear restrictions apply to non-groundfish trawl gear:

      (i) Bottom trawl gear with a footrope diameter greater than 19 inches (48 cm) (including rollers, bobbins, or other material encircling or tied along the length of the footrope) is prohibited anywhere in EFH within the EEZ, as defined by latitude/longitude coordinates at § 660.75. unless such gear is the gear of another vessel that has been retrieved at sea and made inoperable or stowed in a manner not capable of being fished. The disposal at sea of such gear is prohibited by Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973 (Annex V of MARPOL 73/78).

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (2)  (i) Fixed gear (longline, trap or pot, set net and stationary hook-and-line gear, including commercial vertical hook-and-line gear) must be attended at least once every 7 days. Vessels fishing with bottom longline and snap gears as defined at § 660.11 are subject to the requirements of the Seabird Avoidance Program described in § 660.21.

      (ii)  Fishing for groundfish with set nets is prohibited in the fishery management area north of 38°00.00' N. lat.

      (iii)  Traps must have biodegradable escape panels constructed with 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the twine deteriorates.

      (iv)  Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means.

      (3)  Inside the Non-Trawl RCA, only legal non-bottom contact hook-and-line gear configurations may be used for target fishing for groundfish by vessels that participate in the directed open access sector as defined at § 660.11. Vessels must be registered to a valid directed open access permit as defined at § 660.25(i). On a fishing trip where any fishing will occur inside the Non-Trawl RCA, only one type of legal non-bottom contact gear may be carried on board, and no other fishing gear of any type may be carried on board or stowed during that trip. The vessel may fish inside and outside the Non-Trawl RCA on the same fishing trip, provided a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d) has been filed with NMFS OLE. Legal non-bottom contact hook-and-line gear means stationary vertical jig gear not anchored to the bottom, and groundfish troll gear, subject to the specifications in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i)  The following requirements apply to stationary vertical jig gear:

      (A) Must be a minimum of 30 feet (9 m) between the bottom weight and the lowest fishing hook;

      (B) No more than four vertical mainlines attached to or fished from the vessel ( rod & reel) may be used in the water at one time.

      (C) No more than 100 hooks may be in the water at one time, with no more than 25 extra hooks on board the vessel.

      (ii)  The following requirements apply to groundfish troll gear:

      (A) Must be a minimum of 50 feet between the bottom weight and the troll wire's connection to the horizontal mainline;

      (B) No more than one mainline attached to or fished from the vessel may be used in the water at one time;

      (C) No more than 500 hooks may be in the water at one time, with no more than 25 extra hooks on board the vessel;

      (D) Hooks must be spaced apart by a visible maker (e.g., floats, line wraps, colored line splices), with no more than 25 hooks between each marker and no more than 20 markers on the mainline; and

      (E) Natural bait or weighted hooks may not be used nor be on board the vessel. Artificial lures and flies are permitted.

      (c)  (1) In addition to the requirements at § 660.12(a)(8) the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipts.

      (2) For open access vessels, the following species must be sorted:

      (i) —arrowtooth flounder, big skate, black rockfish, blue/deacon rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, Dover sole, English sole, lingcod, longnose skate, longspine thornyhead, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope rockfish, other fish, other flatfish, Pacific cod, Pacific sanddabs, Pacific whiting, petrale sole, shortbelly rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish, sablefish, shortspine thornyhead, spiny dogfish, starry flounder, widow rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish;

      (ii) —cabezon (California), copper rockfish (California), Oregon cabezon/kelp greenling complex, POP, quillback rockfish (California), Washington cabezon/kelp greenling complex, yellowtail rockfish; and

      (iii) —blackgill rockfish, bocaccio, bronzespotted rockfish, cabezon, chilipepper rockfish, copper rockfish, cowcod, minor shallow nearshore rockfish, minor deeper nearshore rockfish, quillback rockfish, splitnose rockfish, and vermilion rockfish.

      (d)  GCAs, a type of closed area, are defined at § 660.11 and with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.70 through 660.74. A vessel that is authorized by this paragraph to fish within a GCA ( fishing for “other flatfish” using hook and line gear only), may not simultaneously have other gear on board the vessel that is unlawful to use for fishing within the GCA. The following GCAs apply to vessels participating in the open access groundfish fishery.

It is unlawful for commercial salmon troll vessels to take and retain, possess, or land fish taken with salmon troll gear within the Salmon Troll YRCA. Open access vessels may transit through the Salmon Troll YRCA with or without fish on board.

      (15)  The Non-Trawl RCA is defined at § 660.11 and with latitude and longitude coordinates, at §§ 660.70 through 660.74 or the EEZ, where fishing for groundfish with non-trawl gear is prohibited. Boundaries for the Non-Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in the header to Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (i) It is unlawful to operate a vessel in the Non-Trawl RCA that has non-trawl gear onboard and is not registered to a limited entry permit on a trip in which the vessel is used to take and retain or possess groundfish in the EEZ, or land groundfish taken in the EEZ, except for the purpose of continuous transiting, or when the use of non-trawl gear is authorized in part 660.

      (ii) On any trip on which a groundfish species is taken with non-trawl open access gear and retained, the open access non-trawl vessel may transit through the Non-Trawl RCA only if all groundfish non-trawl gear is stowed either: Below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all lines, so that it is rendered unusable for fishing.

      (iii) The Non-Trawl RCA restrictions in this section apply to vessels taking and retaining or possessing groundfish in the EEZ, or landing groundfish taken in the EEZ. Unless otherwise authorized by part 660, a vessel may not retain any groundfish taken on a fishing trip for species other than groundfish that occurs within the Non-Trawl RCA. If a vessel fishes in a non-groundfish fishery in the Non-Trawl RCA, it may not participate in any fishing for groundfish on that trip that is prohibited within the Non-Trawl RCA. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the salmon troll fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot on the same trip fish in the sablefish fishery outside of the RCA.]

      (iv) Fishing for “other flatfish” off California (between 42° N lat. south to the U.S./Mexico border) is allowed within the Non-Trawl RCA with hook and line gear only; and provided a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d), has been filed with NMFS OLE.

      (v) Target fishing for groundfish off Oregon and California (between 46°16′ N lat. and the U.S./Mexico border) is allowed within the Non-Trawl RCA for vessels participating in the directed open access sector as defined at § 660.11, subject to the gear restrictions at § 660.330(b)(3)(i-ii), and provided a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d) has been filed with NMFS OLE.

      (16)  The non-groundfish trawl RCAs are closed areas, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates (specified at §§ 660.70 through 660.74, subpart C) designed to approximate specific depth contours, where fishing for groundfish with non-trawl gear is prohibited. Boundaries for the Non-Trawl RCA throughout the year are provided in the open access trip limit tables, Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS in season pursuant to § 660.60(c).

      (i) It is unlawful to operate a vessel in the non-groundfish trawl RCA with non-groundfish trawl gear onboard, except for the purpose of continuous transiting, or when the use of trawl gear is authorized in part 660. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with non-groundfish trawl gear within the Non-Trawl RCA, unless otherwise authorized in part 660.

      (ii) Non-groundfish trawl vessels may transit through the non-groundfish trawl RCA, with or without groundfish on board, provided all non-groundfish trawl gear is stowed either: Below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all towing lines, so that it is rendered unusable for fishing; or remaining on deck uncovered if the trawl doors are hung from their stanchions and the net is disconnected from the doors.

      (iii) The non-groundfish trawl RCA restrictions in this section apply to vessels taking and retaining or possessing groundfish in the EEZ, or landing groundfish taken in the EEZ. Unless otherwise authorized by part 660, it is unlawful for a vessel to retain any groundfish taken on a fishing trip for species other than groundfish that occurs within the non-groundfish trawl RCA. If a vessel fishes in a non-groundfish fishery in the non-groundfish trawl RCA, it may not participate in any fishing on that trip that is prohibited within the non-groundfish trawl RCA. Nothing in these Federal regulations supersedes any state regulations that may prohibit trawling shoreward of the fishery management area (3-200 nm).

      (iv) It is lawful to fish with non-groundfish trawl gear within the non-groundfish trawl RCA only under the following conditions:

      (A) Pink shrimp trawling is permitted in the non-groundfish trawl RCA when a valid declaration report as required at § 660.12(d), subpart C, has been filed with NMFS OLE. Groundfish caught with pink shrimp trawl gear may be retained anywhere in the EEZ and are subject to the limits in Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart.

      (B) When the shoreward line of the trawl RCA is shallower than 100 fm (183 m), vessels using ridgeback prawn trawl gear south of 34°27.00′ N lat. may operate out to the 100 fm (183 m) boundary line specified at § 660.73, when a valid declaration report as required at § 660.13(d), has been filed with NMFS OLE. Groundfish caught with ridgeback prawn trawl gear are subject to the limits in Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart.

      (17)  Commercial fishing for groundfish is prohibited in waters of depths less than 100-fm (183-m) around Cordell Bank, as defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at § 660.70, subpart C. An exception to this prohibition is that commercial fishing for “other flatfish” is allowed around Cordell Bank using hook and line gear only.

      (18)  The GEAs are closed areas in the Southern California Bight, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates (specified at § 660.70) where commercial and recreational fishing for groundfish is prohibited. It is unlawful to fish for, take and retain, possess (except for the purpose of continuous transit) or land groundfish within the GEAs. All fishing gear for targeting groundfish must be stowed while transiting through a GEA. If fishing for non-groundfish species within a GEA, then no groundfish may be on board the vessel.

      (e)  The trip limit for black rockfish () for commercial fishing vessels using hook-and-line gear between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Alava (48°09.50′ N. lat.), and between Destruction Island (47°40′ N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point (46°38.17′ N. lat.), is 100-lbs (45 kg) or 30 percent, by weight of all fish on board, whichever is greater, per vessel per fishing trip. These per trip limits apply to limited entry and open access fisheries, in conjunction with the cumulative trip limits and other management measures in §§ 660.230 and 660.330. The crossover provisions in § 660.60(h)(7), do not apply to the black rockfish per-trip limits.

      (f)  This fishery may be closed through automatic action at § 660.60(d)(1)(v) and (vi).

      (g)  EFHCAs, defined at § 660.11 and with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.75 through 660.79, apply to vessels using bottom trawl gear or bottom contact gear, defined at § 660.11, and includes non-groundfish trawl gear and limited entry fixed gear ( longline and pot/trap,) among other gear types. EFHCAs closed to bottom contact gear are listed at § 660.12(a). EFHCAs closed to bottom trawl gear are listed at § 660.312(d).

      § 660.333   Open access non-groundfish trawl fishery—management measures.

#### § § 660.333

      (a)  This section describes management measures for vessels that take groundfish incidentally with non-groundfish trawl gear, including vessels engaged in fishing for pink shrimp, ridgeback prawns, California halibut, or sea cucumbers.

      (b)  A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl ridgeback prawn fishery if:

      (1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for ridgeback prawn” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit; and

      (2) The landing includes ridgeback prawns taken in accordance with California Fish and Game Code, section 8595, which states: “Prawns or shrimp may be taken for commercial purposes with a trawl net, subject to Article 10 (commencing with Section 8830) of Chapter 3.”

      (c)  A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl California halibut fishery if:

      (1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for California halibut” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit;

      (2) All fishing on the trip takes place south of Pt. Arena, CA (38°57.50′ N. lat.); and

      (3) The landing includes California halibut of a size required by California Fish and Game Code section 8392, which states: “No California halibut may be taken, possessed or sold which measures less than 22 in (56 cm) in total length. Total length means the shortest distance between the tip of the jaw or snout, whichever extends farthest while the mouth is closed, and the tip of the longest lobe of the tail, measured while the halibut is lying flat in natural repose, without resort to any force other than the swinging or fanning of the tail.”

      (d)  A trawl vessel will be considered to be participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl sea cucumber fishery if:

      (1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for sea cucumber” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit;

      (2) All fishing on the trip takes place south of Pt. Arena, CA (38°57.50′ N. lat.); and

      (3) The landing includes sea cucumbers taken in accordance with California Fish and Game Code, section 8405, which requires a permit issued by the State of California.

      (e)  (1) 40° 10′ N lat.-38.00° N lat.: 100 fm to 150 fm during Periods 1 and 6; 100 fm to 150 fm during Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5.

      (2) 38.00° N lat.-34° 27 N lat.: 100 fm to 150 fm

      (3) South of 34° 27 N lat.: 100 fm to 150 fm

      (f)  300 lb (136 kg) per trip. Species-specific limits described in table 3b South also apply and are counted toward the 300 lb (136 kg) groundfish per trip limit. The amount of groundfish landed may not exceed the amount of the target species landed, except that the amount of Pacific spiny dogfish landed may exceed the amount of target species landed. Pacific spiny dogfish are limited by the 300 lb (136 kg)/trip overall groundfish limit. The daily trip limits for sablefish coastwide and thornyheads south of Pt. Conception and the overall groundfish “per trip” limit may not be multiplied by the number of days of the trip. Vessels participating in the California halibut fishery south of 38°57.50′ N lat. are allowed to:

      (1) Land up to 100 lb (45 kg) per day of groundfish without the ratio requirement, provided that at least one California halibut is landed; and

      (2) Land up to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) per month of flatfish, no more than 300 lb (136 kg) of which may be species other than Pacific sanddabs, sand sole, starry flounder, rock sole, curlfin sole, or California scorpionfish (California scorpionfish is also subject to the trip limits and closures in table 3b South).

      (g)  Notwithstanding § 660.60(h)(7), a vessel that takes and retains pink shrimp and also takes and retains groundfish in either the limited entry or another open access fishery during the same applicable cumulative limit period that it takes and retains pink shrimp (which may be 1 month or 2 months, depending on the fishery and the time of year), may retain the larger of the two limits, but only if the limit(s) for each gear or fishery are not exceeded when operating in that fishery or with that gear. The limits are not additive; the vessel may not retain a separate trip limit for each fishery.

      (h)  Effective April 1-October 31: Groundfish: 500 lb (227 kg)/day, multiplied by the number of days of the trip, not to exceed 1,500 lb (680 kg)/trip. The following sublimits also apply and are counted toward the overall 500 lb (227 kg)/day and 1,500 lb (680 kg)/trip groundfish limits: lingcod 300 lb (136 kg)/month (minimum 24-inch (0.61 cm) size limit); sablefish 2,000 lb (907 kg)/month; canary, thornyheads, and yelloweye rockfish are PROHIBITED. All other groundfish species taken are managed under the overall 500 lb (227 kg)/day and 1,500 lb (680 kg)/trip groundfish limits. Landings of these species count toward the per day and per trip groundfish limits and do not have species-specific limits. The amount of groundfish landed may not exceed the amount of pink shrimp landed.

      (i)  Effective April 1-October 31: Groundfish: 500 lb (227 kg)/day, multiplied by the number of days of the trip, not to exceed 1,500 lb (680 kg)/trip.

#### § § 660.334

      (a)  This section includes management measures applicable to vessels that incidentally take and retain groundfish while participating in the West Coast salmon fishery under the regulations at part 660, subpart H (herein referred to as “salmon troll fishery”). All salmon troll vessels that take and retain groundfish species are subject to the open access trip limits, seasons, size limits, and Non-Trawl RCA restrictions listed in tables 3a (North), 3b (North), 3a (South), and 3b (South) to this subpart, unless otherwise stated in this section.

      (b)  (1) In the area north of 40° 10′ N lat., salmon trollers may retain and land up to 500 lb (227 kg) of yellowtail rockfish per month as long as salmon is on board, both within and outside of the Non-Trawl RCA. Salmon trollers may retain and land up to 1 lingcod per 2 Chinook per trip, plus 1 lingcod per trip, up to a trip limit of 10 lingcod, on a trip where any fishing occurs within the Non-Trawl RCA. The lingcod limit only applies during times when lingcod retention is allowed and is not “CLOSED”. These limits are within the limits described in table 3b (North), and not in addition to those limits.

      (2) In the area south of 40° 10′ N lat., salmon trollers may retain and land up to 1 lb (0.45 kg) of yellowtail rockfish for every 2 lb (0.90 kg) of Chinook salmon landed, with a cumulative limit of 200 lb (91 kg)/month, both within and outside of the Non-Trawl RCA. This limit is within the trip limits for shelf rockfish, and not in addition to those limits. All groundfish species are subject to the open access limits, seasons, size limits, and RCA restrictions listed in tables 3a (South) and 3b (South) to this subpart, unless otherwise stated here.

#### § § 660.353

      Recordkeeping and reporting requirements at § 660.13 (a) through (c), subpart C, apply to the recreational fishery.

      § 660.360   Recreational fishery—management measures.

#### § § 660.360

      (a)  Federal recreational groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state recreational groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish. The bag limits include fish taken in both state and Federal waters.

      (b)  The only types of fishing gear authorized for recreational fishing are hook-and-line and spear. Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means. More fishery-specific gear restrictions may be required by state as noted in paragraph (c) of this section (e.g., California's recreational “other flatfish” fishery).

      (1) All vessels participating in the groundfish recreational fishery seaward of California, Oregon, or Washington must carry on board one functional descending device as defined at § 660.351. The descending device must be available for immediate use and be available to present to an enforcement officer upon request.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (c)  Federal recreational groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive State recreational groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish. Off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California, boat limits apply, whereby each fisher aboard a vessel may continue to use angling gear until the combined daily limits of groundfish for all licensed and juvenile anglers aboard has been attained (additional state restrictions on boat limits may apply).

      (1)  For each person engaged in recreational fishing off the coast of Washington, the groundfish bag limit is nine groundfish per day, including rockfish, cabezon, and lingcod. Within the groundfish bag limit, there are sub-limits for rockfish, lingcod, and cabezon outlined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. In addition to the groundfish bag limit of nine, there will be a flatfish limit of five fish, not to be counted towards the groundfish bag limit but in addition to it. The recreational groundfish fishery will open the second Saturday in March through the third Saturday in October for all species. In the Pacific halibut fisheries, retention of groundfish is governed in part by annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the  The following seasons, closed areas, sub-limits, and size limits apply:

      (i) —(A)  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the North Coast Recreational Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area (YRCA). It is unlawful for recreational fishing vessels to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the North Coast Recreational YRCA. A vessel fishing in the North Coast Recreational YRCA may not be in possession of any groundfish. Recreational vessels may transit through the North Coast Recreational YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The North Coast Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

      (B)  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is allowed within the South Coast Recreational YRCA. The South Coast Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

      (C)  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is allowed within the Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA. The Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

      (D)  Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA unless otherwise stated. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA unless otherwise stated. A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For example, if a vessel participates in the recreational salmon fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while in the RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the RCA on the return trip to port.] Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 10-fm (18-m) through 100-fm (183-m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73. The Washington recreational fishing season structure is as follows:

      (ii)  In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing, there is a seven rockfish per day bag limit, including a sub-bag limit of five canary rockfish. Taking and retaining yelloweye rockfish is prohibited in all Marine Areas.

      (iii)  In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing, there is a one cabezon per day bag limit.

      (iv)  In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing and when the recreational season for lingcod is open, there is a bag limit of two lingcod per day. The recreational fishing seasons for lingcod is open from the second Saturday in March through the third Saturday in October.

      (2) —(i) —(A)  Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the Stonewall Bank YRCA. It is unlawful for recreational fishing vessels to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the Stonewall Bank YRCA. A vessel fishing in the Stonewall Bank YRCA may not be in possession of any groundfish. Recreational vessels may transit through the Stonewall Bank YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The Stonewall Bank YRCA, and two possible expansions that are available through inseason adjustment, are defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

      (B)  Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA, a type of closed area or groundfish conservation area, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the recreational RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while within the recreational RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the recreational RCA on the return trip to port.] Off Oregon, from January 1 through December 31, recreational fishing for groundfish is allowed in all depths. Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 10-fm (18-m) through 100-fm (183-m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73.

      (C)  The Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Areas (EFHCAs) are closed areas, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.76 through 660.79, where specified types of fishing are prohibited. Prohibitions applying to specific EFHCAs are found at § 660.12.

      (ii)  Recreational fishing for groundfish is open from January 1 through December 31, subject to the closed areas described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (iii)  For each person engaged in recreational fishing off the coast of Oregon, the following bag limits apply:

      (A)  The bag limit is 10 marine fish per day, which includes rockfish, kelp greenling, cabezon, and other groundfish species; except the daily bag limit in the long-leader gear fishery is 12 fish per day with a sub-bag limit of 5 fish per day for canary rockfish. The bag limit of marine fish excludes Pacific halibut, salmonids, tuna, perch species, sturgeon, sanddabs, flatfish, lingcod, striped bass, hybrid bass, offshore pelagic species, and baitfish ( herring, smelt, anchovies, and sardines). The minimum size for cabezon retained in the Oregon recreational fishery is 16 in (41 cm) total length.

      (B)  There is a three fish limit per day. The minimum size for lingcod retained in the Oregon recreational fishery is 22 in (56 cm) total length. For vessels using long-leader gear (as defined in § 660.351) and fishing inside the Recreational RCA, possession of lingcod is prohibited.

      (C)  There is a 25 fish limit per day for all flatfish, excluding Pacific halibut, but including all soles, flounders, and Pacific sanddabs.

      (D)  There is a 10 fish limit per day.

      (E)  Retention of groundfish is governed in part by annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the  Between the Columbia River and Humbug Mountain, during days open to the “all-depth” sport halibut fisheries, when Pacific halibut are onboard the vessel, no groundfish, except sablefish, Pacific cod, and other species of flatfish (sole, flounder, sanddab), may be taken and retained, possessed or landed, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). “All-depth” season days are established in the annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the  and are announced on the NMFS Pacific halibut hotline, 1-800-662-9825.

      (F) Taking and retaining yelloweye rockfish is prohibited at all times and in all areas.

      (3)  Seaward of California, for groundfish species not specifically mentioned in this paragraph, fishers are subject to the overall 20-fish bag limit for all species of finfish, of which no more than 10 fish of any one species may be taken or possessed by any one person. Petrale sole, Pacific sanddab, and starry flounder are not subject to a bag limit. Recreational spearfishing for all federally-managed groundfish, is exempt from closed areas and seasons, consistent with Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. This exemption applies only to recreational vessels and divers provided no other fishing gear, except spearfishing gear, is on board the vessel. California state law may provide regulations similar to Federal regulations for kelp greenlings. Retention of cowcod, yelloweye rockfish, quillback rockfish, and bronzespotted rockfish, is prohibited in the recreational fishery seaward of California all year in all areas. Retention of species or species groups for which the season is closed is prohibited in the recreational fishery seaward of California all year in all areas, unless otherwise authorized in this section. For each person engaged in recreational fishing in the EEZ seaward of California, the following closed areas, seasons, bag limits, and size limits apply:

      (i)  A Groundfish Conservation Area (GCA), a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees latitude and longitude. The following GCAs apply to participants in California's recreational fishery.

      (A)  The Recreational RCAs are areas that are closed to recreational fishing for certain groundfish. Fishing for the California rockfish, cabezon, greenling complex (RCG Complex), as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and lingcod with recreational gear, is prohibited within the Recreational RCA. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land the RCG Complex and lingcod taken with recreational gear within the Recreational RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section. A vessel fishing in the Recreational RCA may not be in possession of any species prohibited by the restrictions that apply within the Recreational RCA. For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the Recreational RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of the RCG Complex and lingcod while in the Recreational RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain rockfish shoreward of the Recreational RCA on the return trip to port. If the season is closed for a species or species group, fishing for that species or species group is prohibited both within the Recreational RCA and outside of the Recreational RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section. In times and areas where a Recreational RCA is closed shoreward of a Recreational RCA line ( when an “off-shore only” fishery is active in that management area) vessels may stop, anchor in, or transit through waters shoreward of the Recreational RCA line so long as they do not have any hook-and-line fishing gear in the water. Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 30 fm (55 m) through 100 fm (183 m) depth contours can be found at §§ 660.71 through 660.73.

      § 660.402   Definitions.

#### § § 660.402

      In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in § 600.10 of this chapter, the terms used in this subpart have the following meanings:

      means a hook with a single shank and point, with no secondary point or barb curving or projecting in any other direction. Where barbless hooks are specified, hooks manufactured with barbs can be made barbless by forcing the point of the barb flat against the main part of the point.

      means fishing with troll fishing gear as defined annually under § 660.408, or fishing for the purpose of sale or barter of the catch.

      means the Pacific Fishery Management _Council_.

      means the shortest distance between the midpoint of the clavicle arch and the fork of the tail, measured along the lateral line while the fish is lying on its side, without resort to any force or mutilation of the fish other than removal of the head, gills, and entrails.

      means salmon that have been beheaded, gilled, and gutted without further separation of vertebrae, and are either being prepared for on-board freezing, or are frozen and will remain frozen until landed.

      means the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, bounded on the north by the Provisional International Boundary between the United States and Canada, and bounded on the south by the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico. The northeastern, northern, and northwestern boundaries of the fishery management area are as follows:

      (1) Northeastern boundary—that part of a line connecting the light on Tatoosh Island, WA, with the light on Bonilla Point on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, southerly of the International Boundary between the United States and Canada (at 48°29′37″ N. lat., 124°43′33″ W. long.), and northerly of the point where that line intersects with the boundary of the U.S. territorial sea.

      (2) Northern and northwestern boundary is a line   connecting the following coordinates:

      (3) The southern boundary of the fishery management area is the U.S.-Mexico International Boundary, which is a line connecting the following coordinates:

      (4) The inner boundaries of the fishery management area are subject to change if the Secretary assumes responsibility for the regulation of the salmon fishery within state waters under section 306(b) of the Magnuson Act.

      means a fishing vessel, equipped with troll fishing gear, that has a present capability for:

      (1) On board freezing of the catch.

      (2) Storage of the fish in a frozen condition until they are landed.

      or  means to begin transfer of fish from a fishing vessel. Once transfer begins, all fish onboard the vessel are counted as part of the _landing_.

      means the Fishery Management Plan, as amended, for commercial and recreational ocean salmon fisheries in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (3 to 200 nautical miles offshore) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The Salmon FMP was first developed by the Council and approved by the Secretary in 1978. The Salmon FMP was amended on October 31, 1984, to establish a framework process to develop and implement fishery management actions; the Salmon FMP has been subsequently amended at irregular intervals. Other names commonly used include: Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan, West Coast Salmon Plan, West Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan.

      means artificial fishing lures made of wood or hard plastic with one or more hooks attached. Lures commonly known as “spoons,” “wobblers,” “dodgers,” and flexible plastic lures are not considered plugs, and may not be used where “plugs only” are specified.

      means fishing with recreational fishing gear as defined annually under § 660.408 and not for the purpose of sale or barter.

      will be defined annually under § 660.408.

      § 660.407   Treaty Indian fishing.

#### § § 660.407

      Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, treaty Indian fishing in any part of the fishery management area is subject to the provisions of this subpart, the Magnuson Act, and any other regulations issued under the Magnuson Act.

      § 660.408   Annual actions.

#### § § 660.408

      (a)  NMFS will annually establish specifications and management measures or, as necessary, adjust specifications and management measures for the commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fisheries by publishing the action in the  under § 660.411. Management of the Pacific Coast salmon fishery will be conducted consistent with the standards and procedures in the Salmon FMP. The Salmon FMP is available from the Regional Administrator or the Council. Specifications and management measures are described in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section.

      (b)  Annual Specifications will include annual catch limits (ACLs) determined consistent with the standards and procedures in the Salmon FMP.

      (c)  Allowable ocean harvest levels must ensure that conservation objectives and ACLs are met, as described in § 660.410, except that where the  fishing control rules described in § 660.410(c) apply, conservation objectives may not be met, provided ACLs are met. The allowable ocean harvest for commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be expressed in terms of season regulations expected to achieve a certain optimum harvest level or in terms of a particular number of fish. Procedures for determining allowable ocean harvest vary by species and fishery complexity, and are documented in the fishery management plan and Council documents.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  Initial allocation of coho and chinook salmon north of Cape Falcon, OR, will be based on the following schedule:

      (ii)  The initial allocation may be modified annually in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) through (viii) of this section. These deviations from the allocation schedule provide flexibility to account for the dynamic nature of the fisheries and better achieve the allocation objectives and fishery allocation priorities in paragraphs (d)(1)(ix) and (x) of this section. Total allowable ocean harvest will be maximized to the extent possible consistent with treaty obligations, state fishery needs, conservation objectives, and ACLs. Every effort will be made to establish seasons and gear requirements that provide troll and recreational fleets a reasonable opportunity to catch the available harvest. These may include single-species directed fisheries with landing restrictions for other species.

      (iii)  Preseason species trades (chinook and coho) may be made if they are based upon the recommendation of the commercial and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon; simultaneously benefit both the commercial and recreational fisheries or benefit one fishery without harming the other; and are supported by a socio-economic analysis that compares the impacts of the recommendation to those of the standard allocation schedule to determine the allocation that best meets the allocation objectives. This analysis will be made available to the public during the preseason process for establishing annual management measures. Preseason trades will use an exchange ratio of four coho to one chinook as a desirable guideline.

      (iv)  The commercial allowable ocean harvest of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation process may be varied by major subareas (, north of Leadbetter Point and south of Leadbetter Point) if there is need to do so to decrease impacts on weak stocks. Deviations in each major subarea will generally not exceed 50 percent of the allowable ocean harvest of each species that would have been established without a geographic deviation in the distribution of the allowable ocean harvest. Deviation of more than 50 percent will be based on a conservation need to protect the weak stocks and will provide larger overall harvest for the entire fishery north of Cape Falcon than would have been possible without the deviation.

      (v)  The recreational allowable ocean harvest of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation process will be distributed among the four major recreational subareas as described in the coho and chinook distribution sections below. The Council may deviate from subarea quotas to meet recreational season objectives, based on agreement of representatives of the affected ports and/or in accordance with section 6.5.3.2 of the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan, regarding certain selective fisheries. Additionally, based upon the recommendation of the recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon, the Council will include criteria in its preseason salmon management recommendations to guide any inseason transfer of coho among the recreational subareas to meet recreational season duration objectives.

      (A)  The preseason recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho north of Cape Falcon will be distributed to provide 50 percent to the area north of Leadbetter Point and 50 percent to the area south of Leadbetter Point. In years with no fishery in Washington State management area 4B, the distribution of coho north of Leadbetter Point will be divided to provide 74 percent to the subarea between Leadbetter Point and the Queets River (Westport), 5.2 percent to the subarea between Queets River and Cape Flattery (La Push), and 20.8 percent to the area north of the Queets River (Neah Bay). In years when there is an Area 4B (Neah Bay) fishery under state management, 25 percent of the numerical value of that fishery shall be added to the recreational allowable ocean harvest north of Leadbetter Point prior to applying the sharing percentages for Westport and La Push. The increase to Westport and La Push will be subtracted from the Neah Bay ocean share to maintain the same total harvest allocation north of Leadbetter Point. Each of the four recreational port area allocations will be rounded, to the nearest hundred fish, with the largest quotas rounded downward, if necessary, to sum to the preseason recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho north of Cape Falcon.

      (B)  Subarea distributions of Chinook will be managed as guidelines based on calculations of the Salmon Technical Team with the primary objective of achieving all-species fisheries without imposing Chinook restrictions ( area closures or bag limit reductions). Chinook in excess of all-species fisheries needs may be utilized by directed Chinook fisheries north of Cape Falcon or by negotiating a preseason species trade of Chinook and coho between commercial and recreational allocations in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

      (vi)  Inseason transfers, including species trades of Chinook and coho, may be permitted in either direction between commercial and recreational fishery quotas to allow for uncatchable fish in one fishery to be reallocated to the other. Fish will be deemed uncatchable by a respective commercial or recreational fishery only after considering all possible annual management actions to allow for their harvest that are consistent with the harvest management objectives specific in the fishery management plan including consideration of single species fisheries. Implementation of inseason transfers will require consultation with the pertinent commercial and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives from the area involved and the Salmon Technical Team, and a clear establishment of available fish and impacts from the transfer. Inseason trades or transfers may vary from the guideline ratio of four coho to one Chinook to meet the allocation objectives in paragraph (d)(1)(ix) of this section.

      (vii)  Any increase or decrease in the recreational or commercial allowable ocean harvest resulting from an inseason restructuring of a fishery or other inseason management action does not require reallocation of the overall non-treaty allowable ocean harvest north of Cape Falcon between the recreational and commercial fisheries. Inseason redistribution of subarea quotas within the recreational fishery or the distribution of allowable coho catch transfers from the commercial fishery among subareas may deviate from the preseason distribution. Inseason management actions may be taken by the Regional Administrator to assure meeting the primary objective of achieving all-species fisheries without imposing Chinook restrictions in each of the recreational subareas north of Cape Falcon. Such actions might include, but are not limited to: Closure from 0 to 3, 0 to 6, 3 to 200, or 5 to 200 nm from shore; closure from a point extending due west from Tatoosh Island for 5 nm, then south to a point due west of Umatilla Reef Buoy, then due east to shore; closure from North Head at the Columbia River mouth north to Leadbetter Point; change in species that may be landed; or other actions as prescribed in the annual management measures.

      (viii)  Deviations from the initial gear and port area allocations may be allowed to implement selective fisheries for marked salmon stocks as long as the deviations are within the constraints and process specified in section 6.5.3.2 of the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan.

      (ix)  The goal of allocating ocean harvest north of Cape Falcon is to achieve, to the greatest degree possible, the following objectives for the commercial and recreational fisheries. When deviation from the allocation schedule is being considered, these objectives will serve as criteria to help determine whether a user group will benefit from the deviation.

      (A) Provide recreational opportunity by maximizing the duration of the fishing season while minimizing daily and area closures and restrictions on gear and daily limits.

      (B) Maximize the value of the commercial harvest while providing fisheries of reasonable duration.

      (x)  The following fishery allocation priorities will provide guidance in the preseason process of establishing final harvest allocations and structuring seasons that best achieve the allocation objectives. To the extent fish are provided to each fishery by the allocation schedule, these priorities do not favor one user group over the other and should be met simultaneously for each fishery. Seasons may be structured that deviate from these priorities consistent with the allocation objectives.

      (A) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, provide coho for a late June through early September all-species season; provide chinook to allow access to coho and, if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to the all-species season; and adjust days per week and/or institute area restrictions to stabilize season duration. For the commercial fishery, provide chinook for a May and early June chinook season and provide coho for hooking mortality and/or access to a pink fishery, and ensure that part of the chinook season will occur after June 1.

      (B) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000 coho and above 100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, relax any restrictions in the all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species season beyond Labor Day as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Day through late June chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to ensure continuity with the all-species season. For the commercial fishery, provide coho for an all-species season in late summer and/or access to a pink fishery; and leave adequate chinook from the May through June season to allow access to coho.

      (2) —(i)  Preseason allocation shares of coho salmon south of Cape Falcon, OR, will be determined by an allocation schedule, which is based on the following formula. The formula will be used to interpolate between allowable harvest levels as shown in the table below.

      (A) Up to 350,000 allowable ocean harvest: The first 150,000 fish will be allocated to the recreational fishery. Additional fish will be allocated 66.7 percent to troll and 33.3 percent to recreational. The incidental coho mortality for a commercial all-salmon-except-coho fishery will be deducted from the troll allocation. If the troll allocation is insufficient for this purpose, the remaining number of coho needed for this estimated incidental coho mortality will be deducted from the recreational share.

      (B) From 350,000 to 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The recreational allocation is equal to 14 percent of the allowable harvest above 350,000 fish, plus 217,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable ocean harvest will be allocated to the troll fishery.

      (C) Above 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The recreational allocation is equal to 10 percent of the allowable harvest above 800,000 fish, plus 280,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable ocean harvest will be allocated to the troll fishery.

      (ii)  Allowable harvest south of Cape Falcon may be divided and portions assigned to subareas based on considerations including, but not limited to, controlling ocean harvest impacts on depressed, viable natural stocks within acceptable maximum allowable levels; stock abundance; allocation considerations; stock specific impacts; relative abundance of the salmon species in the fishery; escapement goals; and maximizing harvest potential.

      (iii)  When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70 percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation. The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.

      (iv)  The allocation provisions in paragraph (d)(2) of this section provide guidance only when coho abundance permits a directed coho harvest, not when the allowable harvest impacts are insufficient to allow coho retention south of Cape Falcon. At such low levels, allowable harvest impacts will be allocated during the Council's preseason process.

      (v)  No later than August 15 each year, the Salmon Technical Team will estimate the number of coho salmon needed to complete the recreational seasons. Any coho salmon allocated to the recreational fishery that are not needed to complete the recreational seasons will be reallocated to the commercial fishery. Once reallocation has taken place, the remaining recreational quota will change to a harvest guideline. If the harvest guideline for the recreational fishery is projected to be reached on or before Labor Day, the Regional Administrator may allow the recreational fishery to continue through the Labor Day weekend only if there is no significant danger of impacting the allocation of another fishery or of failing to meet an escapement goal.

      (e)  Management boundaries and zones will be established or adjusted to achieve a conservation purpose or management objective. A conservation purpose or management objective protects a fish stock, simplifies management of a fishery, or promotes wise use of fishery resources by, for example, separating fish stocks, facilitating enforcement, separating conflicting fishing activities, or facilitating harvest opportunities. Management boundaries and zones will be described by geographical references, coordinates (latitude and longitude), depth contours, distance from shore, or similar criteria.

      (f)  The minimum harvest lengths for commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be changed upon demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, an increase in minimum size for commercially caught salmon may be necessary for conservation or may provide a greater poundage and monetary yield from the fishery while not substantially increasing hooking mortality. The removal of a minimum size for the recreational fishery may prevent wastage of fish and outweigh the detrimental impacts of harvesting immature fish.

      (g)  Recreational daily bag limits for each fishing area will specify number and species of salmon that may be retained. The recreational daily bag limits for each fishing area will be set to maximize the length of the fishing season consistent with the allowable level of harvest in the area.

      (h)  Gear restrictions for commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified upon demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, gear restrictions may be imposed or modified to facilitate enforcement, reduce hooking mortality, or reduce gear expenses for fishermen.

      (i) —(1)  _Seasons_ for commercial and recreational fishing will be established or modified taking into account allowable ocean harvest levels and quotas, allocations between the commercial and recreational fisheries, and the estimated amount of effort required to catch the available fish based on past seasons.

      (2)  Commercial seasons will be established or modified taking into account wastage of fish that cannot legally be retained, size and poundage of fish caught, effort shifts between fishing areas, and protection of depressed stocks present in the fishing areas. All-species seasons will be established to allow the maximum allowable harvest of pink salmon, when and where available, without exceeding allowable Chinook or coho harvest levels and within conservation and allocation constraints of the pink stocks.

      (3)  If feasible, recreational seasons will be established or modified to encompass Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends, and to avoid the need for inseason closures.

      (j)  (by species, including fish caught 0-3 nm seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California). _Quotas_ for commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified to ensure that allowable ocean harvests are not exceeded. Quotas may be fixed or adjustable and used in conjunction with seasons. Any quota established does not represent a guaranteed ocean harvest, but a maximum ceiling on catch.

      (k) —(1)  In addition to the all-species seasons and the all-species-except-coho seasons established for the commercial and recreational fisheries, species selective fisheries and mark selective fisheries may be established.

      (2)  Selective coho-only, Chinook-only, pink-only, all salmon except Chinook, and all salmon except coho fisheries may be established if harvestable fish of the target species are available; harvest of incidental species will not exceed allowable levels; proven, documented selective gear exists; significant wastage of incidental species will not occur; and the selective fishery will occur in an acceptable time and area where wastage can be minimized and target stocks are primarily available.

      (3)  Fisheries that select for salmon marked with a healed adipose fin clip may be established in the annual management measures as long as they are consistent with guidelines in section 6.5.3.1 of the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan.

      (l)  (1) NMFS will establish or modify treaty Indian fishing seasons and/or fixed or adjustable quotas, size limits, gear restrictions, and/or area restrictions taking into account recommendations of the Council, proposals from affected tribes, and relevant Federal court proceedings.

      (2) The combined treaty Indian fishing seasons will not be longer than necessary to harvest the allowable treaty Indian catch, which is the total treaty harvest that would occur if the tribes chose to take their total entitlement of the weakest stock in the fishery management area, assuming this level of harvest did not create conservation or allocation problems for other stocks.

      (3) Any fixed or adjustable quotas established will be consistent with established treaty rights and will not exceed the harvest that would occur if the entire treaty entitlement to the weakest run were taken by treaty Indian fisheries in the fishery management area.

      (4) If adjustable quotas are established for treaty Indian fishing, they may be subject to inseason adjustment because of unanticipated Chinook or coho hooking mortality occurring during the season, catches in treaty Indian fisheries inconsistent with those unanticipated under Federal regulations, or a need to redistribute quotas to ensure attainment of an overall quota.

      (m)  For purposes of section 303 of the Magnuson Act, the federally reserved fishing rights of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Indian Tribes as set out in a legal opinion   dated October 4, 1993, by the Office of the Solicitor, Department of the Interior, are applicable law. Under section 303 of the Magnuson Act, allowable ocean harvest must be consistent with all applicable laws.

      (n)  Telephone hotlines and USCG broadcasts will provide actual notice of inseason actions for commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing.

      (o)  Reporting requirements for commercial fishing may be imposed to ensure timely and accurate assessment of catches in regulatory areas subject to quota management. Such reports are subject to the limitations described herein. Persons engaged in commercial fishing in a regulatory area subject to quota management and landing their catch in another regulatory area open to fishing may be required to transmit a brief report prior to leaving the first regulatory area. The regulatory areas subject to these reporting requirements, the contents of the reports, and the entities receiving the reports will be specified annually.

      § 660.409   Inseason actions.

#### § § 660.409

      (a)  NMFS is authorized to take the following inseason management actions annually, as appropriate.

      (1)  When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the Regional Administrator to be reached on or by a certain date, NMFS will, by an inseason action issued under § 660.411, close the commercial or recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion of the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to be reached.

      (2)  If a fishery is closed under a quota before the end of a scheduled season based on overestimate of actual catch, NMFS will reopen that fishery in as timely a manner as possible for all or part of the remaining original season provided NMFS finds that a reopening of the fishery is consistent with the management objectives for the affected species and the additional open period is no less than 24 hours. The season will be reopened by an inseason action issued under § 660.411.

      (3)  NMFS may, by an inseason action issued under § 660.411, make appropriate changes in relevant seasons or quotas if a significant computational error or errors made in calculating preseason estimates of salmon abundance are identified, provided that such correction can be made in a timely manner to affect the involved fishery without disrupting the capacity to meet the objectives of the fishery management plan.

      (b)  (1) The Regional Administrator will consult with the Chairman of the Council and the appropriate State Directors prior to taking any of the following flexible inseason management provisions, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (i) Modification of quotas and/or fishing seasons.

      (ii) Modification of the species that may be caught and landed during specific seasons and the establishment or modification of limited retention regulations.

      (iii) Modification of recreational bag limits and recreational fishing days per calendar week.

      (iv) Establishment or modification of gear restrictions.

      (v) Modification of boundaries, including landing boundaries, and establishment of closed areas.

      (2) Fishery managers must determine that any inseason adjustment in management measures is consistent with fishery regimes established by the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, conservation objectives and ACLs, conservation of the salmon resource, any adjudicated Indian fishing rights, and the ocean allocation scheme in the fishery management plan. All inseason adjustments will be based on consideration of the following factors:

      (i) Predicted sizes of salmon runs.

      (ii) Harvest quotas and hooking mortality limits for the area and total allowable impact limitations, if applicable.

      (iii) Amount of commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian catch for each species in the area to date.

      (iv) Amount of commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing effort in the area to date.

      (v) Estimated average daily catch per fisherman.

      (vi) Predicted fishing effort for the area to the end of the scheduled season.

      (vii) Other factors, as appropriate.

      § 660.410   Conservation objectives, ACLs, and de minimis control rules.

#### § § 660.410

      (a)  Annual management measures will be consistent with conservation objectives described in Table 3-1 of the Salmon FMP or as modified through the processes described below, except where the ACL escapement level for a stock is higher than the conservation objective, in which case annual management measures will be designed to ensure that the ACL for that stock is met, or where the de minimis control rules described in paragraph (c) of this section apply.

      (1)  NMFS is authorized, through an action issued under § 660.411, to modify a conservation objective if—

      (i) A comprehensive technical review of the best scientific information available provides conclusive evidence that, in the view of the Council, the Scientific and Statistical Committee, and the Salmon Technical Team, justifies modification of a conservation objective or

      (ii) Action by a Federal court indicates that modification of a conservation objective is appropriate.

      (2)  The annual specifications and management measures will be consistent with NMFS consultation standards or NMFS recovery plans for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Where these standards differ from those described in FMP Table 3-1, NMFS will describe the ESA-related standards for the upcoming annual specifications and management measures in a letter to the Council prior to the first Council meeting at which the development of those annual management measures occurs.

      (b)  Annual management measures will be designed to ensure escapement levels at or higher than ACLs determined through the procedures set forth in the FMP.

      (c)  Klamath River fall Chinook (KRFC) and Sacramento River fall Chinook salmon have the same form of  control rule described in the Salmon FMP, which allows for limited fishing impacts when abundance falls below S (the abundance of adult spawners that is expected, on average, to produce *MSY*). The control rule describes maximum allowable exploitation rates at any given level of abundance. The annual management measures may provide for lower exploitation rates as needed to address uncertainties or other year-specific circumstances. The  exploitation rate in a given year must also be determined in consideration of the following factors:

      (1) The potential for critically low natural spawner abundance, including considerations for substocks that may fall below crucial genetic thresholds;

      (2) Spawner abundance levels in recent years;

      (3) The status of co-mingled stocks;

      (4) Indicators of marine and freshwater environmental conditions;

      (5) Minimal needs for Tribal fisheries;

      (6) Whether the stock is currently in an approaching overfished condition;

      (7) Whether the stock is currently overfished;

      (8) Other considerations, as appropriate; and

      (9) Exploitation rates, including  exploitation rates, must not jeopardize the long-term capacity of the stock to produce maximum sustained yield on a continuing basis. NMFS expects that the control rule and associated criteria will result in decreasing harvest opportunity as abundance declines and little or no opportunity for harvest at abundance levels less than half of the maximum stock size threshold (MSST).

      (d)  Salmon fisheries off the coast of California affecting this ESA-listed stock are managed to meet the conservation objective described in Salmon FMP table 3-1.

      (1) The annual specifications and management measures will include an allowable harvest level expressed in numbers of Chinook salmon for the salmon fisheries off the coast of California that is projected, using the Klamath Ocean Harvest Model and Sacramento Harvest Model, to ensure fisheries do not exceed the conservation objective. A harvest rate that is lower than the conservation objective may be used to determine the allowable harvest level in order to address the potential for exceeding the objective in a particular year. The lower harvest rate will be determined in two steps.

      (i) In the first step, NMFS and the Council will calculate the average percent error (defined as the difference between the preseason projected HR and the post-season estimated HR, divided by the post-season estimated HR, and expressed as a percentage) averaged over the most recent 5 years, and apply the average percent error to the conservation objective. Only positive percent error will be applied because the intent is to keep the post-season harvest rate below the conservation objective.

      (ii) In the second step, other relevant factors affecting the preseason assessment of the age-4 KRFC harvest rate will be considered, such as revisions to the fishery management models used to estimate the preseason Chinook catch, environmental indicators relevant to the status of KRFC, constraints on fisheries under consideration for the areas and months with greatest impacts to KRFC Chinook, and the lower harvest rate may be modified based on these factors.

      (2) The annual specifications and management measures will include the following management measures to ensure fisheries affecting California Coastal Chinook do not exceed the allowable harvest level.

      (i) Landing and possession limits will be used in the commercial troll fisheries to keep fishery catch within the allowable harvest level. Landing and possession limits will be set for periods not to exceed 1 week. Landing and possession limits may vary from one calendar month to the next but will be the same for periods within the same calendar month.

      (ii) A percentage of the allowable harvest level ( trigger) that will require consideration of inseason action to ensure that the allowable harvest level is not exceeded will be set through the annual management measures.

      (iii) For the first 2 years after the promulgation of this rule in which a salmon fishery occurs in the EEZ off the California coast, inseason actions will only be used to further restrict harvest ( reduce landing limits, reduce time/area, and close the fishery when the allowable harvest level is projected to have been met).

      (3) Electronic fish tickets must be submitted within 24 hours of landing to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Fish tickets must be submitted in accordance with the requirements of the applicable State regulations.

      (4) NMFS will implement inseason actions as described in § 660.409, following processes described in that section, as needed to ensure catch in the fishery does not exceed the allowable harvest level and will close areas and seasons upon reaching the allowable harvest limit.

      § 660.412   EFH identifications and descriptions for Pacific salmon.

#### § § 660.412

      Essential fish habitat (EFH) is identified for anadromous Pacific salmon stocks managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) under the Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP). These managed salmon include most of the Chinook salmon () stocks and all of the coho salmon () stocks from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California; as well as pink salmon () stocks originating from watersheds within Puget Sound east of, and including, the Elwha River. The geographic extent of freshwater EFH is specifically identified in the FMP as all water bodies currently or historically occupied by PFMC-managed salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California; including aquatic areas above all artificial barriers that are not specifically excluded. Freshwater EFH, identified in Table 1 of this subpart H, is described using fourth field hydrologic unit codes developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (defined in U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service: Federal guidelines, requirements, and procedures for the national Watershed Boundary Dataset: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods 11-A3, 2009). Table 1 also identifies the dams that represent the upstream extent of EFH in each hydrologic unit.

      (a) Chinook salmon EFH includes all water bodies currently or historically occupied by PFMC-managed Chinook salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California as identified in Table 1 of this subpart. Chinook salmon EFH also includes the estuarine and marine areas extending from the extreme high tide line in nearshore and tidal submerged environments within state territorial waters out to the full extent of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles) offshore of Washington, Oregon, and California north of Point Conception; and the marine areas of Alaska that are designated as Chinook salmon EFH by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC), for stocks that are also managed by the PFMC.

      (b) Coho salmon EFH includes all water bodies currently or historically occupied by PFMC-managed coho salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California as identified in Table 1 of this subpart. Coho salmon EFH also includes the estuarine and marine areas extending from the extreme high tide line in nearshore and tidal submerged environments within state territorial waters out to the full extent of the EEZ (200 nautical miles) offshore of Washington, Oregon, and California north of Point Conception; and the marine areas of Alaska that are designated as coho salmon EFH by the NPFMC, for stocks that are also managed by the PFMC.

      (c) Puget Sound pink salmon EFH includes all water bodies currently or historically occupied by PFMC-managed Puget Sound pink salmon in Washington State as identified in Table 1 of this subpart. Puget Sound pink salmon EFH also includes the estuarine and marine areas extending from the extreme high tide line in nearshore and tidal submerged environments within state territorial waters north and east of Cape Flattery, Washington, including Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Strait of Georgia; the waters of the U.S. EEZ north of 48° N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border; and marine areas of Alaska that are designated as pink salmon EFH by the NPFMC, for stocks that are also managed by the PFMC.

      § 660.413   Overfished species rebuilding plans.

#### § § 660.413

      For each overfished salmon stock with an approved rebuilding plan, annual management measures will be established using the standards in this section, specifically the target date for rebuilding the stock to its maximum sustainable yield (*MSY*) level (generally expressed as S) and the harvest control rule to be used to rebuild the stock.

      (a)  KRFC was declared overfished in 2018. The target year for rebuilding the KRFC stock is 2020. The harvest control rule during the rebuilding period for the KRFC stock is the  control rule specified in the FMP and at § 660.410(c), which allows for limited fishing impacts when abundance falls below S The control rule describes maximum allowable exploitation rates at any given level of abundance. The control rule is presented in Figure 1 of subpart H of this part.

      (1) The KRFC control rule uses reference points F MSST, S, and two levels of  exploitation rates, F = 0.10 and F = 0.25. The maximum allowable exploitation rate, F, in a given year, depends on the pre-fishery ocean abundance in spawner equivalent units, N. At high abundance, the control rule caps the exploitation rate at F at moderate abundance, the control rule specifies an F that results in S spawners; and at low abundance ( when expected escapement is below S), the control rule allows for  exploitation rates with the abundance breakpoints defined as: A = MSST/2; B = (MSST + S)/2; C = S/(1—0.25); D = S/(1—F), as shown in Figure 1 of subpart H of this part. For N between 0 and A, F increases linearly from 0 at N = 0, to 0.10 at N = A. For N between A and MSST, F is equal to 0.10. For N between MSST and B, F increases linearly from 0.10 at N = MSST, to 0.25 at N = B. For N between B and C, F is equal to 0.25. For N between C and D, F is the value that results in S spawners. For N greater than D, F is equal to F

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) [Reserved]

      (c)  The Juan de Fuca coho salmon stock was declared overfished in 2018. The target year for rebuilding Juan de Fuca coho is 2023. The harvest control rule during the rebuilding period for Juan de Fuca coho is the abundance-based stepped harvest rate as shown in table 1 to this paragraph (c).

      (d)  The Queets coho salmon stock was declared overfished in 2018. The target year for rebuilding Queets coho is 2019. The harvest control rule during the rebuilding period for Queets coho is the abundance-based stepped harvest rate as shown in table 2 to this paragraph (d).

      (a)  (1) This section applies to fishing for or landing CPS finfish in the limited entry fishery in the Limited Entry Zone.

      (2) Effective January 1, 2000, the owner of a vessel with more than 5 mt of CPS finfish on board in the CPS Limited Entry Zone, other than live bait, must have a limited entry permit registered for use with that vessel.

      (3) Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) qualifies to be issued or may hold, by ownership or otherwise, a limited entry permit.

      (b)  (1) A limited entry permit for a vessel will be issued only if that vessel landed 100 mt of CPS finfish from January 1, 1993, through November 5, 1997.

      (2) A limited entry permit will be issued only to the current owner of the vessel, unless:

      (i) The previous owner of a vessel qualifying for a permit, by the express terms of a written contract, reserved the right to the limited entry permit, in which case the limited entry permit will be issued to the previous owner based on the catch history of the qualifying vessel, or

      (ii) A vessel that would have qualified for a limited entry permit was totally lost prior to issuance of a limited entry permit. In this case, the owner of the vessel at the time it was lost retains the right to a permit for a replacement vessel, unless the owner conveyed the right to another person by the express terms of a written contract. The lost vessel must be replaced within 2 years of the date that the qualifying vessel was lost, and the replaced vessel must be of equal or less net tonnage.

      (c)  A vessel owner (or person holding limited entry rights under the express terms of a written contract as specified in paragraph (a)(2)) of this section applying for issuance, renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited entry permit must prove that the qualification requirements are met by submitting the following documentation:

      (1) A certified copy of the vessel's documentation as a fishing vessel of the United States (U.S. Coast Guard or state) is the best evidence of vessel ownership;

      (2) A certified copy of a state fish landing receipt is the best evidence of a landing of a vessel;

      (3) A copy of a written contract reserving or conveying limited entry rights is the best evidence of reserved or acquired rights; and

      (4) Other relevant, credible evidence that the applicant may wish to submit or that the SFD may request or require.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator may charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to issuing limited entry permits, as well as renewing, transferring, and replacing permits. The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.

      (e)  (1) The SFD will make initial decisions regarding issuing, renewing, transferring, and registering limited entry permits.

      (2) Adverse decisions shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the adverse decision.

      (3) The SFD may decline to act on an application for issuing, renewing, transferring, or registering a limited entry permit and will notify the applicant, if the permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.

      (f)  (1) The SFD will issue limited entry permits.

      (2) In order to receive a final decision on a limited entry permit application before January 1, 2000, an applicant must submit the application to the SFD on or before February 14, 2000.

      (3) A separate, complete, and accurate application form, accompanied by any required supporting documentation and the appropriate fee, must be submitted for each vessel for which a limited entry permit is sought.

      (4) Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed application, the SFD will notify the applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered void.

      (5) The SFD may request further documentation before acting on an application.

      (6) The SFD will not accept applications for a limited entry permit after July 1, 2000.

      (g)  (1) Any applicant for an initial permit may appeal the initial issuance decision to the Regional Administrator. To be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (2) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal.

      (3) Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will decide the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in this section and in the FMP, as appropriate, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information submitted to or obtained by the Regional Administrator, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (4) If a hearing is requested or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing to the applicant. The appellant and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (5) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's action shall constitute final action for the agency for the purposes of the APA.

      (6) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days by the Regional Administrator for good cause, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the appellant stating the reason(s) therefore.

      (h)  (1) When the aggregate gross tonnage of all vessels participating in the limited entry fishery declines below 5,650.9 metric tons (mt), the Council will review the status of the fishery, taking into consideration:

      (i) The changes in gross tonnage that have and are likely to occur in the transfer of limited entry permits;

      (ii) The actual harvesting capacity as experienced in the current fishery in comparison to the capacity goal;

      (iii) Comments of the CPSMT;

      (iv) Any other relevant factors related to maintaining the capacity goal.

      (2) Following its review, the Council will recommend to NMFS whether additional permit(s) should be issued and if the new permit(s) should be temporary or permanent. The issuance of new permit(s) shall be based on the following:

      (i) The qualifying criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, but vessels that were issued a permit before December 31, 2000, are not eligible.

      (ii) If no vessel meets the qualifying criteria in paragraph (b), then the permit(s) will be issued to the vessel(s) with total landings nearest 100 mt during the qualifying period of paragraph (b).

      (iii) No vessel will be issued a permit under this paragraph (h) that is currently registered for use with a permit.

      (3) The Regional Administrator will review the Council's recommendation and determine whether issuing additional permit(s) is consistent with the FMP and with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. If issuing additional permit(s) is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will:

      (i) Issue the appropriate number of permits consistent with the Council's recommendation; and

      (ii) Publish a document in the  notifying the public that new permits or a new permit has been issued, the conditions attached to any permit, and the reasons for the action.

      § 660.513   Permit conditions.

#### § § 660.513

      (a) A limited entry permit expires on failure to renew the limited entry permit as specified in § 660.515.

      (b) A limited entry permit may not be used with a vessel unless it is registered for use with that vessel. Limited entry permits will be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the permit is issued, renewed, or transferred.

      (c) Limited entry permits issued or applied for under this subpart are subject to sanctions pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. 1858(g), and 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.

      § 660.514   Transferability.

#### § § 660.514

      (a)  (1) The SFD will process applications for transferring limited entry permits to a different owner and/or to a different vessel according to this section.

      (2) After January 27, 2003, the SFD will issue a limited entry permit to the owner of each vessel permitted to participate in the limited entry fishery for CPS. This permit will replace the existing permit and will include the gross tonnage of the vessel, which will constitute an endorsement for that vessel for the purpose of regulating the transfer of limited entry permits.

      (b)  (1) When the aggregate gross tonnage of all vessels participating the limited entry fishery is at or below 5,650.9 mt, a permit may be transferred to a different owner or to a different vessel in the following circumstances only:

      (i) A permit may be transferred to a vessel without a permit if the vessel without a permit has a comparable capacity to the capacity on the permit or is less than comparable capacity on the permit.

      (ii) When a permit is transferred to a vessel without a permit that has less gross tonnage than that of the permitted vessel, the excess gross tonnage may not be separated from the permit and applied to a second vessel.

      (iii) A permit may be transferred to a vessel without a permit that is of greater than comparable capacity only if two or more permits are transferred to the vessel without a permit to equal the gross tonnage of the vessel. The number of permits required will be determined by adding together the comparable capacity of all permits being transferred. Any gross tonnage in excess of that needed for a vessel remains with the permit.

      (2) When a vessel with multiple permits leaves the fishery, the permits may be sold separately and applied to other vessels according to the criteria in this section.

      (c)  (1) The gross tonnage endorsement of a permit is integral to the permit for the duration of the permit, regardless of the gross tonnage of any vessel to which the permit is transferred.

      (2) Permits may be used only on the vessel for which they are registered by the SFD. All permits that authorize a vessel to operate in the limited entry fishery must be on board the vessel during any fishing trip on which CPS is harvested or is on board.

      (3) A permit may be transferred only once during a calendar year.

      (d)  (1) A permitted vessel's length, breadth, or depth may be altered to increase the gross tonnage of the vessel only if the aggregate gross tonnage of all vessels participating in the limited entry fishery equals, or is below 5,650.9 mt, and only under the following conditions:

      (i) The gross tonnage of the altered vessel, calculated according to the formula in 46 CFR 69.209(a), does not exceed 110 percent of the vessel's original gross tonnage endorsement, and

      (ii) A new certificate of documentation is obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard or State. Modifications exceeding 110 percent of the vessel's gross tonnage endorsement will require registration of the vessel under an additional permit or permits or under a permit with a sufficient gross tonnage endorsement.

      (2) A copy of the certificate of documentation indicating changes in length, depth, or breadth must be provided to the SFD.

      (3) The revised gross tonnage will not be valid as an endorsement until a revised permit is issued by the SFD.

      (e)  (1) All requests for the transfer of a limited entry permit will be made to the SFD in writing and shall contain the following information:

      (i) Name, address, and phone number of the owner of the permitted vessel.

      (ii) Name of the permitted vessel and documentation number of the vessel.

      (iii) Name, address, and phone number of the owner of the vessel to which the permit is to be transferred.

      (iv) Name and documentation number of the vessel to which the permit is to be transferred.

      (v) Signature(s) of the owner(s) of the vessels participating in the transfer.

      (vi) Any other information that the SFD may request.

      (2) No permit transfer is effective until the transfer has been authorized by the SFD.

      (f)  (1) When the aggregate gross tonnage of the limited entry fleet reaches 5,933.5 mt, a permit may be transferred to a vessel without a permit only if the vessel without a permit is of the same or less gross tonnage.

      (2) When the aggregate gross tonnage of the limited entry fleet reaches 5,933.5 mt, alterations in the length, depth, or breadth of a permitted vessel may not result in an increase in the gross tonnage of the vessel.

Vessel owners who want to have their EM Authorizations effective for January 1 of the following calendar year must submit their complete renewal form to NMFS by October 15. Vessel owners who want to have their EM Authorizations effective for the primary whiting season start date of the following calendar year must submit their complete renewal form to NMFS by February 1.

      (j)  The specifications ( image resolution, frame rate, user interface) and configuration of an EM system and associated equipment ( number and placement of cameras, lighting) used to meet the requirements of this section must be sufficient to:

      (1) Allow easy and complete viewing, identification, and quantification, of catch items discarded at sea, including during low light conditions;

      (2) Continuously record vessel location (latitude/longitude coordinates), velocity, course, and sensor data ( hydraulic and winch activity);

      (3) Allow the identification of the time, date, and location of a haul/set or discard event;

      (4) Record and store image data from all hauls/sets and the duration that fish are onboard the vessel until offloading begins;

      (5) Continuously record and store raw sensor data ( GPS and gear sensors) for the entire fishing trip;

      (6) Prevent radio frequency interference (RFI) with vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and other equipment;

      (7) Allow the vessel operator to test and monitor the functionality of the EM system prior to and during the fishing trip to ensure it is fully functional;

      (8) Prevent tampering or, if tampering does occur, show evidence of tampering; and,

      (9) Provide image and sensor data in a format that enables their integration for analysis.

      (k)  A vessel owner with a valid EM Authorization must obtain EM data processing, reporting, and record retention services from a NMFS-permitted EM service provider, as described at § 660.603(m). If the vessel owner changes EM service providers, the vessel owner must ensure the continuity of EM data retention for the entire duration of the required retention period as specified § 660.603(m)(6). NMFS will maintain a list of permitted EM service providers on its website.

      (l) The EM system must be recording imagery and sensor data at all times that fish harvested during an EM trip are onboard the vessel until offloading begins. For the purposes of this section, a fully functional EM system is defined as an EM system and associated equipment that meets the performance standards listed in paragraph (j) of this section.

      (1)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must maintain the EM system in good working order, including:

      (i) Ensuring the EM system is powered continuously during the fishing trip;

      (ii) Ensuring the system is functioning for the entire fishing trip and that camera views are unobstructed and clear in quality, such that the performance standards listed in paragraph (j) of this section are met; and,

      (iii) Ensuring EM system components are not tampered with, disabled, destroyed, operated or maintained improperly.

      (2)  Prior to departing port, the operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must turn the EM system on and conduct a system function test following the instructions from the EM service provider. The vessel operator must verify that the EM system has adequate memory to record the entire trip and that the vessel is carrying one or more spare hard drives with sufficient capacity to record the entire trip.

      (3)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization is prohibited from fishing on an EM trip without a fully functional EM system, unless an alternate arrangement has been specified in the NMFS-accepted VMP. In the event of an EM system malfunction, the vessel operator may voluntarily obtain observer coverage and revise the vessel's declaration following the process at § 660.13(d)(4), in which case the vessel operator is no longer exempt from the observer requirements at §§ 660.140(h) and 660.150(j).

      (m)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must make a declaration report to NMFS OLE prior to leaving port following the process described at § 660.13(d)(4). A declaration report will be valid until another declaration report revising the existing gear or monitoring declaration is received by NMFS OLE.

      (n)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must provide advanced notice to NMFS, at least 48 hours prior to departing port, of the vessel operator's intent to take a trip under EM, including: vessel name, permit number; contact name and telephone number for coordination of observer deployment; date, time, and port of departure; and the vessel's trip plan, including area to be fished, gear type to be used, and whether the vessel will use maximized or optimized retention rules for the trip as defined at paragraphs (p)(3) and (4) of this section. NMFS may waive this requirement for vessels declared into the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery or mothership sector with prior notice. If NMFS notifies the vessel owner, operator, or manager of any requirement to carry an observer, the vessel may not be used to fish for groundfish without carrying an observer. The vessel operator must comply with the following requirements on a trip that the vessel owner, operator, or manager has been notified is required to carry an observer.

      (o)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must make the EM system and associated equipment available for inspection immediately upon request by NMFS or any authorized officer.

      (p) —(1)  The operator of a vessel on a declared limited entry midwater trawl, Pacific whiting shorebased IFQ trip or limited entry midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector (catcher vessel or mothership) trip, EM trip must retain all fish until landing, with exceptions listed in paragraphs (p)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.

      (i) Minor operational discards are permitted. Minor operational discards include mutilated fish; fish vented from an overfull codend, fish spilled from the codend during preparation for transfer to the mothership; and fish removed from the deck and fishing gear during cleaning.

All discards must be discarded following instructions in the VMP per paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. All discards, regardless of the source, must be reported in a discard logbook, as defined at § 660.604(s)(1), including the species (where possible), estimated weight, and reason for discard. The vessel operator is responsible for ensuring that all catch is handled in a manner that enables the EM system to record it.

      (i) Minor operational discards are permitted. Minor operational discards include mutilated fish; fish vented from an overfull codend; and fish removed from the deck and fishing gear during cleaning. Minor operational discards do not include discards that result when more catch is taken than is necessary to fill the hold or catch from a tow that is not delivered.

      (ii) Large individual marine organisms ( all marine mammals, sea turtles, and non-ESA-listed seabirds, and fish species longer than 6 ft (1.8 m) in length) may be discarded. For any ESA-listed seabirds that are brought on board, vessel operators must follow any relevant instructions for handling and disposition under § 660.21(c)(1)(v).

The vessel operator is responsible for ensuring that all catch is handled in a manner that enables the EM system to record it.

      (q)  NMFS may specify alternate retention requirements in a NMFS-accepted VMP through the process described in paragraph (f) of this section, after consultation with the Council and issuance of a public notice notifying the public of the changes. Alternate retention requirements must be sufficient to provide NMFS with the best available information to determine individual accountability for catch, including discards, of IFQ species and compliance with requirements of the Shorebased IFQ Program (§ 660.140) and MS Co-op Program (§ 660.150).

      (r)  The vessel operator of a vessel on an EM trip must ensure that all catch is handled in a manner that enables the EM system to record it and that is consistent with the specific catch handling instructions in the NMFS-accepted VMP.

      (s) —(1)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must complete, submit, and maintain onboard the vessel an accurate federal discard logbook for each EM trip on forms supplied by or approved by NMFS. If authorized in writing by NMFS, a vessel owner or operator may submit reports electronically, for example by using a VMS or other media. A state logbook that contains all the required information may be submitted in place of a federal discard logbook. If operating an MS/CV vessel, the vessel operator must provide logbook information to the mothership observer by transmitting the logbook information via radio or email to the mothership at the completion of each haul.

      (2)  Vessel operators must submit copies of the discard logbooks as described at § 660.604(s)(1) and if applicable, the trawl logbook as described at § 660.13 (a)(1), to the vessel owner's contracted EM service provider and to NMFS or its agent within 24 hours of the end of each EM trip.

      (3)  Vessel operators must submit EM data to the vessel owner's contracted EM service provider using a method that documents time, date, and location of transmission and receipt. Deadlines for submission are as follows:

      (i)  EM data from an EM trip must be submitted within 72 hours after the beginning of the offload (and no more than 10 days after the end of the first trip on the hard drive).

      (ii)  EM data from an EM trip must be submitted within 72 hours of the catcher vessel's return to port.

      (t)  The operator of a vessel with a valid EM Authorization must maintain federal discard logbooks onboard the vessel until the end of the fishing year during which the EM trips were conducted, and make the report forms available to observers, NMFS staff, or authorized officers, immediately upon request. The vessel owner must maintain the federal discard logbooks and other records specified in this section, or used in the preparation of records or reports specified in this section or corrections to these reports, for a period of not less than three years after the date of landing from an EM trip. The vessel owner must make such records available for inspection by NMFS staff or authorized officers, immediately upon request.

      § 660.706   Pacific Coast Treaty Indian rights.

#### § § 660.706

      (a) Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest HMS in their usual and accustomed (U&A) fishing areas in the EEZ.

      (b) Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes means the Hoh, Makah, and Quileute Indian Tribes and the Quinault Indian Nation.

      (c) The Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes' U&A fishing areas within the EEZ are set forth in § 660.4 of this chapter.

      (d)  The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will be implemented by the Secretary of Commerce, after consideration of the tribal request, the recommendation of the Council, and the comments of the public. The rights will be implemented either through an allocation of fish that will be managed by the tribes, or through regulations that will apply specifically to the tribal fisheries. An allocation or a regulation specific to the tribes shall be initiated by a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to the NMFS West Coast Regional Administrator, at least 120 days prior to the time the allocation is desired to be effective, and will be subject to public review through the Council process. The Secretary of Commerce recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of Indian tribes over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. Accordingly, the Secretary of Commerce will develop tribal allocations and regulations in consultation with the affected tribe(s) and, insofar as possible, with tribal consensus.

      (e)  A valid treaty Indian identification card issued pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the card.

      (f) Fishing (on a tribal allocation or under a Federal regulation applicable to tribal fisheries) by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe within that tribe's U&A fishing area is not subject to provisions of the HMS regulations applicable to non-treaty fisheries.

      (g) Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply with any applicable Federal and tribal laws and regulations, when participating in a tribal HMS fishery implemented under paragraph (d) of this section.

      (h) Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe outside that tribe's U&A fishing area, or for a species of HMS not covered by a treaty allocation or applicable Federal regulation, is subject to the HMS regulations applicable to non-treaty fisheries.

      § 660.707   Permits.

#### § § 660.707

      (a)  This section applies to vessels that fish for HMS off or land HMS in the States of California, Oregon, and Washington.

      (1) A commercial fishing vessel of the United States must be registered for use under a general HMS permit that authorizes the use of specific gear, and a recreational charter vessel must be registered for use under a HMS permit if that vessel is used:

      (i) To fish for HMS in the U.S. EEZ off the States of California, Oregon, and Washington; or

      (ii) To land or transship HMS shoreward of the outer boundary of the U.S. EEZ off the States of California, Oregon, and Washington.

      (2) The permit must be on board the vessel and available for inspection by an authorized officer, except that if the permit was issued while the vessel was at sea, this requirement applies only to any subsequent trip.

      (3) A permit is valid only for the vessel for which it is registered. A permit not registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used.

      (4) Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) may be issued or may hold (by ownership or otherwise) a general HMS permit.

      (b)  (1) Following publication of the final rule implementing the FMP, NMFS will issue general HMS permits to the owners of those vessels on a list of vessels obtained from owners previously applying for a permit under the authority of the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Fishery Management Plan for Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region, or whose vessels are listed on the vessel register of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.

      (2) All permits issued by NMFS in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section will authorize the use of specific fishing gear by the identified commercial fishing vessels.

      (3) An owner of a vessel subject to these requirements who has not received a permit under this section from NMFS and who wants to engage in the fisheries must apply to the SFD for the required permit in accordance with the following:

      (i) A West Coast Region Federal Fisheries application form may be obtained from the West Coast Region Fisheries Permits Office or downloaded from the West Coast Region website to apply for a permit under this section. A completed application is one that contains all the necessary information, and required fees, documentation, and signatures.

      (ii) A minimum of 15 days should be allowed for processing a permit application. If an incomplete or improperly completed application is filed, the applicant will be sent a notice of deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.

      (iii) A permit will be issued by the SFD. If an application is denied, the SFD will indicate the reasons for denial.

      (iv)(A) Any applicant for an initial permit may appeal the initial issuance decision to the Regional Administrator. To be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (B) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal.

      (C) Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will decide the appeal in accordance with the permit provisions set forth in this section at the time of the application, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information submitted to or obtained by the Regional Administrator, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons for the decision, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (D) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing to the applicant. The appellant, and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (E) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's decision will constitute the final administrative action by NMFS on the matter.

      (F) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days by the Regional Administrator for good cause, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the appellant stating the reason(s) therefore.

      (4) General HMS permits issued under this subpart will remain valid until the first date of renewal, and permits may be subsequently renewed for 2-year terms. The first date of renewal will be the last day of the vessel owner's birth month in the second calendar year after the permit is issued (e.g., if the birth month is March and the permit is issued on October 3, 2007, the permit will remain valid through March 31, 2009).

      (5) Replacement permits may be issued without charge to replace lost or mutilated permits. Replacement permits may be obtained by submitting to the SFD c/o the Regional Administrator a complete, signed vessel permit application. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application.

      (6) Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.

      (c)  Any permit issued under this subpart, or a facsimile of the permit, must be on board the vessel at all times while the vessel is fishing for, taking, retaining, possessing, or landing HMS shoreward of the outer boundary of the fishery management area unless the vessel was at sea at the time the permit was issued. Any permit issued under this section must be displayed for inspection upon request of an authorized officer.

      (d)  Procedures governing sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

      (e)  An application for a permit, or renewal of an existing permit under this section will include a fee for each vessel. The fee amount required will be calculated in accordance with the NOAA Finance Handbook and specified on the application form.

      (f) —(1)  This section applies to individuals fishing with large-mesh (14 inch or greater stretched mesh) drift gillnet (DGN) gear. Individuals who target, retain, transship, or land fish captured with a large-mesh DGN must possess a valid Federal limited entry DGN permit. Federal limited entry DGN permits are issued to an individual, and a vessel must be specified on the permit.

      (2)  Upon publication of NMFS' final rule to establish the Federal limited entry DGN permit, all State of California limited entry DGN permit holders are eligible to obtain a Federal limited entry DGN permit. If a 2017-2018 California state DGN permit renewal application is not received by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife or postmarked by March 31, 2018, the permit holder is not eligible to receive a 2018-2019 Federal limited entry DGN permit.

      (3)  An individual applying for issuance, renewal, transfer, or assignment of a Federal limited entry DGN permit must prove that they meet the qualification requirements by submitting the following documentation, as applicable: A certified copy of the assigned vessel's documentation as a fishing vessel of the United States (U.S. Coast Guard or state) is the best evidence of vessel identification; a copy of a current State of California limited entry DGN permit is the best evidence of initial qualification for a Federal limited entry DGN permit; a copy of a written contract reserving or conveying limited entry rights is the best evidence of reserved or acquired rights; and other relevant, credible evidence that the applicant may wish to submit or that the SFD may request or require.

      (4)  Any processing fee will be determined by the service costs needed to process a permit request. If a fee is required, it would cover administrative expenses related to issuing limited entry permits, as well as renewing, transferring, assigning, and replacing permits. The amount of any fee will be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each special product or service. A fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.

      (5)  (i) The SFD will make initial decisions regarding issuing, renewing, transferring, and assigning limited entry permits.

      (ii) Adverse decisions shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the adverse decision.

      (iii) The SFD may decline to act on an application for issuing, renewing, transferring, or assigning a limited entry permit and will notify the applicant, if the permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.

      (6)  Federal limited entry DGN permits will be issued by the SFD. If an application is denied, the SFD will indicate the reasons for denial. A DGN permit will be issued to an individual and assigned to a specific vessel. A permit holder may assign the permit to another vessel once per permit year (April 1 to March 31).

      (7)  Any applicant for an initial permit may appeal the initial issuance decision to the Regional Administrator. Appeals will be made and processed following procedures as described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (8)  Federal limited entry DGN permits may be transferred to another individual only if the current permit holder has held the Federal DGN permit for a minimum of three consecutive years (counted April 1 to March 31 of the following year). At the time of the establishment of the Federal limited entry DGN permit system, the length of time an individual has held a State of California limited entry DGN permit carries over (e.g., if an individual has held a California DGN permit for two years, they are eligible to transfer the Federal DGN permit after holding the Federal DGN permit for one year). Exceptions to this limitation on permit transfer may be made under the following circumstances:

      (i) The permit holder suffers from a serious illness or permanent disability that prevents the permit holder from earning a livelihood from commercial fishing.

      (ii) If a deceased permit holder's estate or heirs submit a transfer request within six months of the permit holder's death.

      (iii) Upon dissolution of marriage if the permit is held as community property.

      (9)  (i) The SFD will send notices to renew limited entry permits to the most recent address of the permit holder on file.

      (ii) The permit owner is responsible for renewing a limited entry permit.

      (iii) The deadline for receipt or postmark of a Federal DGN permit renewal application is April 30 of the permit year ( April 30, 2019 for 2019-2020 fishing season). Federal DGN permits must be renewed yearly.

      (iv) A DGN permit that is allowed to expire will not be renewed unless the permit owner requests reissuance by July 31 (three months after the renewal application deadline) and NMFS determines that failure to renew was proximately caused by illness, injury, or death of the permit owner. If the permit expires, it will be forfeited and NMFS will not reissue the permit to anyone.

      (10)  (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(10)(ii) through (v) of this section, the DGN permit holder must be on-board the vessel and in possession of a valid Federal limited entry DGN permit when engaged in DGN fishing activity.

      (ii) A permit holder may designate another individual to fish under their permit for up to 15 days per fishing year (April 1 to March 31 of the following year); the substitute must comply with all other Federal permitting requirements. A permit holder shall notify NMFS of a substitution at least 24 hours prior to the commencement of the trip.

      (iii) If the person who owns a Federal DGN permit is prevented from being on-board a fishing vessel because the person died, is ill, or is injured, NMFS may allow an exemption to the owner on-board requirement for more than 15 days. The person requesting the exemption must send a letter to NMFS requesting an exemption from the owner on-board requirements, with appropriate evidence as described at paragraph (f)(10)(iv) or (v) of this section. All exemptions for death, injury, or illness will be evaluated by NMFS and a decision will be made in writing to the permit owner (or, in the case of the death of the permit owner, to the estate or heirs of the permit owner) within 60 calendar days of receipt of the original exemption request.

      (iv) Evidence of death of the permit owner shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a copy of a death certificate. In the interim before the estate is settled, if the deceased permit owner was subject to the owner on-board requirements, the estate of the deceased permit owner may send a letter to NMFS with a copy of the death certificate, requesting an exemption from the owner-on-board requirements. An exemption due to death of the permit owner will be effective only until such time that the estate of the deceased permit owner has registered the deceased permit owner's permit to a beneficiary, transferred the permit to another owner, or three years after the date of death as proven by a death certificate, whichever is earliest. An exemption from the owner-on-board requirement will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the estate of the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during DGN fishing operations.

      (v) Evidence of illness or injury that prevents the permit owner from participating in the fishery shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a letter from a certified medical practitioner. This letter must detail the relevant medical conditions of the permit owner and how those conditions prevent the permit owner from being on-board a fishing vessel during DGN fishing. An exemption due to injury or illness will be effective only for the fishing year of the request for exemption. In order to extend a medical exemption for a succeeding year, the permit owner must submit a new request and provide documentation from a certified medical practitioner detailing why the permit owner is still unable to be on-board a fishing vessel. An exemption from the owner-on-board requirement will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during DGN fishing operations.

      (g) —(1)  This paragraph (g) applies to persons (as defined at § 660.702) owning a limited entry permit to fish with DSBG (as defined at § 660.702) inside the Southern California Bight (as defined at § 660.715(d)(2)) and to vessels registered to such permits. For a vessel to be used to fish with DSBG in the Southern California Bight, that vessel must be registered for use with a limited entry DSBG permit.

      (2)  Limited entry DSBG permits are issued to a person, and a vessel must be specified on the permit.

      (i)  Any “person” as defined at § 660.702 may own a limited entry DSBG permit, subject to the ownership requirements and limitations at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

      (ii)  A vessel registered to a limited entry DSBG permit must also be registered to a valid general HMS permit with a DSBG endorsement issued pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The designated vessel need not be owned by the limited entry DSBG permit owner. The same vessel may be registered to multiple limited entry DSBG permits, but only one permit may be fished at a time.

      (3) —(i)  No person may own more than one limited entry DSBG permit, in whole or in part, including through ownership interest in a partnership, corporation, or other entity.

      (ii)  Any person that owns a limited entry DSBG permit and that is applying for or renewing a limited entry DSBG permit shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the limited entry DSBG permit. This ownership interest must be documented with NMFS via the DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form.

      (iii)  Limited entry DSBG permits are not transferable, except for a one-time transfer to a family member, as defined at § 660.702, upon the death or legal incapacitation of the individual or a member of the corporation, partnership, or other entity that owns the permit, following the procedures at paragraph (g)(7) of this section. The limited entry DSBG permit owner cannot change or add additional individuals or entities as owners of the permit, or otherwise change ownership of the permit as defined at § 660.702. A transfer may not occur if such a transfer will result in a person holding more than one limited entry DSBG permit as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.

      (iv)  If NMFS discovers that a person owns or has an ownership interest in more than one limited entry DSBG permit (including any person who has ownership interest in the entities listed as owners on the permit), NMFS will notify the permit owner that they have 90 days to divest of the excess ownership interest. During this 90-day period, the person may surrender permit(s) in excess of the permit ownership limit to NMFS by submitting a request in writing. After the 90-day divestiture period, NMFS will revoke all limited entry DSBG permits held by that person in excess of the permit ownership limit. Surrendered and revoked permits, with vessel status as “unidentified,” will be issued to the next eligible applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section.

      (4)  Limited entry DSBG permits are valid for 1 year (May 1-April 30). Permits expire April 30 of each year and must be renewed between February 1 and March 31 of each year to remain in force the following permit year.

      (i)  NMFS will send notices to renew limited entry DSBG permits to the permit owner's most recent email address on record with NMFS. The permit owner is responsible for notifying the Fisheries Permits Office of any email address change.

      (ii)  A complete limited entry DSBG permit renewal package must be received by NMFS by March 31 of each year. If a complete renewal package is not received by March 31, NMFS will not renew the limited entry DSBG permit, except under the circumstances described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section. A complete renewal package consists of a completed renewal application form, a completed DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The renewal package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.

      (iii)  A limited entry DSBG permit for which renewal is not requested will be considered expired unless the permit owner requests reissuance of the permit by June 30 (3 months after the renewal application deadline) and NMFS determines that failure to renew was proximately caused by illness, injury, or death of the permit owner. If a permit is allowed to expire, it will be forfeited and NMFS may reissue the permit to another qualified applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section.

      (iv)  Based on a complete application for renewal of a limited entry DSBG permit, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section and is in compliance with any other applicable regulations, NMFS will approve the renewal and issue the permit. If the application is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative decision (IAD) that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (5)  Replacement permits may be issued without charge to replace lost or mutilated permits. Replacement permits may be obtained by submitting a complete permit replacement application to NMFS. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.

      (6)  Limited entry DSBG permits will normally be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the permit is issued, renewed, or replaced. A permit may not be used with any vessel other than the vessel registered for use with that permit. If the permit will be used with a vessel other than the one registered for use with the permit, the permit owner must request a change in vessel registration in accordance with paragraphs (g)(6)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

      (i)  The registered vessel may be changed no more than once per calendar year, except in cases of a  event as defined at § 660.702. A permit owner may also designate the vessel registration for a permit as “unidentified,” meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. Changing a permit's designated vessel to “unidentified” is not considered a change in vessel registration for purposes of this section, but the permit is not authorized for use until a subsequent change of registration out of “unidentified” status occurs. Any subsequent change in registration out of “unidentified” status to a vessel will be considered a change in vessel registration and subject to a once-per-calendar-year limit.

      (ii)  To request a change in vessel registration, a permit owner must fill out a vessel transfer application online through the NOAA Fisheries Permits website with appropriate fields completed and must submit the application to the West Coast Region Fisheries Permits Office. A complete change in vessel registration package consists of a transfer application form with appropriate fields completed, a current copy of the United States Coast Guard Documentation Form or state registration form, and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The change in vessel registration package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application. A permit owner may designate the vessel registration for a permit as “unidentified,” meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. No vessel is authorized to use a permit with the vessel registration designated as “unidentified.”

      (iii)  Based on a complete application for a change in vessel registration, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will approve the change in vessel registration and issue the permit. Changes in vessel registration will take effect on the date that the change is approved by NMFS. If the application for a change in vessel registration is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (7) —(i)  A permit owner may request change in ownership of a permit, in compliance with the limits at paragraph (g)(3) of this section, by submitting a complete transfer application package with appropriate fields completed to NMFS. A complete transfer application package consists of all of the following:

      (A) A transfer application form with appropriate fields completed;

      (B) For a request to change a permit's ownership where the current permit owner is a corporation, partnership or other business entity, a corporate resolution that authorizes the conveyance of the permit to a new owner and authorizes the individual applicant to request the conveyance on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or other business entity;

      (C) For a request to change a permit's ownership that is necessitated by the death of the permit owner(s), a death certificate of the permit owner(s) and appropriate legal documentation that either: Specifically registers the permit to a designated individual(s); or provides legal authority to the transferor to convey the permit ownership; and

      (D) Payment of required fees.

      (ii)  NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application for change in ownership. The renewal package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.

      (iii)  Based on a complete application for change in ownership, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will approve the change in ownership and issue the permit. Changes in permit ownership will take effect on the date that the change is approved by NMFS. If the application is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative decision (IAD) that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (8)  The Regional Administrator may charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to processing initial issuance, renewal, change in ownership, change in vessel registration, divestiture, and appeals of permits. The amount of the fee is determined in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs. A fee may not exceed administrative costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.

      (9)  NMFS may decline to act on an application for initial issuance, renewal, replacement, change in ownership, divestiture, or change in vessel registration, and will notify the applicant if the permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.

      (10)  In cases where the applicant disagrees with NMFS' decision on a permit application for initial issuance, renewal, replacement, change in ownership, divestiture, or change in vessel registration, the applicant may file an appeal following the procedures described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (_1_1)  This section describes the process for initial issuance of limited entry DSBG permits to applicants that qualify under Tiers 1 through _8_ as defined at paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)() through () of this section.

As used in this paragraph, float line means a line used to suspend the main longline beneath a float.

      (4) From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline gear may not use longline gear in waters bounded on the south by 0° lat., on the north by 15° N. lat., on the east by 145° W. long., and on the west by 180° long.

      (5) From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline gear may not receive from another vessel HMS that were harvested by longline gear in waters bounded on the south by 0° lat., on the north by 15° N. lat., on the east by 145° W. long., and on the west by 180° long.

      (6) From April 1 through May 31, owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline gear may not land or transship HMS that were harvested by longline gear in waters bounded on the south by 0° lat., on the north by 15° N. lat., on the east by 145° W. long., and on the west by 180° long.

      (7) No light stick may be possessed on board a vessel registered for use of longline gear during fishing trips that include any fishing west of 150° W. long. and north of the equator (0° N. lat.). A light stick as used in this paragraph is any type of light emitting device, including any flourescent glow bead, chemical, or electrically powered light that is affixed underwater to the longline gear.

      (8) When a conventional monofilament longline is deployed in waters west of 150° W. long. and north of the equator (0° N. lat.) by a vessel registered for use of longline gear, no fewer than 15 branch lines may be set between any two floats. Vessel operators using basket-style longline gear must set a minimum of 10 branch lines between any 2 floats when fishing in waters north of the equator.

      (9) Longline gear deployed west of 150° W. long. and north of the equator (0° N. lat.) by a vessel registered for use of longline gear must be deployed such that the deepest point of the main longline between any two floats,  the deepest point in each sag of the main line, is at a depth greater than 100 m (328.1 ft or 54.6 fm) below the sea surface.

      (10) If no observer is on board the vessel, owners and operators of longline vessels registered for use of longline gear may land or possess no more than 10 swordfish from a fishing trip when using any J-type fishing hooks, and no more than 25 swordfish from a fishing trip when using only circle hook-type fishing hooks. If a NMFS-approved observer is on board the vessel for the duration of the fishing trip, there is no limit on the amount of swordfish retained.

      (11) Owners and operators of longline vessels registered for use of longline gear are subject to the provisions at 50 CFR part 223 prohibiting shallow sets to target swordfish in waters beyond the U.S. EEZ and east of 150° W. long.

      (b)  (1) Owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline gear must carry aboard their vessels line clippers meeting the minimum design standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, dip nets meeting minimum standards specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and wire or bolt cutters capable of cutting through the vessel's hooks. These items must be used to disengage any hooked or entangled sea turtles with the least harm possible to the sea turtles and as close to the hook as possible in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(7) of this section.

      (2) Line clippers are intended to cut fishing line as close as possible to hooked or entangled sea turtles. NMFS has established minimum design standards for line clippers. The Arceneaux line clipper (ALC) is a model line clipper that meets these minimum design standards and may be fabricated from readily available and low-cost materials (see figure 1 to § 660.32). The minimum design standards are as follows:

      (i) The cutting blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a holder, or otherwise afforded some protection to minimize direct contact of the cutting surface with sea turtles or users of the cutting blade.

      (ii) The blade must be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm monofilament line and nylon or polypropylene multistrand material commonly known as braided mainline or tarred mainline.

      (iii) The line clipper must have an extended reach handle or pole of at least 6 ft (1.82 m).

      (iv) The cutting blade must be securely fastened to the extended reach handle or pole to ensure effective deployment and use.

      (3) Dip nets are intended to facilitate safe handling of sea turtles and access to sea turtles for purposes of cutting lines in a manner that minimizes injury and trauma to sea turtles. The minimum design standards for dip nets that meet the requirements of this section are:

      (i) The dip net must have an extended reach handle of at least 6 ft (1.82 m) of wood or other rigid material able to support a minimum of 100 lbs (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant bending or distortion.

      (ii) The dip net must have a net hoop of at least 31 inches (78.74 cm) inside diameter and a bag depth of at least 38 inches (96.52 cm). The bag mesh openings may be no more than 3 inches × 3 inches (7.62 cm × 7.62 cm).

      (4) All incidentally taken sea turtles brought aboard for dehooking and/or disentanglement must be handled in a manner to minimize injury and promote post-hooking survival.

      (i) When practicable, comatose sea turtles must be brought on board immediately, with a minimum of injury, and handled in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section.

      (ii) If a sea turtle is too large or hooked in such a manner as to preclude safe boarding without causing further damage/injury to the turtle, line clippers described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be used to clip the line and remove as much line as possible prior to releasing the turtle.

      (iii) If a sea turtle is observed to be hooked or entangled by longline gear during hauling operations, the vessel operator must immediately cease hauling operations until the turtle has been removed from the longline gear or brought on board the vessel.

      (iv) Hooks must be removed from sea turtles as quickly and carefully as possible. If a hook cannot be removed from a turtle, the line must be cut as close to the hook as possible.

      (5) If the sea turtle brought aboard appears dead or comatose, the sea turtle must be placed on its belly (on the bottom shell or plastron) so that the turtle is right side up and its hindquarters elevated at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) for a period of no less than 4 hours and no more than 24 hours. The amount of the elevation depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for larger turtles. A reflex test, performed by gently touching the eye and pinching the tail of a sea turtle, must be administered by a vessel operator, at least every 3 hours, to determine if the sea turtle is responsive. Sea turtles being resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or moist but under no circumstance may be placed into a container holding water. A water-soaked towel placed over the eyes, carapace, and flippers is the most effective method to keep a turtle moist. Those that revive and become active must be returned to the sea in the manner described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Sea turtles that fail to revive within the 24-hour period must also be returned to the sea in the manner described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

      (6) Live turtles must be returned to the sea after handling in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section:

      (i) By putting the vessel engine in neutral gear so that the propeller is disengaged and the vessel is stopped, and releasing the turtle away from deployed gear; and

      (ii) Observing that the turtle is safely away from the vessel before engaging the propeller and continuing operations.

      (7) In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a vessel operator shall perform sea turtle handling and resuscitation techniques consistent with 50 CFR 223.206(d)(1), as appropriate.

      (c)  (1) Seabird mitigation techniques. Owners and operators of vessels registered for use of longline gear must ensure that the following actions are taken when fishing north of 23° N. lat.:

      (i) Employ a line setting machine or line shooter to set the main longline when making deep sets west of 150° W. long. using monofilament main longline;

      (ii) Attach a weight of at least 45 g to each branch line within 1 m of the hook when making deep sets using monofilament main longline;

      (iii) When using basket-style longline gear, ensure that the main longline is deployed slack to maximize its sink rate;

      (2) Use completely thawed bait that has been dyed blue to an intensity level specified by a color quality control card issued by NMFS;

      (3) Maintain a minimum of two cans (each sold as 0.45 kg or 1 lb size) containing blue dye on board the vessel;

      (4) Discharge fish, fish parts (offal), or spent bait while setting or hauling longline gear, on the opposite side of the vessel from where the longline gear is being set or hauled;

      (5) Retain sufficient quantities of fish, fish parts, or spent bait, between the setting of longline gear for the purpose of strategically discharging it in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

      (6) Remove all hooks from fish, fish parts, or spent bait prior to its discharge in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and

      (7) Remove the bill and liver of any swordfish that is caught, sever its head from the trunk and cut it in half vertically, and periodically discharge the butchered heads and livers in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

      (8) If a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel registered for use of longline gear, owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:

      (i) Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the bird on board the vessel using a dip net;

      (ii) Cover the bird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils or damage while being handled;

      (iii) Remove any entangled lines from the bird;

      (iv) Determine if the bird is alive or dead.

      (A) If dead, freeze the bird immediately with an identification tag attached directly to the specimen listing the species, location and date of mortality, and band number if the bird has a leg band. Attach a duplicate identification tag to the bag or container holding the bird. Any leg bands present must remain on the bird. Contact NMFS, the Coast Guard, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS protected species workshop, inform them that you have a dead short-tailed albatross on board, and submit the bird to NMFS within 72 hours following completion of the fishing trip.

      (B) If alive, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (c)(9) through (c)(14) of this section.

      (9) Place the bird in a safe enclosed place;

      (10) Immediately contact NMFS, the Coast Guard, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the numbers listed on the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS protected species workshop and request veterinary guidance;

      (11) Follow the veterinary guidance regarding the handling and release of the bird.

      (12) Complete the short-tailed albatross recovery data form issued by NMFS.

      (13) If the bird is externally hooked and no veterinary guidance is received within 24-48 hours, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (c)(17)(iv) and (v) of this section, and release the bird only if it meets the following criteria:

      (i) Able to hold its head erect and respond to noise and motion stimuli;

      (ii) Able to breathe without noise;

      (iii) Capable of flapping and retracting both wings to normal folded position on its back;

      (iv) Able to stand on both feet with toes pointed forward; and

      (v) Feathers are dry.

      (14) If released under paragraph (c)(13) of this section or under the guidance of a veterinarian, all released birds must be placed on the sea surface.

      (15) If the hook has been ingested or is inaccessible, keep the bird in a safe, enclosed place and submit it to NMFS immediately upon the vessel's return to port. Do not give the bird food or water.

      (16) Complete the short-tailed albatross recovery data form issued by NMFS.

      (17) If a seabird other than a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel registered for use of longline gear, owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:

      (i) Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the seabird on board the vessel using a dip net;

      (ii) Cover the seabird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils or damage while being handled;

      (iii) Remove any entangled lines from the seabird;

      (iv) Remove any external hooks by cutting the line as close as possible to the hook, pushing the hook barb out point first, cutting off the hook barb using bolt cutters, and then removing the hook shank;

      (v) Cut the fishing line as close as possible to ingested or inaccessible hooks;

      (vi) Leave the bird in a safe enclosed space to recover until its feathers are dry; and

      (vii) After recovered, release seabirds by placing them on the sea surface.

      (d)  (1) Only a VMS unit owned by NMFS and installed by NMFS complies with the requirement of this subpart.

      (2) After the holder of a permit to use longline gear has been notified by the SAC of a specific date for installation of a VMS unit on the permit holder's vessel, the vessel must carry the VMS unit after the date scheduled for installation.

      (3) A longline permit holder will not be assessed any fee or other charges to obtain and use a VMS unit, including the communication charges related directly to requirements under this section. Communication charges related to any additional equipment attached to the VMS unit by the owner or operator shall be the responsibility of the owner or operator and not NMFS.

      (4) The holder of a longline permit and the master of the vessel operating under the permit must:

      (i) Provide opportunity for the SAC to install and make operational a VMS unit after notification.

      (ii) Carry the VMS unit on board whenever the vessel is at sea.

      (iii) Not remove or relocate the VMS unit without prior approval from the SAC.

      (5) The SAC has authority over the installation and operation of the VMS unit. The SAC may authorize the connection or order the disconnection of additional equipment, including a computer, to any VMS unit when deemed appropriate by the SAC.

      (e)  (1) Each year both the owner and the operator of a vessel registered for use of longline gear must attend and be certified for completion of a workshop conducted by NMFS on mitigation, handling, and release techniques for turtles and seabirds and other protected species.

      (2) A protected species workshop certificate will be issued by NMFS annually to any person who has completed the workshop.

      (3) An owner of a vessel registered for use of longline gear must have on file a valid protected species workshop certificate or copy issued by NMFS in order to maintain or renew their vessel registration.

      (4) An operator of a vessel registered for use of longline gear must have on board the vessel a valid protected species workshop certificate issued by NMFS or a legible copy thereof.

      (f) An operator of a vessel registered for use of longline gear must notify the Regional Administrator at least 24 hours prior to embarking on a fishing trip regardless of the intended area of fishing.

      (g) An operator of a vessel registered for use of longline gear in waters east of 150° W. long. and beyond the EEZ is subject to the requirements at 50 CFR part 223.

      § 660.713   Drift gillnet fishery.

#### § § 660.713

      (a)  Gear restrictions resulting from the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan established under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 can be found at 50 CFR 229.31.

      (b)  (1) The maximum length of a drift gillnet on board a vessel shall not exceed 6,000 ft (1828 m).

      (2) Up to 1,500 ft (457 m) of drift gillnet in separate panels of 600 ft (182.88 m) may be on board the vessel in a storage area.

      (c)  (1) Pacific leatherback conservation area. No person may fish with, set, or haul back drift gillnet gear in U.S. waters of the Pacific Ocean from August 15 through November 15 in the area bounded by straight lines connecting the following coordinates in the order listed:

      (i) Pt. Sur at 36°18.5′ N. lat., to

      (ii) 34°27′ N. lat. 123°35′ W. long., to

      (iii) 34°27′ N. lat. 129° W. long., to

      (iv) 45° N. lat. 129° W. long., thence to

      (v) the point where 45° N. lat. intersects the Oregon coast.

      (2)  No person may fish with, set, or haul back drift gillnet gear in U.S. waters of the Pacific Ocean east of the 120° W. meridian from June 1 through August 31 during a forecasted, or occurring, El Nino event off the coast of southern California.

      (i)  The Assistant Administrator will publish in the  a notification that an El Nino event is occurring, or is forecast to occur, off the coast of southern California and the requirement of a closure under this paragraph (c)(2). Furthermore, the Assistant Administrator will announce the requirement of such a closure by other methods as are necessary and appropriate to provide actual notice to the participants in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery.

      (ii)  The Assistant Administrator will rely on information developed by NOAA offices which monitor El Nino events, such as NOAA's Climate Prediction Center and the West Coast Office of NOAA's Coast Watch program, in order to determine whether an El Nino is forecasted or occurring for the coast of southern California. The Assistant Administrator will use the monthly sea surface temperature anomaly charts to determine whether there are warmer than normal sea surface temperatures present off of southern California during the months prior to the closure month for years in which an El Nino event has been declared by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. Specifically, the Assistant Administrator, will use sea surface temperature data from the third and second months prior to the month of the closure for determining whether El Nino conditions are present off of southern California.

      (iii)  If, during a closure as described within this paragraph (c)(2), sea surface temperatures return to normal or below normal, the Assistant Administrator may publish a  notice announcing that El Nino conditions are no longer present off the coast of southern California and may terminate the closure prior to August 31.

      (d)  The following areas off the Pacific coast are closed to driftnet gear:

      (1) Within the U.S. EEZ from the United States-Mexico International Boundary to the California-Oregon border from February 1 through April 30.

      (f)  (1) Drift gillnet vessel owners or operators are required to notify NMFS or the NMFS-designated observer provider at least 48 hours prior to departing on each fishing trip. The vessel owners or operators must communicate to the observer provider: the owner's or operator's name, contact information, vessel name, port of departure, estimated date and time of departure, and a telephone number at which the owner or operator may be contacted during the business day (Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Pacific Time) to indicate whether an observer will be required on the subject fishing trip. Contact information for the current observer provider can be obtained by calling the NMFS West Coast Region Sustainable Fisheries Division at 562-980-4025.

      (2) Drift gillnet vessel owners or operators must provide the NMFS Office of Law Enforcement for the West Coast Region (OLE) with a declaration report before the vessel leaves port to fish for thresher shark/swordfish with large-mesh drift gillnet gear in state and federal waters between 0 and 200 nautical miles offshore of California, Oregon, or Washington. Declaration reports will include: The vessel name and/or identification number, and gear type.

      (i) Upon receipt of a declaration report, OLE will provide a confirmation code or receipt to confirm that a valid declaration report was received for the vessel. Retention of the confirmation code or receipt to verify that a valid declaration report was filed and the declaration requirement was met is the responsibility of the vessel owner or operator.

      (ii) The vessel operator must send a new declaration report before leaving port on a trip during which the fishing gear that will be used is different from the gear type most recently declared for the vessel. A declaration report will be valid until another declaration report revising the existing gear declaration is received by OLE.

      (iii) OLE's declaration hotline is 1-888-585-5518. The business hours for the OLE are Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Pacific Time; voice messages left on the hotline will be retrieved at the start of the next business day.

      (g)  Drift gillnet vessel owners are required to install an OLE type-approved VMS mobile transceiver unit (VMS unit) and to arrange for a OLE type-approved communications service provider to receive and relay transmissions to the OLE prior to fishing for thresher shark/swordfish with large-mesh drift gillnet gear.

      (1)  A VMS consists of an OLE type-approved VMS unit that automatically determines the vessel's position and transmits it to an OLE type-approved communications service provider. The communications service provider receives the transmission and relays it to the OLE.

      (2)  Any vessel registered for use with both a limited-entry California state large-mesh thresher shark/swordfish drift gillnet permit and a federal highly migratory species permit that fishes in state or federal waters off the coasts of California, Oregon, or Washington (0-200 nm offshore).

      (3)

      (i) VMS unit manufacturers or communication service providers will submit products or services to the OLE for evaluation based on the published specifications.

      (ii) The OLE will publish a list of OLE type-approved VMS units and communication service providers for the DGN fishery in the  or notify the public through other appropriate media; and the OLE may publish amendments to the list as necessary.

      (4)  If you are a vessel owner that must participate in the VMS program, you or the vessel operator on your behalf must:

      (i) Obtain an OLE type-approved VMS unit and have it installed on board your vessel in accordance with the instructions provided by the OLE. You may obtain a copy of the VMS installation and operation instructions from the Special-Agent-In-Charge (SAC).

      (ii) Activate the VMS unit, submit an activation report and an initial declaration report, and receive confirmation from the OLE that the VMS transmissions are being received at least 72 hours prior to leaving port on a fishing trip for which VMS is required. Instructions for submitting an activation report may be obtained from the SAC. An activation report must again be submitted to the OLE following reinstallation of a VMS unit or change in service provider before the vessel may be used to fish in a fishery requiring the VMS.

      (A)  If you are a vessel owner who must use VMS and you are activating a VMS unit for the first time, or reactivating a VMS unit following a reinstallation or change in service provider, you or the vessel operator on your behalf must fax to the OLE an activation report that includes: vessel name, vessel owner's name, address and telephone number, vessel operator's name, address and telephone number, USCG vessel documentation number/state registration number; and, if applicable, the relevant state and federal permit numbers for which vessel or owner is registered, VMS unit manufacturer, VMS communications service provider, VMS unit identification, and a statement signed and dated by the vessel owner confirming compliance with the installation procedures provided by the SAC and identifying whether the VMS unit is primary or backup. Immediately following submission of an activation report, submit an initial declaration report as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section using the OLE's declaration hotline included in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (B)  Ownership of the VMS unit may be transferred from one vessel owner to another vessel owner if all of the following documents are provided to the OLE: a new activation report, which identifies that the VMS unit was previously registered to another vessel, a notarized bill of sale showing proof of ownership of the VMS unit, and documentation from the communications service provider showing proof that the service agreement for the previous vessel was terminated and that a service agreement was established for the new vessel.

      (iii) Continuously operate and maintain the VMS unit in good working order 24 hours a day throughout the fishing year. The VMS unit must accurately transmit a signal indicating the vessel's position at least once every hour, 24 hours a day throughout the year, unless a valid exemption report, as described in paragraph (g)(4)(iv)(F) of this section, has been confirmed by the OLE. A reduced signal transmission rate, at least once every 4 hours, may be authorized by the OLE when a vessel remains in port for an extended period of time.

      (iv) Submit an exemption report to be confirmed by the OLE as valid, as described at paragraph (g)(4)(iv)(F) of this section, and comply with all conditions and requirements of the VMS exemption identified in this section and specified in the exemption report for a vessel to be exempted from the requirement of continuously operating and maintaining the VMS unit 24 hours a day throughout the fishing year.

      (A)  When it is anticipated that a vessel will be continuously out of the water for more than 7 consecutive days and the OLE has confirmed a valid exemption report has been received for the vessel, electrical power to the VMS unit may be removed and transmissions may be discontinued. Under this exemption, VMS transmissions can be discontinued from the time the vessel is removed from the water until the time that the vessel is placed back in the water.

      (B)  When the vessel will be continuously operating seaward of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ; beyond 200 nm) off the coasts of California, Oregon, or Washington for more than 7 consecutive days and the OLE has confirmed a valid exemption report has been received for the vessel, the VMS unit transmissions may be reduced or discontinued from the time the vessel leaves the EEZ off the coasts of California, Oregon, or Washington until the time that the vessel re-enters the EEZ off the coasts of California, Oregon, or Washington. If the vessel is equipped with a VMS unit that OLE has approved for this exemption and after the OLE has received an exemption report for the vessel, the vessel owner or operator can request that the OLE reduce or discontinue the VMS transmissions.

      (C)  A vessel participating in the DGN fishery that is required to have VMS under paragraph (g) of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions after the end of the fishing season in which it fished, provided that a completed exemption report including a statement signed by the vessel owner indicating that the vessel will not be used to take and retain or possess or land swordfish taken in state or federal waters off the coasts of California, Oregon, or Washington during the upcoming fishing year is submitted to the OLE.

      (D)  Vessels required to have VMS under paragraph (g) of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions in emergency situations that are beyond the vessel owner's control, including but not limited to: fire, flooding, or extensive physical damage to critical areas of the vessel. A vessel owner may request an emergency exemption from the VMS requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section for his/her vessel by contacting the OLE and submitting the following information in writing: the reasons for seeking an exemption including any supporting documents (e.g., repair invoices, photographs showing damage to the vessel, insurance claim forms, etc.), the time period for which the exemption is requested, and the location of the vessel while the exemption is in effect. The OLE will issue a written determination granting or denying the emergency exemption request. A vessel will not be covered by the emergency exemption until the OLE issues a determination granting the exemption. If an exemption is granted, the duration of the exemption will be specified in the OLE determination.

      (E)  Long-term departure exemption reports must be signed by the vessel owner and submitted by fax or by emailing an electronic copy of the actual report to the OLE. If an emergency exemption request will be submitted, initial contact with the OLE must be made by telephone, fax or email within 24 hours from when the emergency incident occurred. All emergency exemption requests must be submitted in writing within 72 hours from when the incident occurred. Submission methods for exemption reports, except long-term departures and emergency exemption requests, may include email, facsimile, or telephone. The OLE will provide, through appropriate media, instructions to the public on submitting exemption reports. Instructions and other information needed to make exemption reports may be mailed to the vessel owner's address of record. Owners of vessels required to use the VMS who do not receive instructions by mail are responsible for contacting OLE during business hours at least 3 days before the exemption is needed to obtain information necessary for exemption reports. The OLE must be contacted during business hours (Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, between 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Pacific Time). Any other categories of exemptions that have not been specified in paragraph (g) of this section may be submitted to the OLE through the VMS unit or another method deemed appropriate by the OLE. Before a request for a new category of exemption can be approved by OLE, it must be announced in the .

      (F)  For an exemption report to be valid, the OLE must receive and confirm it at least 2 hours and not more than 24 hours before the exempted activities defined at paragraphs (g)(4)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section. An exemption report is valid until NMFS receives a report canceling the exemption. An exemption cancellation must be received at least 2 hours before the vessel re-enters the EEZ following an outside areas exemption; at least 2 hours before the vessel is placed back in the water following a haul-out exemption; or at least 2 hours before a vessel resumes fishing with a large-mesh drift gillnet after a long-term departure exemption. If a vessel is required to submit an activation report under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section before returning to fish, that report may substitute for the exemption cancellation. After an emergency situation occurs that disrupts the VMS transmission, initial contact must be made with the OLE within 24 hours and a written emergency exemption request submitted within 72 hours from when the incident occurred. If the emergency situation, upon which an emergency exemption is based, is resolved before the exemption expires, an exemption cancellation must be received by OLE at least 2 hours before the vessel resumes fishing.

      (v) When aware that transmission of automatic position reports has been interrupted, or when notified by OLE that automatic position reports are not being received, contact OLE and follow the instructions provided to you. Such instructions may include, but are not limited to, manually communicating the vessel's position to a location designated by the OLE or returning to port until the VMS unit is operable.

      (vi) After a fishing trip during which interruption of automatic position reports has occurred, the vessel's owner or operator must replace or repair the VMS unit prior to the vessel's next fishing trip. Repair or reinstallation of a VMS unit or installation of a replacement unit, including any changes in communications service providers shall be in accordance with the instructions provided by the OLE.

      (vii) Make the VMS units available for inspection by OLE personnel, USCG personnel, state enforcement personnel or any authorized officer.

      (viii) Ensure that the VMS unit is not tampered with, disabled, destroyed, operated, or maintained improperly.

      (ix) Pay all charges levied by the communication service provider as necessary to ensure continuous operation of the VMS units.

      (5)  For issues related to day-to-day operation of VMS units, including declaration reports, activation reports and exemption reports, the SAC's designee is the OLE VMS Program Manager's office located at 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115-6349; phone: (888) 585-5518; fax: (206) 526-6528); and email:

      (h)  (1) Maximum 2-year hard caps are established on the number of sea turtle and marine mammal mortalities and injuries that occur as a result of observed interactions with large-mesh drift gillnets (mesh size ≥ 14 inches) deployed by vessels registered for use under HMS permits. Mortalities and injuries during the current fishing season (May 1 through January 31) and the previous fishing season are counted towards the hard caps. The mortality and injury hard caps are as follows:

      (2) Upon determination by the Regional Administrator that, based on data from NMFS observers or a NMFS Electronic Monitoring program, the fishery has reached any of the protected species hard caps during a given 2-year period:

      (i) As soon as practicable, the Regional Administrator will file for publication at the Office of the Federal Register a notification that the fishery has reached a protected species hard cap. The notification will include an advisement that the large-mesh drift gillnet (mesh size ≥ 14 inches) fishery shall be closed, and that drift gillnet fishing in the U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone by vessels registered for use under HMS permits will be prohibited beginning at a specified date and ending at a specified date. Drift gillnet fishing will then be allowed beginning May 1 of the year when observed mortality and injury of each species during the previous two May 1 through January 31 fishing seasons is below its hard cap value. Coincidental with the filing of the notification, the Regional Administrator will also provide actual notice that the large-mesh drift gillnet (mesh size ≥ 14 inches) fishery shall be closed, and that drift gillnet fishing in the U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone by vessels registered for use under HMS permits will be prohibited beginning at a specified date, to all holders of HMS permits with a drift gillnet endorsement via VMS communication, postal mail, and a posting on the NMFS regional website.

      (ii) Beginning on the fishery closure date published in the  and indicated by the Regional Administrator in the notification provided to vessel operators and permit holders under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, and until the specified ending date, the large-mesh drift gillnet (mesh size ≥ 14 inches) fishery shall be closed. During the closure period commercial fishing vessels registered for use under HMS permits may not be used to target, retain on board, transship, or land fish captured with a large-mesh drift gillnet (mesh size ≥ 14 inches), with the exception that any fish already on board a fishing vessel on the effective date of the document may be retained on board, transshipped, and/or landed, to the extent authorized by applicable laws and regulations, provided such fish are landed within 4 days after the effective date published in the fishing closure document.

      § 660.721   Recreational fishing bag limits and filleting requirements.

#### § § 660.721

      This section applies to recreational fishing for albacore tuna in the U.S. EEZ off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington and for bluefin tuna in the U.S. EEZ off the coast of California. In addition to individual fishermen, the operator of a U.S. sportsfishing vessel that fishes for albacore or bluefin tuna is responsible for ensuring that the bag and possession limits of this section are not exceeded. The bag limits of this section apply on the basis of each 24-hour period at sea, regardless of the number of trips per day. The provisions of this section do not authorize any person to take and retain more than one daily bag limit of fish during 1 calendar day. Federal recreational HMS regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state recreational HMS regulations relating to federally-managed HMS.

      (a)  Except pursuant to a multi-day possession permit referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, a recreational fisherman may take and retain, or possess onboard no more than:

      (1) Ten albacore tuna if any part of the fishing trip occurs in the U.S. EEZ south of a line running due west true from 34°27′ N. latitude (at Point Conception, Santa Barbara County) to the U.S.-Mexico border.

      (2) Twenty-five albacore tuna if any part of the fishing trip occurs in the U.S. EEZ north of a line running due west true from 34°27′ N. latitude (at Point Conception, Santa Barbara County) to the California-Oregon border.

      (b)  A recreational fisherman may take and retain, or possess on board no more than two bluefin tuna during any part of a fishing trip that occurs in the U.S. EEZ off California south of a line running due west true from the California—Oregon border [42°00′ N. latitude].

      (c)  If the State of California requires a multi-day possession permit for albacore or bluefin tuna harvested by a recreational fishing vessel and landed in California, aggregating daily trip limits for multi-day trips would be deemed consistent with Federal law.

      (d)  Off the coast of California, boat limits apply, whereby each fisherman aboard a vessel may continue to use recreational angling gear until the combined daily limits of HMS for all licensed and juvenile anglers aboard has been attained (additional state restrictions on boat limits may apply). Unless otherwise prohibited, when two or more persons are angling for HMS species aboard a vessel in the EEZ, fishing may continue until boat limits are reached.

      (e)  South of a line running due west true from Point Conception, Santa Barbara County (34°27′ N. latitude) to the U.S.-Mexico border, any tuna that has been filleted must be individually bagged as follows:

      (1) The bag must be marked with the species' common name; and

      (2) The fish must be cut into the following six pieces with all skin attached: the four loins, the collar removed as one piece with both pectoral fins attached and intact, and the belly cut to include the vent and with both pelvic fins attached and intact.

      § 665.4   Annual catch limits.

#### § § 665.4

      (a)  For each fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall specify an annual catch limit, including any overage adjustments, for each stock or stock complex of management unit species defined in subparts B through F of this part, as recommended by the Council, and considering the best available scientific, commercial, and other information about the fishery for that stock or stock complex. The annual catch limit shall serve as the basis for invoking accountability measures in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (b)  If landings of a stock or stock complex exceed the specified annual catch limit in a fishing year, the Council will take action in accordance with 50 CFR 600.310(g), which may include recommending that the Regional Administrator reduce the annual catch limit for the subsequent year by the amount of the overage or other measures, as appropriate.

      (c)  The Regional Administrator is not required to specify an annual catch limit for an ECS, or for an MUS that is statutorily excepted from the requirement pursuant to 50 CFR 600.310(h)(1).

      (d)  For each fishing year, the Regional Administrator may also specify an annual catch target that is below the annual catch limit of a stock or stock complex, as recommended by the Council. When used, the annual catch target shall serve as the basis for invoking accountability measures in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (e)  (1) No later than 60 days before the start of a fishing year, the Council shall recommend to the Regional Administrator an annual catch limit, including any overage adjustment, for each stock or stock complex. The recommended limit should be based on a recommendation of the SSC of the acceptable biological catch for each stock or stock complex. The Council may not recommend an annual catch limit that exceeds the acceptable biological catch recommended by the SSC. The Council may also recommend an annual catch target below the annual catch limit.

      (2) No later than 30 days before the start of a fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall publish in the  a notice of the proposed annual catch limit specification and any associated annual catch target, and request public comment.

#### § § 665.124

      (a)  Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, § 665.13 applies to coral reef ecosystem permits.

      (1)  Any person of the United States fishing for, taking or retaining American Samoa coral reef ECS must have a special permit if they fish, or if a vessel which they operate is used to fish, for any:

      (i) American Samoa coral reef ECS in low-use MPAs as defined in § 665.99;

      (ii) American Samoa coral reef ECS in the coral reef ecosystem management area; or

      (iii) American Samoa coral reef ECS in the coral reef ecosystem management area with any gear not specifically allowed in this subpart.

      (2)  A receiving vessel must be registered for use with a transshipment permit if that vessel is used in the American Samoa coral reef ecosystem management area to land or transship American Samoa coral reef ECS harvested within low-use MPAs.

      (3)  The following persons are not required to have a permit under this section:

      (i) Any person issued a permit to fish under any FEP who incidentally catches American Samoa coral reef ECS while fishing for bottomfish MUS or ECS, crustacean ECS, western Pacific pelagic MUS, precious coral ECS, or seamount groundfish MUS;

      (ii) Any person fishing for American Samoa coral reef ECS outside of an MPA, who does not retain any American Samoa coral reef ECS; and

      (iii) Any person collecting marine organisms for scientific research as described in § 665.17, or § 600.745 of this chapter.

      (b)  Each permit will be valid for fishing only in the fishery management area specified on the permit.

      (c)  General requirements governing application information, issuance, fees, expiration, replacement, transfer, alteration, display, sanctions, and appeals for permits are contained in § 665.13.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator shall issue a special permit in accordance with the criteria and procedures specified in this section.

      (1)  An applicant for a special or transshipment permit issued under this section must complete and submit to the Regional Administrator, a Special Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishing Permit Application Form issued by NMFS. Information in the application form must include, but is not limited to, a statement describing the objectives of the fishing activity for which a special permit is needed, including a general description of the expected disposition of the resources harvested under the permit ( stored live, fresh, frozen, preserved; sold for food, ornamental, research, or other use; and a description of the planned fishing operation, including location of fishing and gear operation, amount and species (directed and incidental) expected to be harvested and estimated habitat and protected species impacts).

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations required under this section. An applicant will be notified of an incomplete application within 10 working days of receipt of the application. An incomplete application will not be considered until corrected and completed in writing.

      (3)  (i) If an application contains all of the required information, the Regional Administrator will forward copies of the application within 30 days to the Council, the USCG, the fishery management agency of the affected state, and other interested parties who have identified themselves to the Council, and the USFWS.

      (ii) Within 60 days following receipt of a complete application, the Regional Administrator will consult with the Council through its Executive Director, USFWS, and the Director of the affected state fishery management agency concerning the permit application and will receive their recommendations for approval or disapproval of the application based on:

      (A) Information provided by the applicant;

      (B) The current domestic annual harvesting and processing capacity of the directed and incidental species for which a special permit is being requested;

      (C) The current status of resources to be harvested in relation to the overfishing definition in the FEP;

      (D) Estimated ecosystem, habitat, and protected species impacts of the proposed activity; and

      (E) Other biological and ecological information relevant to the proposal. The applicant will be provided with an opportunity to appear in support of the application.

      (iii) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and supporting rationale, the Regional Administrator may:

      (A) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the FEP, the national standards, the Endangered Species Act, and other applicable laws, approve or deny a special permit; or

      (B) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case, written reasons will be provided by the Regional Administrator to the Council for the rejection.

      (iv) If the Regional Administrator does not receive a recommendation from the Council within 60 days of Council receipt of the permit application, the Regional Administrator can make a determination of approval or denial independently.

      (v) Within 30 working days after the consultation in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the special permit and, if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of a special permit include the following:

      (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in connection with his or her application.

      (B) According to the best scientific information available, the directed or incidental catch in the season or location specified under the permit would detrimentally affect any coral reef resource or coral reef ecosystem in a significant way, including, but not limited to issues related to, spawning grounds or seasons, protected species interactions, EFH, and habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC).

      (C) Issuance of the special permit would inequitably allocate fishing privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as its sole purpose.

      (D) The method or amount of harvest in the season and/or location stated on the permit is considered inappropriate based on previous human or natural impacts in the given area.

      (E) NMFS has determined that the maximum number of permits for a given area in a given season has been reached and allocating additional permits in the same area would be detrimental to the resource.

      (F) The activity proposed under the special permit would create a significant enforcement problem.

      (vi) The Regional Administrator may attach conditions to the special permit, if it is granted, consistent with the management objectives of the FEP, including, but not limited to: (A) The maximum amount of each resource that can be harvested and landed during the term of the special permit, including trip limits, where appropriate.

      (B) The times and places where fishing may be conducted.

      (C) The type, size, and amount of gear which may be used by each vessel operated under the special permit.

      (D) Data reporting requirements.

      (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the purposes of the special permit consistent with the objectives of the FEP.

      (4)  (i) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit or a permit affecting their interests to the Regional Administrator. In order to be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons therefore, and must be submitted within 30 days of the original action(s) by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (ii) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder, as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will rule on the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in this section and the FEP, as appropriate, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefore, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (iii) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing in the  Such a hearing shall normally be held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the  unless the hearing officer extends the time for reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested parties, may appear personally and/or be represented by counsel at the hearing and may submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (iv) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's action constitutes final action for the agency for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.

      (5) The Regional Administrator may, for good cause, extend any time limit prescribed in this section for a period not to exceed 30 days either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the Council, appellant or applicant stating the reason(s) therefore.

      § 665.203   Permits.

#### § § 665.203

      (a) —(1)  The owner of any vessel used to fish for, land, or transship Hawaii bottomfish MUS or ECS shoreward of the outer boundary of the NWHI subarea must have a permit issued under this section, and the permit must be registered for use with that vessel. PIRO will not register a single vessel for use with a Ho'omalu Zone permit and a Mau Zone permit at the same time. Mau Zone permits issued before June 14, 1999, became invalid June 14, 1999, except that a permit issued to a person who submitted a timely application under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is valid until the permit holder either receives a Mau Zone limited entry permit or until final agency action is taken on the permit holder's application. The Ho'omalu Zone and the Mau Zone limited entry systems described in this section are subject to abolition, modification, or additional effort limitation programs.

      (2)  The owner of a vessel that is used for and any person who participates in non-commercial, vessel-based fishing, landing, or transshipment of Hawaii bottomfish MUS or ECS in the MHI management subarea is required to obtain an MHI non-commercial bottomfish permit or a State of Hawaii Commercial Marine License. If one or more persons on a vessel-based bottomfish fishing trip holds an MHI non-commercial permit, then the entire trip is considered non-commercial, and not commercial. However, if any commercial fishing occurs during or as a result of a vessel-based fishing trip, then the fishing trip is considered commercial, and not non-commercial. Charter boat customers are not subject to the requirements of the section.

      (b)  (1) An application for a permit required under this section must be submitted to PIRO as described in § 665.13.

      (2) Ho'omalu Zone limited access permit. In addition to an application under § 665.13(c), each applicant for a Ho'omalu Zone permit must also submit a supplementary information sheet provided by PIRO, which must be signed by the vessel owner or a designee and include the following information:

      (i) The qualification criterion that the applicant believes he or she meets for issuance of a limited access permit;

      (ii) A copy of landings receipts or other documentation, with a certification from a state or Federal agency that this information is accurate, to demonstrate participation in the NWHI bottomfish fishery; and

      (iii) If the application is filed by a partnership or corporation, the names of each of the individual partners or shareholders and their respective percentages of ownership of the partnership or corporation.

      (3) Mau Zone limited access permit. PIRO will not accept applications for a new Mau Zone permit after June 14, 1999. In addition to an application under § 665.13(c), each applicant for a Mau Zone permit must also submit a supplementary information sheet provided by PIRO, which must be signed by the vessel owner or a designee and include the following information:

      (i) The qualification criterion that the applicant believes he or she meets for issuance of a limited access permit;

      (ii) Copy of State of Hawaii catch report(s) to demonstrate that the permitted vessel had made qualifying landings of bottomfish from the Mau Zone; and

      (iii) If the application is filed by a partnership or corporation, the names of each of the individual partners or shareholders and their respective percentage of ownership of the partnership or corporation.

      (c) Sale or transfer of Ho'omalu limited access permits to new vessel owners.

      (1) A Ho'omalu zone permit may not be sold or otherwise transferred to a new owner.

      (2) A Ho'omalu zone permit or permits may be held by a partnership or corporation. If 50 percent or more of the ownership of the vessel passes to persons other than those listed in the original application, the permit will lapse and must be surrendered to the Regional Administrator.

      (d) Transfer of Ho'omalu Zone limited access permits to replacement vessels.

      (1) Upon application by the owner of a permitted vessel, the Regional Administrator will transfer that owner's permit to a replacement vessel owned by that owner, provided that the replacement vessel does not exceed 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA. The replacement vessel must be put into service no later than 12 months after the owner applies for the transfer, or the transfer shall be void.

      (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may apply to the Regional Administrator for transfer of that owner's permit to a replacement vessel greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA. The Regional Administrator may transfer the permit upon determining, after consultation with the Council and considering the objectives of the limited access program, that the replacement vessel has catching power that is comparable to the rest of the vessels holding permits for the fishery, or has catching power that does not exceed that of the original vessel, and that the transfer is not inconsistent with the objectives of the program. The Regional Administrator shall consider vessel length, range, hold capacity, gear limitations, and other appropriate factors in making determinations of catching power equivalency and comparability of the catching power of vessels in the fishery.

      (e) Ho'omalu Zone limited access permit renewal.

      (1) A qualifying landing for Ho'omalu Zone permit renewal is a landing of at least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) of Hawaii bottomfish MUS or ECS from the Ho'omalu Zone or a landing of at least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) of fish from the Ho'omalu Zone, of which at least 50 percent by weight was Hawaii bottomfish MUS or ECS. A permit is eligible for renewal for the next calendar year if the vessel covered by the permit made three or more qualifying landings during the current calendar year.

      (2) The owner of a permitted vessel that did not make three or more qualifying landings of bottomfish in a year may apply to the Regional Administrator for a waiver of the landing requirement. If the Regional Administrator finds that failure to make three landings was due to circumstances beyond the owner's control, the Regional Administrator may renew the permit. A waiver may not be granted if the failure to make three landings was due to general economic conditions or market conditions, such that the vessel operations would not be profitable.

      (f) Issuance of new Ho'omalu Zone limited access permits. The Regional Administrator may issue new Ho'omalu Zone limited access permits under § 665.13 if the Regional Administrator determines, in consultation with the Council, that bottomfish stocks in the Ho'omalu Zone are able to support additional fishing effort.

      (g) Eligibility for new Ho'omalu Zone limited access permits. When the Regional Administrator has determined that new permits may be issued, they shall be issued to applicants based upon eligibility, determined as follows:

      (1)  (i) Two points will be assigned for each year in which the applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that made three or more of any of the following types of landings in the NWHI:

      (A) Any amount of Hawaii bottomfish MUS, regardless of weight, if made on or before August 7, 1985;

      (B) At least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) of Hawaii bottomfish MUS, if made after August 7, 1985; or

      (C) At least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) of any fish lawfully harvested from the NWHI, of which at least 50 percent by weight was bottomfish, if made after August 7, 1985.

      (ii) One point will be assigned for each year in which the applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that landed at least 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) of bottomfish from the MHI.

      (iii) For any one year, points will be assigned under either paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, but not under both paragraphs.

      (iv) Before the Regional Administrator issues a Ho'omalu zone permit to fish for bottomfish under this section, the primary operator and relief operator named on the application form must have completed a protected species workshop conducted by NMFS.

      (2)  An applicant must own at least a 25 percent share in the vessel that the permit would cover, and only one permit will be assigned to any vessel.

      (3)  New permits shall be awarded to applicants in descending order, starting with the applicant with the largest number of points. If two or more persons have an equal number of points, and there are insufficient new permits for all such applicants, the new permits shall be awarded by the Regional Administrator through a lottery.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator shall place a notice in the  and shall use other means to notify prospective applicants of the opportunity to file applications for new permits under this program.

      (h) Eligibility for new Mau Zone limited access permits.

      (1) PIRO will issue an initial Mau Zone permit to a vessel owner who qualifies for at least three points under the following point system:

      (i) An owner who held a Mau Zone permit on or before December 17, 1991, and whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS on or before December 17, 1991, shall be assigned 1.5 points.

      (ii) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1991 shall be assigned 0.5 point.

      (iii) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1992 shall be assigned 1.0 point.

      (iv) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1993 shall be assigned 1.5 points.

      (v) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1994 shall be assigned 2.0 points.

      (vi) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1995 shall be assigned 2.5 points.

      (vii) An owner whose permitted vessel made at least one qualifying landing of Hawaii bottomfish MUS during 1996 shall be assigned 3.0 points.

      (viii) Before PIRO issues a Mau Zone permit to fish for bottomfish under this section, the primary operator and relief operator named on the application form must have completed a protected species workshop conducted by NMFS.

      (2) For purposes of this paragraph (h), a “qualifying landing” means any amount of Hawaii bottomfish MUS lawfully harvested from the Mau Zone and offloaded for sale. No points shall be assigned to an owner for any qualifying landings reported to the State of Hawaii more than 1 year after the landing.

      (3) More than one Mau Zone permit may be issued to an owner of two or more vessels, provided each of the owner's vessels for which a permit will be registered for use has made the required qualifying landings for the owner to be assigned at least three eligibility points.

      (4) A Mau Zone permit holder who does not own a vessel at the time initial permits are issued must register the permit for use with a vessel owned by the permit holder within 12 months from the date the permit was issued. In the interim, the permit holder may register the permit for use with a leased or chartered vessel. If within 12 months of initial permit issuance, the permit holder fails to apply to PIRO to register the permit for use with a vessel owned by the permit holder, then the permit shall expire.

      (5) For each of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(viii) of this section, PIRO shall assign points based on the landings of one permitted vessel to only one owner if the vessel did not have multiple owners during the time frame covered by the subordinate paragraphs. If a vessel had multiple owners during a time frame covered by any of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(viii) of this section (including joint owners, partners, or shareholders of a corporate owner), PIRO will assign the points for that subordinate paragraph to a single owner if only one owner submits an application with respect to the landings of that vessel during that time frame. If multiple owners submit separate applications with respect to the same landings of the same vessel during the same time frame, then PIRO shall:

      (i) Adhere to any written agreement between the applicants with respect to who among them shall be assigned the aggregate point(s) generated by landings during such time frame(s), or

      (ii) If there is no agreement:

      (A) Shall issue the applicants a joint permit provided the vessel's landings during such time frames generated at least three points, or

      (B) In the event the vessel's landings during such time frame(s) generated less than three points, shall not assign any points generated by the vessel's landings during such time frame(s).

      (i) Ownership requirements and registration of Mau Zone limited access permits for use with other vessels.

      (1) A Mau Zone permit may be held by an individual, partnership, or corporation. No more than 49 percent of the underlying ownership interest in a Mau Zone permit may be sold, leased, chartered, or otherwise transferred to another person or entity. If more than 49 percent of the underlying ownership of the permit passes to persons or entities other than those listed in the original permit application supplemental information sheet, then the permit expires and must be surrendered to PIRO.

      (2) A Mau Zone permit holder may apply under § 665.13 to PIRO to register the permit for use with another vessel if that vessel is owned by the permit holder, and is no longer than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA.

      (3) If a Mau Zone permit holder sells the vessel for which the permit is registered for use, the permit holder must, within 12 months of the date of sale, apply to PIRO to register the permit for use with a vessel owned by the permit holder. If the permit holder has not applied to register a replacement vessel within 12 months, then the permit expires.

      (4) If a permitted vessel owned by the permit holder is sold or becomes unseaworthy, the Mau Zone permit with which the vessel was registered may be registered for use with a leased or chartered vessel for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date of registration of the leased or chartered vessel. If by the end of that 12-month period the permit holder fails to apply to PIRO to register the permit for use with a vessel owned by the permit holder, then the permit expires.

      (j) Mau Zone limited access permit renewal.

      (1) A Mau Zone permit will be eligible for renewal if the vessel for which the permit is registered for use made at least five separate fishing trips with landings of at least 500 lb (227 kg) of Hawaii bottomfish MUS or ECS per trip during the calendar year. Only one landing of bottomfish MUS or ECS per fishing trip to the Mau Zone will be counted toward the landing requirement.

      (2) If the vessel for which the permit is registered for use fails to meet the landing requirement of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the owner may apply to the Regional Administrator for a waiver of the landing requirement. Grounds for a waiver are limited to captain incapacitation, vessel breakdowns, and the loss of the vessel at sea if the event prevented the vessel from meeting the landing requirement. Unprofitability is not sufficient for waiver of the landing requirement.

      (3) Failure of the permit holder to register a vessel for use under the permit does not exempt a permit holder from the requirements specified in this paragraph.

      (k) Appeals of permit actions.

      (1) Except as provided in subpart A of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may appeal the granting, denial, or revocation of his or her permit to the Regional Administrator.

      (2) In order to be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing, must state the action appealed, and the reasons therefore, and must be submitted within 30 days of the appealed action. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (3) The Regional Administrator, in consultation with the Council, will decide the appeal in accordance with the FEP and implementing regulations and based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council, the summary record kept of any hearing, the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and any other relevant information.

      (4) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose. The applicant or permit holder may appear personally and/or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (5) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. The Regional Administrator's decision on the application is the final administrative decision of the Department of Commerce, and is effective on the date the Administrator signs the decision.

      § 665.224   Permits and fees.

#### § § 665.224

      (a)  Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, § 665.13 applies to Hawaii coral reef ecosystem permits.

      (1)  Any person of the United States fishing for, taking or retaining Hawaii coral reef ECS must have a special permit if they, or a vessel which they operate, is used to fish for any:

      (i) Hawaii coral reef ECS in low-use MPAs as defined in § 665.199;

      (ii) Hawaii coral reef ECS in the coral reef ecosystem management area; or

      (iii) Hawaii coral reef ECS in the coral reef ecosystem management area with any gear not specifically allowed in this subpart.

      (2)  A receiving vessel must be registered for use with a transshipment permit if that vessel is used in the Hawaii coral reef ecosystem management area to land or transship Hawaii coral reef ECS harvested within low-use MPAs.

      (3)  The following persons are not required to have a permit under this section:

      (i) Any person issued a permit to fish under any FEP who incidentally catches Hawaii coral reef ECS while fishing for bottomfish MUS or ECS, crustacean MUS, western Pacific pelagic MUS, precious corals, or seamount groundfish;

      (ii) Any person fishing for Hawaii coral reef ECS outside of an MPA, who does not retain any Hawaii coral reef ECS; and

      (iii) Any person collecting marine organisms for scientific research as described in § 665.17, or § 600.745 of this chapter.

      (b)  Each permit will be valid for fishing only in the fishery management area specified on the permit.

      (c)  General requirements governing application information, issuance, fees, expiration, replacement, transfer, alteration, display, sanctions, and appeals for permits are contained in § 665.13.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator shall issue a special permit in accordance with the criteria and procedures specified in this section.

      (1)  An applicant for a special or transshipment permit issued under this section must complete and submit to the Regional Administrator a Special Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishing Permit Application Form issued by NMFS. Information in the application form must include, but is not limited to a statement describing the objectives of the fishing activity for which a special permit is needed, including a general description of the expected disposition of the resources harvested under the permit ( stored live, fresh, frozen, preserved, sold for food, ornamental, research, or other use, and a description of the planned fishing operation, including location of fishing and gear operation, amount and species (directed and incidental) expected to be harvested and estimated habitat and protected species impacts).

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations required under this section. An applicant will be notified of an incomplete application within 10 working days of receipt of the application. An incomplete application will not be considered until corrected in writing.

      (3)  (i) If an application contains all of the required information, the Regional Administrator will forward copies of the application within 30 days to the Council, the USCG, the fishery management agency of the affected state, and other interested parties who have identified themselves to the Council, and the USFWS.

      (ii) Within 60 days following receipt of a complete application, the Regional Administrator will consult with the Council through its Executive Director, USFWS, and the Director of the affected state fishery management agency concerning the permit application and will receive their recommendations for approval or disapproval of the application based on:

      (A) Information provided by the applicant;

      (B) The current domestic annual harvesting and processing capacity of the directed and incidental species for which a special permit is being requested;

      (C) The current status of resources to be harvested in relation to the overfishing definition in the FEP;

      (D) Estimated ecosystem, habitat, and protected species impacts of the proposed activity; and

      (E) Other biological and ecological information relevant to the proposal. The applicant will be provided with an opportunity to appear in support of the application.

      (iii) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and supporting rationale, the Regional Administrator may:

      (A) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the FEP, the national standards, the Endangered Species Act, and other applicable laws, approve or deny a special permit; or

      (B) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case, written reasons will be provided by the Regional Administrator to the Council for the rejection.

      (iv) If the Regional Administrator does not receive a recommendation from the Council within 60 days of Council receipt of the permit application, the Regional Administrator can make a determination of approval or denial independently.

      (v) Within 30 working days after the consultation in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the special permit and, if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of a special permit include the following:

      (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in connection with his or her application.

      (B) According to the best scientific information available, the directed or incidental catch in the season or location specified under the permit would detrimentally affect any coral reef resource or coral reef ecosystem in a significant way, including, but not limited to, issues related to spawning grounds or seasons, protected species interactions, EFH, and habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC).

      (C) Issuance of the special permit would inequitably allocate fishing privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as its sole purpose.

      (D) The method or amount of harvest in the season and/or location stated on the permit is considered inappropriate based on previous human or natural impacts in the given area.

      (E) NMFS has determined that the maximum number of permits for a given area in a given season has been reached and allocating additional permits in the same area would be detrimental to the resource.

      (F) The activity proposed under the special permit would create a significant enforcement problem.

      (vi) The Regional Administrator may attach conditions to the special permit, if it is granted, consistent with the management objectives of the FEP, including, but not limited to:

      (A) The maximum amount of each resource that can be harvested and landed during the term of the special permit, including trip limits, where appropriate.

      (B) The times and places where fishing may be conducted.

      (C) The type, size, and amount of gear which may be used by each vessel operated under the special permit.

      (D) Data reporting requirements.

      (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the purposes of the special permit consistent with the objectives of the FEP.

      (4)  (i) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit or a permit affecting their interests to the Regional Administrator. In order to be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons therefore, and must be submitted within 30 days of the original action(s) by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (ii) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will rule on the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in this section and the FEP, as appropriate, based on information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefore, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (iii) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing in the  Such a hearing shall normally be held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the  unless the hearing officer extends the time for reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested parties, may appear personally and/or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (iv) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's action constitutes final action for the agency for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.

      (5) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for good cause, for a period not to exceed 30 days, by the Regional Administrator, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the Council, appellant or applicant stating the reason(s) therefore.

If there are insufficient permits for all such applicants, the new permits shall be issued by the Regional Administrator through a lottery.

      (ii) Second priority to receive limited access permits under paragraph (g) goes to owners with the most points, based upon a point system. If two or more owners have the same number of points and there are insufficient permits for all such owners, the Regional Administrator shall issue the permits through a lottery. Under the point system, limited access permits will be issued, in descending order, beginning with owners who have the most points and proceeding to owners who have the least points, based on the following:

      (A) Three points shall be assigned for each calendar year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the operator of a vessel that was used to land lobster from Permit Area 1.

      (B) Two points shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, or crew member of a vessel engaged in either commercial fishing in Permit Area 2 for lobster, or fishing in Permit Area 1 for fish other than lobster with an intention to sell all or part of the catch.

      (C) One point shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, or crew member of a vessel engaged in any other commercial fishing in the EEZ surrounding Hawaii.

      (5) A holder of a new limited access permit must own at least a 50 percent share in the vessel that the permit would cover.

#### § § 665.424

      (a)  Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, § 665.13 applies to coral reef ecosystem permits.

      (1)  Any person of the United States fishing for, taking or retaining Mariana coral reef ECS must have a special permit if they, or a vessel which they operate, is used to fish for any:

      (i) Mariana coral reef ecosystem MUS ECS in low-use MPAs as defined in § 665.399;

      (ii) Mariana coral reef ECS in the coral reef ecosystem management area; or

      (iii) Mariana coral reef ECS in the Mariana coral reef ecosystem management area with any gear not specifically allowed in this subpart.

      (2)  A receiving vessel must be registered for use with a transshipment permit if that vessel is used in the Mariana coral reef ecosystem management area to land or transship any Mariana coral reef ECS harvested within low-use MPAs.

      (3)  The following persons are not required to have a permit under this section:

      (i) Any person issued a permit to fish under any FEP who incidentally catches Mariana coral reef ECS while fishing for bottomfish MUS or ECS, crustacean ECS, western Pacific pelagic MUS, precious coral ECS, or seamount groundfish MUS.

      (ii) Any person fishing for Mariana coral reef ECS outside of an MPA, who does not retain any Mariana coral reef ECS.

      (iii) Any person collecting marine organisms for scientific research as described in § 665.17, or § 600.745 of this chapter.

      (b)  Each permit will be valid for fishing only in the fishery management area specified on the permit.

      (c)  General requirements governing application information, issuance, fees, expiration, replacement, transfer, alteration, display, sanctions, and appeals for permits are contained in § 665.13.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator shall issue a special permit in accordance with the criteria and procedures specified in this section.

      (1)  An applicant for a special or transshipment permit issued under this section must complete, and submit to the Regional Administrator, a Special Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishing Permit Application Form issued by NMFS. Information in the application form must include, but is not limited to, a statement describing the objectives of the fishing activity for which a special permit is needed, including a general description of the expected disposition of the resources harvested under the permit (, stored live, fresh, frozen, preserved; sold for food, ornamental, research, or other use; and a description of the planned fishing operation, including location of fishing and gear operation, amount and species (directed and incidental) expected to be harvested and estimated habitat and protected species impacts).

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations required under this section. An applicant will be notified of an incomplete application within 10 working days of receipt of the application. An incomplete application will not be considered until corrected and completed in writing.

      (3)  (i) If an application contains all of the required information, the Regional Administrator will forward copies of the application within 30 days to the Council, the USCG, the fishery management agency of the affected state, and other interested parties who have identified themselves to the Council, and the USFWS.

      (ii) Within 60 days following receipt of a complete application, the Regional Administrator will consult with the Council through its Executive Director, USFWS, and the Director of the affected state fishery management agency concerning the permit application, and will receive their recommendations for approval or disapproval of the application based on:

      (A) Information provided by the applicant;

      (B) The current domestic annual harvesting and processing capacity of the directed and incidental species for which a special permit is being requested;

      (C) The current status of resources to be harvested in relation to the overfishing definition in the FEP;

      (D) Estimated ecosystem, habitat, and protected species impacts of the proposed activity; and

      (E) Other biological and ecological information relevant to the proposal. The applicant will be provided with an opportunity to appear in support of the application.

      (iii) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and supporting rationale, the Regional Administrator may:

      (A) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the FEP, the national standards, the Endangered Species Act, and other applicable laws, approve or deny a special permit; or

      (B) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case, written reasons will be provided by the Regional Administrator to the Council for the rejection.

      (iv) If the Regional Administrator does not receive a recommendation from the Council within 60 days of Council receipt of the permit application, the Regional Administrator can make a determination of approval or denial independently.

      (v) Within 30 working days after the consultation in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the special permit and, if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of a special permit include the following:

      (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in connection with his or her application.

      (B) According to the best scientific information available, the directed or incidental catch in the season or location specified under the permit would detrimentally affect any coral reef resource or coral reef ecosystem in a significant way, including, but not limited to, issues related to spawning grounds or seasons, protected species interactions, EFH, and habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC).

      (C) Issuance of the special permit would inequitably allocate fishing privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as its sole purpose.

      (D) The method or amount of harvest in the season and/or location stated on the permit is considered inappropriate based on previous human or natural impacts in the given area.

      (E) NMFS has determined that the maximum number of permits for a given area in a given season has been reached and allocating additional permits in the same area would be detrimental to the resource.

      (F) The activity proposed under the special permit would create a significant enforcement problem.

      (vi) The Regional Administrator may attach conditions to the special permit, if it is granted, consistent with the management objectives of the FEP, including, but not limited to:

      (A) The maximum amount of each resource that can be harvested and landed during the term of the special permit, including trip limits, where appropriate.

      (B) The times and places where fishing may be conducted.

      (C) The type, size, and amount of gear which may be used by each vessel operated under the special permit.

      (D) Data reporting requirements.

      (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the purposes of the special permit consistent with the objectives of the FEP.

      (4) Appeals of permit actions.

      (i) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit or a permit affecting their interests to the Regional Administrator. In order to be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons therefore, and must be submitted within 30 days of the original action(s) by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (ii) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will rule on the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in this section and the FEP, as appropriate, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefore, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (iii) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing in the  Such a hearing shall normally be held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the  unless the hearing officer extends the time for reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested parties, may appear personally and/or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (iv) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's action constitutes final action for the agency for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.

      (5) The Regional Administrator may extend, for good cause, any time limit prescribed in this section for a period not to exceed 30 days, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the Council, appellant or applicant stating the reason(s) therefore.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator shall issue a special permit in accordance with the criteria and procedures specified in this section.

      (1)  An applicant for a special or transshipment permit issued under this section must complete and submit to the Regional Administrator a Special Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishing Permit Application Form issued by NMFS. Information in the application form must include, but is not limited to, a statement describing the objectives of the fishing activity for which a special permit is needed, including a general description of the expected disposition of the resources harvested under the permit ( stored live, fresh, frozen, preserved; sold for food, ornamental, research, or other use; and a description of the planned fishing operation, including location of fishing and gear operation, amount and species (directed and incidental) expected to be harvested and estimated habitat and protected species impacts).

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations required under this section. An applicant will be notified of an incomplete application within 10 working days of receipt of the application. An incomplete application will not be considered until corrected and completed in writing.

      (3)  (i) If an application contains all of the required information, the Regional Administrator will forward copies of the application within 30 days to the Council, the USCG, the fishery management agency of the affected state, and other interested parties who have identified themselves to the Council, and the USFWS.

      (ii) Within 60 days following receipt of a complete application, the Regional Administrator will consult with the Council through its Executive Director, USFWS, and the Director of the affected state fishery management agency concerning the permit application and will receive their recommendations for approval or disapproval of the application based on:

      (A) Information provided by the applicant;

      (B) The current domestic annual harvesting and processing capacity of the directed and incidental species for which a special permit is being requested;

      (C) The current status of resources to be harvested in relation to the overfishing definition in the FEP;

      (D) Estimated ecosystem, habitat, and protected species impacts of the proposed activity; and

      (E) Other biological and ecological information relevant to the proposal. The applicant will be provided with an opportunity to appear in support of the application.

      (iii) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and supporting rationale, the Regional Administrator may:

      (A) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the FEP, the national standards, the Endangered Species Act, and other applicable laws, approve or deny a special permit; or

      (B) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case, written reasons will be provided by the Regional Administrator to the Council for the rejection.

      (iv) If the Regional Administrator does not receive a recommendation from the Council within 60 days of Council receipt of the permit application, the Regional Administrator can make a determination of approval or denial independently.

      (v) Within 30 working days after the consultation in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the special permit and, if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of a special permit include the following:

      (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in connection with his or her application.

      (B) According to the best scientific information available, the directed or incidental catch in the season or location specified under the permit would detrimentally affect any coral reef resource or coral reef ecosystem in a significant way, including, but not limited to issues related to, spawning grounds or seasons, protected species interactions, EFH, and habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC).

      (C) Issuance of the special permit would inequitably allocate fishing privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as its sole purpose.

      (D) The method or amount of harvest in the season and/or location stated on the permit is considered inappropriate based on previous human or natural impacts in the given area.

      (E) NMFS has determined that the maximum number of permits for a given area in a given season has been reached and allocating additional permits in the same area would be detrimental to the resource.

      (F) The activity proposed under the special permit would create a significant enforcement problem.

      (vi) The Regional Administrator may attach conditions to the special permit, if it is granted, consistent with the management objectives of the FEP, including but not limited to:

      (A) The maximum amount of each resource that can be harvested and landed during the term of the special permit, including trip limits, where appropriate.

      (B) The times and places where fishing may be conducted.

      (C) The type, size, and amount of gear which may be used by each vessel operated under the special permit.

      (D) Data reporting requirements.

      (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the purposes of the special permit consistent with the objectives of the FEP.

      (4) Appeals of permit actions.

      (i) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit or a permit affecting their interests to the Regional Administrator. In order to be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons therefore, and must be submitted within 30 days of the original action(s) by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

      (ii) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will rule on the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in this section and the FEP, as appropriate, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

      (iii) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing in the  Such a hearing shall normally be held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the  unless the hearing officer extends the time for reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested parties, may appear personally and/or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

      (iv) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator shall notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's action constitutes final action for the agency for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.

      (5) The Regional Administrator may, for good cause, extend any time limit prescribed in this section for a period not to exceed 30 days, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the Council, appellant or applicant stating the reason(s) therefore.

      § 665.807   Exemptions for Hawaii longline fishing prohibited areas; procedures.

#### § § 665.807

      (a) An exemption permitting a person to use longline gear to fish in a portion(s) of the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area will be issued to a person who can document that he or she:

      (1) Currently owns a Hawaii longline limited access permit issued under this part and registered for use with his or her vessel;

      (2) Before 1970, was the owner or operator of a vessel when that vessel landed western Pacific pelagic MUS taken on longline gear in an area that is now within the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area;

      (3) Was the owner or operator of a vessel that landed western Pacific pelagic MUS taken on longline gear in an area that is now within the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area, in at least 5 calendar years after 1969, which need not be consecutive; and

      (4) In any one of the 5 calendar years, was the owner or operator of a vessel that harvested at least 80 percent of its total landings, by weight, of longline-caught western Pacific pelagic MUS in an area that is now in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area.

      (b) Each exemption shall specify the portion(s) of the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area, bounded by longitudinal and latitudinal lines drawn to include each statistical area, as appearing on Hawaii State Commercial Fisheries Charts, in which the exemption holder made the harvest documented for the exemption application under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      (c) Each exemption is valid only within the portion(s) of the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area specified on the exemption.

      (d) A person seeking an exemption under this section must submit an application and supporting documentation to PIRO at least 15 days before the desired effective date of the exemption.

      (e) If the Regional Administrator determines that a gear conflict has occurred and is likely to occur again in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area between a vessel used by a person holding an exemption under this section and a non-longline vessel, the Regional Administrator may prohibit all longline fishing in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area around the island where the conflict occurred, or in portions thereof, upon notice to each holder of an exemption who would be affected by such a prohibition.

      (f) The Council will consider information provided by persons with Hawaii longline limited access permits issued under this part who believe they have experienced extreme financial hardship resulting from the Hawaii longline area closure, and will consider recommendations of the Pelagic Advisory Review Board to assess whether exemptions under this section should continue to be allowed, and, if appropriate, revise the qualifying criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to permit additional exemptions.

      (1) If additional exemptions are needed, the Council will advise the Regional Administrator in writing of its recommendation, including criteria by which financial hardships will be mitigated, while retaining the effectiveness of the longline fishing prohibited area.

      (2) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and supporting rationale, the Regional Administrator may:

      (i) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case written reasons will be provided by the Regional Administrator to the Council for the rejection; or

      (ii) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Pelagics FEP, the national standards, and other applicable law, initiate rulemaking to implement the Council's recommendations.

      § 665.808   Conditions for at-sea observer coverage.

#### § § 665.808

      (a) NMFS shall advise the permit holder or the designated agent of any observer requirement at least 24 hours (not including weekends and Federal holidays) before any trip for which NMFS received timely notice in compliance with these regulations.

      (b) The “Notice Prior to Fishing Trip” requirements in this subpart commit the permit holder to the representations in the notice. The notice can be modified by the permit holder or designated agent because of changed circumstance, if the Regional Administrator is promptly provided a modification to the notice that complies with the notice requirements. The notice will also be considered modified if the Regional Administrator and the permit holder or designated agent agrees to placement changes.

      (c) When NMFS notifies the permit holder or designated agent of the obligation to carry an observer in response to a notification under this subpart, or as a condition of an EFP issued under § 665.17, the vessel may not engage in the fishery without taking the observer.

      (d) A NMFS observer shall arrive at the observer's assigned vessel 30 minutes before the time designated for departure in the notice or the notice as modified, and will wait 1 hour for departure.

      (e) A permit holder must accommodate a NMFS observer assigned under these regulations. The Regional Administrator's office, and not the observer, will address any concerns raised over accommodations.

      (f) The permit holder, vessel operator, and crew must cooperate with the observer in the performance of the observer's duties, including:

      (1) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer.

      (2) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel necessary to conduct observer duties.

      (3) Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and navigation equipment as necessary to perform observer duties.

      (4) Allowing the observer access to VMS units to verify operation, obtain data, and use the communication capabilities of the units for official purposes.

      (5) Providing accurate vessel locations by latitude and longitude or loran coordinates, upon request by the observer.

      (6) Providing sea turtle, marine mammal, or seabird specimens as requested.

      (7) Notifying the observer in a timely fashion when commercial fishing operations are to begin and end.

      (g) The permit holder, operator, and crew must comply with other terms and conditions to ensure the effective deployment and use of observers that the Regional Administrator imposes by written notice.

      (h) The permit holder must ensure that assigned observers are provided living quarters comparable to crew members and are provided the same meals, snacks, and amenities as are normally provided to other vessel personnel. A mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable if a regular bunk is provided to any crew member, unless other arrangements are approved in advance by the Regional Administrator.

      (i) Reimbursement requirements are as follows:

      (1) Upon observer verification of vessel accommodations and the number of assigned days on board, NMFS will reimburse vessel owners a reasonable amount for observer subsistence as determined by the Regional Administrator.

      (2) If requested and properly documented, NMFS will reimburse the vessel owner for the following:

      (i) Communications charges incurred by the observer.

      (ii) Lost fishing time arising from a seriously injured or seriously ill observer, provided that notification of the nature of the emergency is transmitted to the Observer Program, NMFS (see address for PIRO Regional Administrator) at the earliest practical time. NMFS will reimburse the owner only for those days during which the vessel is unable to fish as a direct result of helping the NMFS employee who is seriously injured or seriously ill. Lost fishing time is based on time traveling to and from the fishing grounds and any documented out-of-pocket expenses for medical services. Payment will be based on the current target fish market prices and that vessel's average target fish catch retained per day at sea for the previous 2 years, but shall not exceed $5,000 per day or $20,000 per claim. Detailed billing with receipts and supporting records are required for allowable communication and lost fishing time claims. The claim must be completed in ink, showing the claimant's printed name, address, vessel name, observer name, trip dates, days observer was on board, an explanation of the charges, and claimant's dated signature with a statement verifying the claim to be true and correct. Requested reimbursement claims must be submitted to the Fisheries Observer Branch, Pacific Islands Region, NMFS. NMFS will not process reimbursement invoices and documentation submitted more than 120 days after the occurrence.

      (j) If a vessel normally has cabins for crew members, female observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be accommodated either in a single person cabin or, if NMFS concludes that adequate privacy can be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a two-person shared cabin. If the vessel normally does not have cabins for crew members, alternative accommodations must be approved by NMFS. If a cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the observer, or if no cabin is assigned, then arrangements for sharing common facilities must be established and approved in advance by NMFS.

      (3) Other longline vessels with freeboards of 3 ft (0.91 m) or less. Any owner or operator of a longline vessel with a permit issued under § 665.801 other than a Hawaii limited access longline permit and that has a freeboard of 3 ft (0.91 m) or less must carry aboard their vessels line clippers capable of cutting the vessels fishing line or leader within approximately 1 ft (0.3 m) of the eye of an embedded hook, as well as wire or bolt cutters capable of cutting through the vessel's hooks.

      (4) Handline, troll, pole-and-line, and other vessels using hooks other than longline vessels. Any owner or operator of a vessel fishing under the Pelagics FEP with hooks other than longline gear are not required to carry specific mitigation gear, but must comply with the handling requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (5)  Line clippers are intended to cut fishing line as close as possible to hooked or entangled sea turtles. NMFS has established minimum design standards for line clippers. The Arceneaux line clipper (ALC) is a model line clipper that meets these minimum design standards and may be fabricated from readily available and low-cost materials (see Figure 3 to this part). The minimum design standards are as follows:

      (i) A protected cutting blade. The cutting blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a holder, or otherwise afforded some protection to minimize direct contact of the cutting surface with sea turtles or users of the cutting blade.

      (ii) Cutting blade edge. The blade must be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm monofilament line and nylon or polypropylene multistrand material commonly known as braided mainline or tarred mainline.

      (iii) An extended reach holder for the cutting blade. The line clipper must have an extended reach handle or pole of at least 6 ft (1.82 m).

      (iv) Secure fastener. The cutting blade must be securely fastened to the extended reach handle or pole to ensure effective deployment and use.

      (6)  Dip nets are intended to facilitate safe handling of sea turtles and access to sea turtles for purposes of cutting lines in a manner that minimizes injury and trauma to sea turtles. The minimum design standards for dip nets that meet the requirements of this section nets are:

      (i) An extended reach handle. The dip net must have an extended reach handle of at least 6 ft (1.82 m) of wood or other rigid material able to support a minimum of 100 lb (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant bending or distortion.

      (7)  (i) Long-handled dehooker for ingested hooks. This item is intended to be used to remove ingested hooks from sea turtles that cannot be boated, and to engage a loose hook when a turtle is entangled but not hooked and line is being removed. One long-handled dehooker for ingested hooks is required on board. The minimum design and performance standards are as follows:

      (A)  The hook removal device must be constructed of   inch (7.94 mm) 316L stainless steel and have a dehooking end no larger than 1  inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The device must be capable of securely engaging and controlling the leader while shielding the barb of the hook to prevent the hook from re-engaging during removal. It must not have any unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as these could cause injury to the esophagus during hook removal. The device must be of a size capable of securing the range of hook sizes and styles used by the vessel.

      (B)  The hook removal device must be securely fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a length equal to or greater than 150 percent of the vessel's freeboard or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended that the handle be designed so that it breaks down into sections. The handle must be sturdy and strong enough to facilitate the secure attachment of the hook removal device.

      (ii) Long-handled dehooker for external hooks. This item is intended to be used to remove externally-hooked hooks from sea turtles that cannot be boated. The long-handled dehooker for ingested hooks described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section meets this requirement. The minimum design and performance standards are as follows:

      (A)  The device must be constructed of   inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel rod. A 5 inch (12.70 cm) tube T-handle of 1 inch (2.54 cm) outside diameter is recommended, but not required. The dehooking end must be blunt with all edges rounded. The device must be of a size capable of securing the range of hook sizes and styles used by the vessel.

      (B)  The handle must have a length equal to or greater than the vessel's freeboard or 3 ft (0.91 m), whichever is greater.

      (iii) Long-handled device to pull an “inverted V.” This item is intended to be used to pull an “inverted V” in the fishing line when disentangling and dehooking entangled sea turtles. One long-handled device to pull an “inverted V” is required on the vessel. The minimum design and performance standards are as follows:

      (11) Monofilament line cutters. This item is intended to be used to cut and remove fishing line as close to the eye of the hook as possible if the hook is swallowed or cannot be removed. One pair of monofilament line cutters is required on board. The minimum design standards are as follows: Monofilament line cutters must be 6 to 9 inches (15.24 to 22.86 cm) in length. The blades must be 1  (4.45 cm) in length and   inches (1.59 cm) wide when closed.

      (12) Mouth openers and gags. These items are intended to be used to open the mouths of boated sea turtles, and to keep them open when removing ingested hooks in a way that allows the hook or line to be removed without causing further injury to the turtle. At least two of the seven different types of mouth openers and gags described below are required on board. The seven types and their minimum design standards are as follows.

      (i) A block of hard wood. A block of hard wood is intended to be used to gag open a turtle's mouth by placing it in the corner of the jaw. It must be made of hard wood of a type that does not splinter (for example, maple), and it must have rounded and smoothed edges. The dimensions must be 10 to 12 inches (24.50 to 30.48 cm) by   to 1  inches (1.90 to 3.18 cm) by   to 1  inches (1.90 to 3.18 cm).

      (ii) A set of three canine mouth gags. A canine mouth gag is intended to be used to gag open a turtle's mouth while allowing hands-free operation after it is in place. A set of canine mouth gags must include one of each of the following sizes: small (5 inches, 12.7 cm), medium (6 inches, 15.2 cm), and large (7 inches, 17.8 cm). They must be constructed of stainless steel. A 1  inch (4.45 cm) long piece of vinyl tubing (  inch, 1.91 cm) outside diameter and   inch (1.59 cm) inside diameter) must be placed over the ends of the gags to protect the turtle's beak.

      (iii) A set of two sturdy canine chew bones. A canine chew bone is intended to be used to gag open a turtle's mouth by placing it in the corner of the jaw. They must be constructed of durable nylon, zylene resin, or thermoplastic polymer, and strong enough to withstand biting without splintering. To accommodate a variety of turtle beak sizes, a set must include one large (5  to 8 inches (13.97 to 20.32 cm) in length) and one small (3  to 4  inches (8.89 to 11.43 cm) in length) canine chew bones.

      (iv) A set of two rope loops covered with hose. A set of two rope loops covered with a piece of hose is intended to be used as a mouth opener and to keep a turtle's mouth open during hook and/or line removal. A set consists of two 3-foot (0.91 m) lengths of poly braid rope, each covered with an 8 inch (20.32 cm) section of   inch (1.27 cm) or   inch (1.91 cm) light-duty garden hose, and each tied into a loop.

      (v) A hank of rope. A hank of rope is intended to be used to gag open a sea turtle's mouth by placing it in the corner of the jaw. A hank of rope is made from a 6 foot (1.83 m) lanyard of braided nylon rope that is folded to create a hank, or looped bundle, of rope. The hank must be 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 cm) in thickness.

      (vi) A set of four PVC splice couplings. PVC splice couplings are intended to be used to allow access to the back of the mouth of a turtle for hook and line removal by positioning them inside a turtle's mouth and holding them in place with long-nose or needle-nose pliers. The set must consist of the following Schedule 40 PVC splice coupling sizes: 1 inch (2.54 cm), 1  inches (3.18 cm), 1  inches (3.81 cm), and 2 inches (5.08 cm).

      (vii) A large avian oral speculum. A large avian oral speculum is intended to be used to hold a turtle's mouth open and control the head with one hand while removing a hook with the other hand. It must be 9 inches (22.86 cm) in length and constructed of   inch (4.76 mm) wire diameter surgical stainless steel (Type 304). It must be covered with 8 inches (20.32 cm) of clear vinyl tubing   inch (7.94 mm) outside diameter,   inch (4.76 mm) inside diameter.

      (b) Handling requirements. If a sea turtle is observed to be hooked or entangled in fishing gear from any vessel fishing under the Pelagics FEP, vessel owners and operators must use the required mitigation gear set forth in paragraph (a) of this section to comply with these handling requirements. Any hooked or entangled sea turtle must be handled in a manner to minimize injury and promote survival.

      (1) Sea turtles that cannot be brought aboard. In instances where a sea turtle is too large to be brought aboard or the sea turtle cannot be brought aboard without causing further injury to the sea turtle, the vessel owner or operator must disentangle and remove the gear, or cut the line as close as possible to the hook or entanglement, to remove the maximum amount of the gear from the sea turtle.

      (2) Sea turtles that can be brought aboard. In instances where a sea turtle is not too large to be brought aboard, or the sea turtle can be brought aboard without causing further injury to the turtle, the vessel owner or operator must take the following actions:

      (i) Immediately bring the sea turtle aboard;

      (ii) Handle the sea turtle in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section; and

      (iii) Disentangle and remove the gear, or cut the line as close as possible to the hook or entanglement, to remove the maximum amount of the gear from the sea turtle.

      (3)  If a sea turtle appears dead or comatose, the following actions must be taken:

      (i) Place the sea turtle on its belly (on the bottom shell or plastron) so that the sea turtle is right side up and its hindquarters elevated at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) for a period of no less than 4 hours and no more than 24 hours. The amount of the elevation varies with the size of the sea turtle; greater elevations are needed for larger sea turtles;

      (ii) Administer a reflex test at least once every 3 hours. The test is to be performed by gently touching the eye and pinching the tail of a sea turtle to determine if the sea turtle is responsive;

      (iii) Keep the sea turtle shaded and damp or moist (but under no circumstances place the sea turtle into a container holding water). A water-soaked towel placed over the eyes, carapace and flippers is the most effective method of keeping a sea turtle moist; and

      (iv) Return to the sea any sea turtle that revives and becomes active in the manner described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Sea turtles that fail to revive within the 24-hour period must also be returned to the sea in the manner described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (4)  After handling a sea turtle in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the sea turtle must be returned to the ocean after identification unless NMFS requests the retention of a dead sea turtle for research. In releasing a sea turtle the vessel owner or operator must:

      (i) Place the vessel engine in neutral gear so that the propeller is disengaged and the vessel is stopped, and release the sea turtle away from deployed gear; and

      (ii) Observe that the turtle is safely away from the vessel before engaging the propeller and continuing operations.

      (5) Other sea turtle requirements. No sea turtle, including a dead turtle, may be consumed or sold. A sea turtle may be landed, offloaded, transshipped or kept below deck only if NMFS requests the retention of a dead sea turtle for research.

#### § § 665.813

      (a) [Reserved]

      (b) —(1)  There are limits on the maximum number of allowable physical interactions that occur each year between leatherback sea turtles and vessels registered for use under Hawaii longline limited access permits while engaged in shallow-set fishing.

      (i) The annual fleet limit for leatherback sea turtles () is 16.

      (ii) Upon determination by the Regional Administrator that the shallow-set fleet has reached the limit during a given calendar year, the Regional Administrator will, as soon as practicable, file for publication at the Office of the Federal Register a notification that the fleet reached the limit, and that shallow-set fishing north of the Equator will be prohibited beginning at a specified date until the end of the calendar year in which the limit was reached.

      (2)  There are limits on the maximum number of allowable physical interactions that occur during a single fishing trip between leatherback and North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles and individual vessels registered for use under Hawaii longline limited access permits while engaged in shallow-set fishing. For purposes of this section, a shallow-set fishing trip commences when a vessel departs port, and ends when the vessel returns to port, regardless of whether fish are landed. For purposes of this section, a calendar year is the year in which a vessel reaches a trip limit.

      (i) The trip limit for leatherback sea turtles is 2, and the trip limit for North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles () is 5.

      (ii) Upon determination by the Regional Administrator that a vessel has reached either sea turtle limit during a single fishing trip, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit holder and the vessel operator that the vessel has reached a trip limit, and that the vessel is required to immediately retrieve all fishing gear and stop fishing.

      (iii) Upon notification, the vessel operator shall immediately retrieve all fishing gear, stop fishing, and return to port.

      (iv) A vessel that reaches a trip limit for either turtle species during a calendar year shall be prohibited from engaging in shallow-set fishing during the 5 days immediately following the vessel's return to port.

      (v) A vessel that reaches a trip limit a second time during a calendar year, for the same turtle species as the first instance, shall be prohibited from engaging in shallow-set fishing for the remainder of that calendar year. Additionally, in the subsequent calendar year, that vessel shall be limited to an annual interaction limit for that species, either 2 leatherback or 5 North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles. If that subsequent annual interaction limit is reached, that vessel shall be prohibited from engaging in shallow-set fishing for the remainder of that calendar year.

      (vi) Upon determination by the Regional Administrator that a vessel has reached an annual interaction limit, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit holder and the vessel operator that the vessel has reached the limit, and that the vessel is required to immediately stop fishing and return to port.

      (vii) Upon notification, the vessel operator shall immediately retrieve all fishing gear, stop fishing, and return to port.

As used in this paragraph “float line” means a line used to suspend the main longline beneath a float, and “light stick” means any type of light emitting device, including any fluorescent “glow bead,” chemical, or electrically powered light that is affixed underwater to the longline gear.

      (e) [Reserved]

      (f) Any owner or operator of a vessel registered for use under any longline permit issued under § 665.801 must use only circle hooks sized 18/0 or larger, with an offset not to exceed 10 degrees, when shallow-setting north of the Equator (0° lat.). As used in this paragraph, an offset circle hook sized 18/0 or larger is one with an outer diameter at its widest point no smaller than 1.97 inches (50 mm) when measured with the eye of the hook on the vertical axis (y-axis) and perpendicular to the horizontal axis (x-axis). As used in this paragraph, the allowable offset is measured from the barbed end of the hook, and is relative to the parallel plane of the eyed-end, or shank, of the hook when laid on its side.

      (g) Any owner or operator of a vessel registered for use under any longline permit issued under § 665.801 must use only mackerel-type bait when shallow-setting north of the Equator (0° lat.). As used in this paragraph, mackerel-type bait means a whole fusiform fish with a predominantly blue, green or gray back and predominantly gray, silver or white lower sides and belly.

      (h) Owners and operators of vessels registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit may make sets only of the type (shallow-setting or deep-setting) indicated in the notification to NMFS pursuant to § 665.803(a).

      (i) A vessel registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit may not be used to engage in shallow-setting north of the Equator any time during which shallow-set fishing is prohibited pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

      (j)  When fishing north of the Equator (0° lat.), owners and operators of vessels registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit, on a trip for which the permit holder notified NMFS under § 665.803(a) that the vessel would deep-set, may possess or land no more than the following number of swordfish for such trip:

      (1) If an observer is on board, there is no limit.

      (2) If there is no observer on board, and if only circle hooks are used, the limit is 25.

      (3) If there is no observer on board, and if any type of hook other than a circle hook is used, the limit is 10.

      (k)  When fishing south of the Equator (0° lat.) for western Pacific pelagic MUS, owners and operators of vessels longer than 40 ft (12.2 m) registered for use with any valid longline permit issued pursuant to § 665.801 must use longline gear that is configured according to the requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section.

      (1) Each float line must be at least 30 m long.

      (2) At least 15 branch lines must be attached to the mainline between any two float lines attached to the mainline.

      (d) An owner and an operator of a vessel registered for use under any longline permit issued under § 665.801 must have on board the vessel a valid protected species workshop certificate issued by NMFS to the operator of the vessel, or a legible copy thereof.

      § 665.815   Pelagic longline seabird mitigation measures.

#### § § 665.815

      (a)  When deep-setting or shallow-setting north of lat. 23° N or shallow-setting south of lat. 23° N, owners and operators of vessels registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit, must either side-set according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or fish in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section, as applicable.

      (1) Side-setting. Owners and operators of vessels opting to side-set under this section must fish according to the following specifications:

      (i) The mainline must be deployed as far forward on the vessel as practicable, and at least 1 m (3.3 ft) forward from the stern of the vessel;

      (ii) The mainline and branch lines must be set from the port or the starboard side of the vessel;

      (iii) If a mainline shooter is used, the mainline shooter must be mounted as far forward on the vessel as practicable, and at least 1 m (3.3 ft) forward from the stern of the vessel;

      (iv) Branch lines must have weights with a minimum weight of 45 g (1.6 oz);

      (v) One weight must be connected to each branch line within 1 m (3.3 ft) of each hook;

      (vi) When seabirds are present, the longline gear must be deployed so that baited hooks remain submerged and do not rise to the sea surface; and

      (vii) A bird curtain must be deployed. Each bird curtain must consist of the following three components: a pole that is fixed to the side of the vessel aft of the line shooter and which is at least 3 m (9.8 ft) long; at least three main streamers that are attached at regular intervals to the upper 2 m (6.6 ft) of the pole and each of which has a minimum diameter of 20 mm (0.8 in); and branch streamers attached to each main streamer at the end opposite from the pole, each of which is long enough to drag on the sea surface in the absence of wind, and each of which has a minimum diameter 10 mm (0.4 in).

      (2)  Owners and operators of vessels engaged in shallow-setting that do not side-set must do the following:

      (i) Discharge fish, fish parts (offal), or spent bait while setting or hauling longline gear, on the opposite side of the vessel from where the longline gear is being set or hauled, when seabirds are present;

      (ii) Retain sufficient quantities of fish, fish parts, or spent bait between the setting of longline gear for the purpose of strategically discharging it in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;

      (iii) Remove all hooks from fish, fish parts, or spent bait prior to its discharge in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;

      (iv) Remove the bill and liver of any swordfish that is caught, sever its head from the trunk and cut it in half vertically and periodically discharge the butchered heads and livers in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;

      (v) Begin the deployment of longline gear at least 1 hour after local sunset and complete the deployment no later than local sunrise, using only the minimum vessel lights to conform with navigation rules and best safety practices;

      (vi) Use completely thawed bait that has been dyed blue to an intensity level specified by a color quality control card issued by NMFS;

      (vii) Maintain a minimum of two cans (each sold as 0.45 kg or 1 lb size) containing blue dye on board the vessel; and

      (viii) Follow the requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable.

      (3)  Owners and operators of vessels engaged in deep-setting using a monofilament main longline north of lat. 23° N that do not side-set must do the following:

      (i) Employ a tori line system, prior to the first hook being set, that meets the following specifications:

      (A)  The tori line must have an aerial section with a minimum length of 50 m (164 ft) and be made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, or other NMFS-approved material that is light-weight, water resistant, low stretch, and floats in water. The tori line must have a drag section made of a 6 millimeters or larger braided material that is water resistant and floats in water. Monofilament nylon is prohibited for use in the aerial or drag sections of the tori line. The tori line must have a minimum total length of 100 m (328 ft).

      (B)  The aerial section of the tori line must have light-weight material (hereafter referred to as streamers) that are attached to the aerial section at intervals less than 1 m (3.3 ft) apart. Each streamer must have a length of at least 30 cm (11.8 in) from its attachment point to the tori line so that it hangs and moves freely/flutters in the wind. Where a single streamer is either threaded through or tied to the tori line, each length must measure at least 30 cm (11.8 in). Streamers are not required for the last 20 m (65.6 ft) of the aerial section to minimize entanglements with buoys and fishing gear.

      (C)  Two tori lines meeting the specifications in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section must be present on the vessel at the start of every trip.

      (D)  The aerial section of the tori line must be attached to the vessel or a fixed structure on the vessel made of rigid material. A weak link must be placed between the tori line and the point of attachment so that the tori line will break away from the point of attachment if gear entanglement creates tension on the tori line. The attachment point must have a minimum height of 5 m (16.4 ft) above the water when the attachment point is located within 2 m (6.6 ft) of the vessel stern. When the attachment point is more than 2 m (6.6 ft) from the stern, the attachment point height must be increased by 0.5 m (1.6 ft) for every 5 m (16.4 ft) distance from the stern.

      (E)  If the structure used to attach the tori line breaks during a trip, the operator may use an alternative attachment point at the highest possible point on the vessel that is lower than the height specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(D) of this section to continue fishing north of lat. 23° N. The exemption is only valid during the trip in which the structure broke.

      (ii) Employ a line shooter.

      (iii) Attach a weight of at least 45 g (1.6 oz) to each branch line within 1 m (3.3 ft) of the hook.

      (4)  When using basket-style longline gear north of lat. 23° N, owners and operators of vessels that do not side-set must ensure that the main longline is deployed slack to maximize its sink rate.

      (b) Short-tailed albatross handling techniques. If a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit, owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:

      (1) Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the bird on board the vessel using a dip net;

      (2) Cover the bird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils or damage while being handled;

      (3) Remove any entangled lines from the bird; and

      (4) Determine if the bird is alive or dead.

      (i) If dead, freeze the bird immediately with an identification tag attached directly to the specimen listing the species, location and date of mortality, and band number if the bird has a leg band. Attach a duplicate identification tag to the bag or container holding the bird. Any leg bands present must remain on the bird. Contact NMFS, the USCG, or the USFWS at the numbers listed on the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS protected species workshop, inform them that you have a dead short-tailed albatross on board, and submit the bird to NMFS within 72 hours following completion of the fishing trip.

      (ii) If alive, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (b)(5) through (11) of this section.

      (5) Place the bird in a safe enclosed place;

      (6) Immediately contact NMFS, the USCG, or the USFWS at the numbers listed on the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS protected species workshop and request veterinary guidance;

      (7) Follow the veterinary guidance regarding the handling and release of the bird;

      (8) If the bird is externally hooked and no veterinary guidance is received within 24-48 hours, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, and release the bird only if it meets the following criteria:

      (i) Able to hold its head erect and respond to noise and motion stimuli;

      (ii) Able to breathe without noise;

      (iii) Capable of flapping and retracting both wings to normal folded position on its back;

      (iv) Able to stand on both feet with toes pointed forward; and

      (v) Feathers are dry.

      (9) Any seabird that is released in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section or under the guidance of a veterinarian must be placed on the sea surface;

      (10) If the hook has been ingested or is inaccessible, keep the bird in a safe, enclosed place and submit it to NMFS immediately upon the vessel's return to port. Do not give the bird food or water; and

      (11) Complete the short-tailed albatross recovery data form issued by NMFS.

      (c) Non-short-tailed albatross seabird handling techniques. If a seabird other than a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:

      § 665.816   American Samoa longline limited entry program.

#### § § 665.816

      (a)  Under § 665.801(c), certain U.S. vessels are required to be registered for use under a valid American Samoa longline limited access permit. Under the American Samoa Longline Limited Entry Program, the maximum number of longline fishing permits available is limited to 60 permits annually.

      (b)  For purposes of this section, the following terms have these meanings:

      (1)  means participation proved by, but not necessarily limited to, a properly submitted NMFS or American Samoa logbook, an American Samoa creel survey record, a delivery or payment record from an American Samoa-based cannery, retailer or wholesaler, an American Samoa tax record, an individual wage record, ownership title, vessel registration, or other official documents showing:

      (i) Ownership of a vessel that was used to fish in the EEZ around American Samoa; or

      (ii) Evidence of work on a fishing trip during which longline gear was used to harvest western Pacific pelagic MUS in the EEZ around American Samoa. If the applicant does not possess the necessary documentation of evidence of work on a fishing trip based on records available only from NMFS or the Government of American Samoa ( creel survey record or logbook), the applicant may issue a request to PIRO to obtain such records from the appropriate agencies, if available. The applicant should provide sufficient information on the fishing trip to allow PIRO to retrieve the records.

      (2)  means those people related by blood, marriage, and formal or informal adoption.

      (c)  The Regional Administrator shall issue American Samoa longline limited access permits in the following size classes:

      (1) Small vessel, which is less than 50 ft (15.2 m) LOA.

      (2) Large vessel, which is equal to or over 50 ft (15.2 m) LOA.

      (d)  Any U.S. national or U.S. citizen or company, partnership, or corporation is eligible for an American Samoa longline limited access permit.

      (e)  (1) If the number of permits issued falls below the maximum number of permits allowed, the Regional Administrator shall publish a notice in the  and use other means to notify prospective applicants of any available permit(s) in each class. Any application for issuance of a permit must be submitted to PIRO no later than 120 days after the date of publication of the notice on the availability of additional permits in the  The Regional Administrator shall issue permits to persons according to the following priority standard:

      (i) Priority accrues to the person with the earliest documented participation in the pelagic longline fishery in the EEZ around American Samoa from smallest to largest vessel.

      (ii) In the event of a tie in the priority ranking between two or more applicants, the applicant whose second documented participation in the pelagic longline fishery in the EEZ around American Samoa is first in time will be ranked first in priority. If there is still a tie between two or more applicants, the Regional Administrator will select the successful applicant by an impartial lottery.

      (2) An application must be made, and application fees paid, in accordance with § 665.13(c)(1), (d), and (f)(2). If the applicant is any entity other than a sole owner, the application must be accompanied by a supplementary information sheet, obtained from the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries, containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners, partners, and corporate officers that comprise ownership of the vessel for which the permit application is prepared.

      (3) Within 30 days of receipt of a completed application, the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries shall make a decision on whether the applicant qualifies for a permit and will notify the successful applicant by a dated letter. The successful applicant must register a vessel of appropriate size to the permit within 120 days of the date of the letter of notification. The successful applicant must also submit a supplementary information sheet, obtained from the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries, containing the name and mailing address of the owner of the vessel to which the permit is registered. If the registered vessel is owned by any entity other than a sole owner, the names and mailing addresses of all owners, partners, and corporate officers must be included. If the successful applicant fails to register a vessel to the permit within 120 days of the date of the letter of notification, the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries shall issue a letter of notification to the next person on the priority list or, in the event that there are no more prospective applicants on the priority list, re-start the issuance process pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Any person who fails to register the permit to a vessel under this paragraph (e)(3) within 120 days shall not be eligible to apply for a permit for 6 months from the date those 120 days expired.

      (4) An appeal of a denial of an application for a permit shall be processed in accordance with § 665.801(o).

      (f)  The duration of a permit is three years from the date of issuance by NMFS.

      (g)  The holder of an American Samoa longline limited access permit may transfer the permit to another individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity as described in this section. The application for permit transfer must be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 30 days of the transfer date. If the applicant is any entity other than a sole owner, the application must be accompanied by a supplementary information sheet, obtained from the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries, containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners, partners, and corporate officers. After such an application has been made, the permit is not valid for use by the new permit holder until the Regional Administrator has issued the permit in the new permit holder's name under § 665.13(c).

      (1) An American Samoa longline limited access permit may be transferred (by sale, gift, bequest, intestate succession, barter, or trade) to only the following persons:

      (i) A western Pacific community located in American Samoa that meets the criteria set forth in section 305(I)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. 1855(I)(2), and its implementing regulations in this part; or

      (ii) Any U.S. citizens or national.

      (2) Additionally, an American Samoa longline limited access small vessel permit may also be transferred (by sale, gift, bequest, intestate succession, barter, or trade) to a family member of the permit holder.

      (h)  (1) An American Samoa longline limited access permit will not be renewed following three years in which the vessel(s) to which it is registered landed less than:

      (i) Small vessel: A total of 500 lb (227 kg) of western Pacific pelagic MUS harvested using longline gear; or

      (ii) Large vessel: A total of 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of western Pacific pelagic MUS harvested using longline gear.

      (2) For all vessels, the minimum harvest amount must be landed in American Samoa.

      (3) In the event of a transfer, the new permit holder would be required to meet the harvest requirement based on the following formula: Remaining harvest amount = product of percentage of time left within the 3-year permit period and the minimum harvest amount for that size vessel. The original permit term and duration does not change in the event of a transfer.

      (i)  No more than 10 percent of the maximum number of permits, of both size classes combined, may be held by the same permit holder. Fractional interest will be counted as a full permit for calculating whether the 10-percent standard has been reached.

      § 665.818   Exemptions for American Samoa large vessel prohibited areas.

#### § § 665.818

      (a)  (1) An exemption will be issued to a person who currently owns a large vessel to use that vessel to fish for western Pacific pelagic MUS in the American Samoa large vessel prohibited areas, if the person seeking the exemption had been the owner of that vessel when it was registered for use with a Western Pacific general longline permit, and has made at least one landing of western Pacific pelagic MUS in American Samoa on or prior to November 13, 1997.

      (2) A landing of western Pacific pelagic MUS for the purpose of this paragraph must have been properly recorded on a NMFS Western Pacific Federal daily longline form that was submitted to NMFS, as required in § 665.14.

      (3) An exemption is valid only for a vessel that was registered for use with a Western Pacific general longline permit and landed western Pacific pelagic MUS in American Samoa on or prior to November 13, 1997, or for a replacement vessel of equal or smaller LOA than the vessel that was initially registered for use with a Western Pacific general longline permit on or prior to November 13, 1997.

      (4) An exemption is valid only for the vessel for which it is registered. An exemption not registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used.

      (5) An exemption may not be transferred to another person.

      (6) If more than one person, e.g., a partnership or corporation, owned a large vessel when it was registered for use with a Western Pacific general longline permit and made at least one landing of western Pacific pelagic MUS in American Samoa on or prior to November 13, 1997, an exemption issued under this section will be issued to only one person.

      (b)  Except as otherwise prohibited in subpart I of this part, a vessel of any size that is registered for use with a valid American Samoa longline limited access permit is authorized to fish for western Pacific pelagic MUS within the American Samoa large vessel prohibited areas as defined in § 665.806(b), except that no large vessel as defined in § 665.12 may be used to fish for western Pacific pelagic MUS in the portions of the American Samoa large vessel prohibited areas, as follows:

      § 665.819   Territorial catch and fishing effort limits.

#### § § 665.819

      (a)  (1) Notwithstanding § 665.4, if the WCPFC agrees to a catch or fishing effort limit for a stock of western Pacific pelagic MUS that is applicable to a U.S. participating territory, the Regional Administrator may specify an annual or multi-year catch or fishing effort limit for a U.S. participating territory, as recommended by the Council, not to exceed the WCPFC adopted limit. The Regional Administrator may authorize such U.S. participating territory to allocate a portion, as recommended by the Council, of the specified catch or fishing effort limit to a fishing vessel or vessels holding a valid permit issued under § 665.801 through a specified fishing agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) If the WCPFC does not agree to a catch or fishing effort limit for a stock of western Pacific pelagic MUS applicable to a U.S. participating territory, the Council may recommend that the Regional Administrator specify such a limit that is consistent with the Pelagics FEP, other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws. The Council may also recommend that the Regional Administrator authorize a U.S. participating territory to allocate a portion of a specified catch or fishing effort limit to a fishing vessel or vessels holding valid permits issued under § 665.801 through a specified fishing agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) The Council shall review any existing or proposed catch or fishing effort limit specification and portion available for allocation at least annually to ensure consistency with the Pelagics FEP, Magnuson-Stevens Act, WCPFC decisions, and other applicable laws. Based on this review, at least annually, the Council shall recommend to the Regional Administrator whether such catch or fishing effort limit specification or portion available for allocation should be approved for the next fishing year.

      (4) The Regional Administrator shall review any Council recommendation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and, if determined to be consistent with the Pelagics FEP, Magnuson-Stevens Act, WCPFC decisions, and other applicable laws, shall approve such recommendation. If the Regional Administrator determines that a recommendation is inconsistent with the Pelagics FEP, Magnuson-Stevens Act, WCPFC decisions and other applicable laws, the Regional Administrator will disapprove the recommendation and provide the Council with a written explanation of the reasons for disapproval. If a catch or fishing effort limit specification or allocation limit is disapproved, or if the Council recommends and NMFS approves no catch or fishing effort limit specification or allocation limit, no specified fishing agreements as described in paragraph (c) of this section will be accepted for the fishing year covered by such action.

      (b)  (1) After receiving a Council recommendation for a catch or fishing effort limit specification, or portion available for allocation, the Regional Administrator will evaluate the recommendation for consistency with the Pelagics FEP, other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws.

      (2) The Regional Administrator will publish in the  a notice and request for public comment of the proposed catch or fishing effort limit specification and any portion of the limit that may be allocated to a fishing vessel or vessels holding a valid permit issued under § 665.801.

      (3) The Regional Administrator will publish in the  a notice of the final catch or fishing effort limit specification and portion of the limit that may be allocated to a fishing vessel or vessels holding valid permits issued under § 665.801. The final specification of a catch or fishing effort limit will also announce the deadline for submitting a specified fishing agreement for review as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The deadline will be no earlier than 30 days after the publication date of the  notice that specifies the final catch or fishing effort limit and the portion of the limit that may be allocated through a specified fishing agreement.

      (c)  A specified fishing agreement means an agreement between a U.S. participating territory and the owner or a designated representative of a fishing vessel or vessels holding a valid permit issued under § 665.801 of this part. An agreement provides access to an identified portion of a catch or fishing effort limit and may not exceed the amount specified for the territory and made available for allocation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The identified portion of a catch or fishing effort limit in an agreement must account for recent and anticipated harvest on the stock or stock complex or fishing effort, and any other valid agreements with the territory during the same year not to exceed the territory's catch or fishing effort limit or allocation limit.

      (1) An authorized official or designated representative of a U.S. participating territory may submit a complete specified fishing agreement to the Council for review. A complete specified fishing agreement must meet the following requirements:

      (i) Identify the vessel(s) to which the fishing agreement applies, along with documentation that such vessel(s) possesses a valid permit issued under § 665.801;

      (ii) Identify the amount (weight) of western Pacific pelagic MUS to which the fishing agreement applies, if applicable;

      (iii) Identify the amount of fishing effort to which the fishing agreement applies, if applicable;

      (iv) Be signed by an authorized official of the applicable U.S. participating territory, or designated representative;

      (v) Be signed by each vessel owner or designated representative; and

      (vi) Satisfy either paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section:

      (A) Require the identified vessels to land or offload catch in the ports of the U.S. participating territory to which the fishing agreement applies; or

      (B) Specify the amount of monetary contributions that each vessel owner in the agreement, or his or her designated representative, will deposit into the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund.

      (vii) Be consistent with the Pelagics FEP and implementing regulations, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws; and

      (viii) Shall not confer any right of compensation to any party enforceable against the United States should action under such agreement be prohibited or limited by NMFS pursuant to its authority under Magnuson-Stevens Act, or other applicable laws.

      (2)  The Council, through its Executive Director, will review a submitted specified fishing agreement to ensure that it is consistent with paragraph (1) of this section. The Council will advise the authorized official or designated representative of the U.S. participating territory to which the agreement applies of any inconsistency and provide an opportunity to modify the agreement, as appropriate. The Council will transmit the complete specified fishing agreement to the Regional Administrator for review.

      (3)  (i) Upon receipt of a specified fishing agreement from the Council, the Regional Administrator will consider such agreement for consistency with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Pelagics FEP and implementing regulations, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws.

      (ii) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the fishing agreement from the Council, the Regional Administrator will provide the authorized official or designated representative of the U.S. participating territory to which the agreement applies and the signatory vessel owners or their designated representatives with written notice of whether the agreement meets the requirements of this section. The Regional Administrator will reject an agreement for any of the following reasons:

      (A) The agreement fails to meet the criteria specified in this subpart;

      (B) The applicant has failed to disclose material information;

      (C) The applicant has made a material false statement related to the specified fishing agreement;

      (D) The agreement is inconsistent with the Pelagics FEP, implementing regulations, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, or other applicable laws; or

      (E) The agreement includes a vessel identified in another valid specified fishing agreement.

      (iii) The Regional Administrator, in consultation with the Council, may recommend that specified fishing agreements include such additional terms and conditions as are necessary to ensure consistency with the Pelagics FEP and implementing regulations, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws.

      (iv) The U.S. participating territory must notify NMFS and the Council in writing of any changes in the identity of fishing vessels to which the specified fishing agreement applies within 72 hours of the change.

      (v) Upon written notice that a specified fishing agreement fails to meet the requirements of this section, the Regional Administrator may provide the U.S. participating territory an opportunity to modify the fishing agreement within the time period prescribed in the notice. Such opportunity to modify the agreement may not exceed 30 days following the date of written notice. The U.S. participating territory may resubmit the agreement according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (vi) The absence of the Regional Administrator's written notice within the time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section or, if applicable, within the extended time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section shall operate as the Regional Administrator's finding that the fishing agreement meets the requirements of this section.

      (4)  Specified fishing agreements authorized under this section are not transferable or assignable, except as allowed pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.

      (5) A vessel shall not be identified in more than one valid specified fishing agreement at a time.

      (6)  The Regional Administrator, in consultation with the Council, may at any time revoke or suspend attribution under a specified fishing agreement upon the determination that either: Operation under the agreement would violate the requirements of the Pelagics FEP or implementing regulations, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, or other applicable laws; or the U.S. participating territory fails to notify NMFS and the Council in writing of any changes in the identity of fishing vessels to which the specified fishing agreement applies within 72 hours of the change.

      (7)  The U.S. participating territory and the vessel owner(s), or designated representative(s), that are party to a specified fishing agreement must notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 72 hours after an agreement is cancelled or no longer valid. A valid notice of cancellation shall require the signatures of both parties to the agreement. All catch or fishing effort attributions under the agreement shall cease upon the written date of a valid notice of cancellation.

      (8)  An authorized official or designated representative of a U.S. participating territory or signatory vessel owners or their designated representatives may appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of a specified fishing agreement affecting their interests to the Regional Administrator in accordance with the permit appeals procedures set forth in § 665.801(o) of this subpart.

      (9)  (i) For vessels identified in a valid specified fishing agreement that are subject to a U.S. limit and fishing restrictions set forth in 50 CFR part 300, subpart O, NMFS will attribute catch made by such vessels to the applicable U.S. participating territory starting seven days before the date NMFS projects the annual U.S. limit to be reached, or upon the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later.

      (ii) For U.S. fishing vessels identified in a valid specified fishing agreement that are subject to catch or fishing effort limits and fishing restrictions set forth in this subpart, NMFS will attribute catch or fishing effort to the applicable U.S. participating territory starting seven days before the date NMFS projects the limit to be reached, or upon the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later.

      (iii) If NMFS determines catch or fishing effort made by fishing vessels identified in a specified fishing agreement exceeds the allocated limit, NMFS will attribute any overage of the limit back to the U.S. or Pacific island fishery to which the vessel(s) is registered and permitted in accordance with the regulations set forth in 50 CFR part 300, subpart O and other applicable laws.

      (d)  (1) NMFS will monitor catch and fishing effort with respect to any territorial catch or fishing effort limit, including the amount of a limit allocated to vessels identified in a valid specified fishing agreement, using data submitted in logbooks and other information. When NMFS projects a territorial catch or fishing effort limit or allocated limit to be reached, the Regional Administrator shall publish notification to that effect in the  at least seven days before the limit will be reached.

      (2) The notice will include an advisement that fishing for the applicable pelagic MUS stock or stock complex, or fishing effort, will be restricted on a specific date. The restriction may include, but is not limited to, a prohibition on retention, closure of a fishery, closure of specific areas, or other catch or fishing effort restrictions. The restriction will remain in effect until the end of the fishing year.

      (e)  (1) NMFS shall make available to the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council monetary contributions, made to the Fund pursuant to a specified fishing agreement, in the following order of priority:

      (i) Project(s) identified in an approved Marine Conservation Plan (16 U.S.C. 1824) of a U.S. participating territory that is a party to a valid specified fishing agreement, pursuant to § 665.819(c); and

      (ii) In the case of two or more valid specified fishing agreements in a fishing year, the projects listed in an approved Marine Conservation Plan applicable to the territory with the earliest valid agreement will be funded first.

      (2) At least seven calendar days prior to the disbursement of any funds, the Council shall provide in writing to NMFS a list identifying the order of priority of the projects in an approved Marine Conservation Plan that are to be funded. The Council may thereafter revise this list.

    Subpart A—General

      § 679.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 679.1

      Regulations in this part were developed by the Council under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801  (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act). Along with part 600 of this chapter, these regulations implement the following:

      (ii) The CDQ group, vessel owner or operator, and Registered Buyer are subject to all of the IFQ prohibitions at § 679.7(f).

      (2)  The CDQ group must obtain a halibut CDQ permit issued by the Regional Administrator. The vessel operator must have a legible copy of a halibut CDQ permit on any fishing vessel operated by, or for, a CDQ group that will have halibut CDQ on board and must make the permit available for inspection by an authorized officer. A halibut CDQ permit is non-transferable and is issued annually until revoked, suspended, surrendered, or modified. A halibut CDQ permit may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. A halibut CDQ permit will not be reissued in the same fishing year in which it was surrendered, but a new annual halibut CDQ permit may be issued in a subsequent fishing year to the CDQ group entitled to a CDQ halibut allocation.

      (3) An individual must have on board the vessel a legible copy of his or her halibut CDQ hired master permit issued by the Regional Administrator while harvesting and landing any CDQ halibut. Each halibut CDQ hired master permit will identify a CDQ permit number and the individual authorized by the CDQ group to land halibut for debit against the CDQ group's halibut CDQ. A halibut CDQ hired master permit may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. A halibut CDQ hired master permit may be reissued to the permit holder of record in the same fishing year in which it was surrendered.

      (4)  No person may alter, erase, mutilate, or forge a halibut CDQ permit, hired master permit, Registered Buyer permit, or any valid or current permit or document issued under this part. Any such permit or document that has been intentionally altered, erased, mutilated, or forged is invalid.

      (5)  A person may land CDQ halibut only if he or she has a valid halibut CDQ hired master permit. The person(s) holding the halibut CDQ hired master permit and the Registered buyer must comply with the requirements of § 679.5(g) and (l)(1) through (6).

      (f) —(1)  No shoreside processor of the United States, SFP, or CQE floating processor defined at § 679.2 may receive, process, purchase, or arrange to purchase unprocessed groundfish harvested in the GOA or BSAI, unless the owner or authorized representative first obtains an FPP issued under this part. A processor may not be operated in a category other than as specified on the FPP. An FPP is issued without charge.

      (2)  To obtain, amend, renew, or surrender an FPP, the owner or authorized representative must complete an FPP application form per the instructions at

      (i)  For the FPP application to be considered complete, all fees due to NMFS from the owner or authorized representative of a shoreside processor or SFP or person named on a Registered Buyer permit subject to the observer fee as specified at § 679.55(c) at the time of application must be paid.

      (ii)  The owner or authorized representative of the shoreside processor, SFP, or CQE floating processor must sign and date the application form, certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief. If the application form is completed by an authorized representative, proof of authorization must accompany the application form.

      (3) —(i)  An FPP is in effect from the effective date through the date of permit expiration, unless it is revoked, suspended, surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section, or modified under § 600.735 or § 600.740 of this chapter.

      (ii)  (A) An FPP may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. An FPP may be reissued to the permit holder of record in the same fishing year in which it was surrendered.

      (B) An owner or authorized representative, who applied for and received an FPP, must notify NMFS of the intention to surrender the FPP by submitting an FPP application form found at the NMFS Web site at  and indicating on the application form that surrender of the FPP is requested. Upon receipt and processing of an FPP surrender application form, NMFS will withdraw the FPP from active status in permit data bases.

      (iii) —(A)  An owner or authorized representative, who applied for and received an FPP, must notify NMFS of any change in the permit information by submitting an FPP application form found at the NMFS Web site at  The owner or authorized representative must submit the application form as instructed on the form. Upon receipt and approval of an FPP amendment application form, NMFS will issue an amended FPP.

      (B)  A GOA inshore processing endorsement is required in order to process GOA inshore pollock and Eastern GOA inshore Pacific cod. If an SFP owner or authorized representative holds an FPP with a GOA Inshore Processing endorsement, the SFP is prohibited from processing GOA pollock and GOA Pacific cod in more than one single geographic location during a fishing year and is also prohibited from operating as a catcher/processor in the BSAI. Once issued, a GOA Inshore Processing endorsement cannot be surrendered for the duration of a fishing year.

      (C)  If a vessel owner or authorized representative holds an FPP with a GOA Inshore Processing endorsement in order to process Pacific cod within the marine municipal boundaries of CQE communities in the Western or Central GOA, the vessel must not meet the definition of an SFP and must not have harvested groundfish off Alaska in the same calendar year.

      (D) Vessels are prohibited from holding both a GOA CQE Floating Processor endorsement and a GOA SFP endorsement during the same calendar year.

      (4)  An FPP issued under this paragraph (f) is not transferable or assignable and is valid only for the processor for which it is issued.

      (5)  A legible copy of a valid FPP issued under this paragraph (f) must be on site at the shoreside processor, SFP, or CQE floating processor at all times and must be presented for inspection upon the request of any authorized officer.

      (g) —(1)  (i) In addition to the permit and licensing requirements prescribed in this part, each vessel within the EEZ off Alaska that is catching and retaining scallops, must have an original scallop LLP license onboard at all times it is catching and retaining scallops. This scallop LLP license, issued by NMFS, authorizes the person named on the license to catch and retain scallops in compliance with State of Alaska regulations and only with a vessel that does not exceed the maximum LOA specified on the license and the gear designation specified on the license.

      (ii) A scallop LLP license may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. A surrendered scallop LLP license will cease to exist and will not be subsequently reissued.

      (2)  A scallop LLP license will be issued to an eligible applicant who:

      (i) Is a qualified person;

      (ii) Was named on a State of Alaska scallop moratorium permit or Federal scallop moratorium permit on February 8, 1999;

      (iii) Used the moratorium permit held on February 8, 1999, to make legal landings of scallops in each of any 2 calendar years during the qualification period beginning January 1, 1996, through October 9, 1998; and

      (iv) Submitted a complete application for a scallop license during the application period specified pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section.

      (3)  A scallop license authorizes the license holder to catch and retain scallops only if the vessel length and gear used do not exceed the vessel length and gear endorsements specified on the license. These endorsements will be determined as follows.

      (i) The MLOA specified on the scallop license is equal to the length overall on February 8, 1999, of the longest vessel that was authorized by a Federal or State of Alaska Scallop Moratorium Permit to harvest scallops and used by the eligible applicant to make legal landings of scallops during the scallop LLP qualification period, as specified at § 679.4(g)(2)(iii) of this part.

      (ii) The gear specified on a scallop license will be restricted to two dredges with a combined width of no more than 20 feet (6.1 m) in all areas if the eligible applicant was a moratorium permit holder with a Scallop Registration Area H (Cook Inlet) endorsement and did not make a legal landing of scallops caught outside Area H during the qualification period specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (4) —(i)  The Regional Administrator will issue a scallop license to an applicant if a complete application is submitted by or on behalf of the applicant during the specified application period, and if that applicant meets all the criteria for eligibility in this part. An application that is postmarked or hand delivered after the ending date for the application period for the scallop LLP specified in paragraph § 679.4(g)(4)(ii) will be denied. An application form will be sent to the last known address of the person identified as an eligible applicant by the official LLP record. An application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.

      (ii)  January 16, 2001, through February 12, 2001.

      (iii)  To be complete, an application for a scallop license must be signed and dated by the applicant, or the individual representing the applicant, and contain the following information, as applicable:

      (A) Scallop Moratorium Permit number under which legal landings of scallops were made during the qualification period specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section;

      (B) Name, business address, telephone number, FAX number, and social security number or tax ID number of the applicant, and whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen or a U.S. business;

      (C) Name of the managing company, if any;

      (D) Evidence of legal landings in the qualifying years and registration areas;

      (E) For the vessel(s) being used as the basis for eligibility for a license, the name, state registration number (e.g., ADF&G number), the USCG documentation number, and valid evidence of the LOA on February 8, 1999, of the longest vessel used by the applicant during the qualification period specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (iv)  If an applicant is applying as the successor-in-interest to an eligible applicant, an application, to be complete, also must contain valid evidence proving the applicant's status as a successor-in-interest to that eligible applicant and:

      (A) Valid evidence of the death of that eligible applicant at the time of application, if the eligible applicant was an individual; or

      (B) Valid evidence that the eligible applicant is no longer in existence at the time of application, if the eligible applicant is not an individual.

      (v)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate an application submitted during the specified application period and compare all claims in the application with the information in the official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified by evidence, will not be accepted. An applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section, will be provided a 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct.

      (vi)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the official LLP record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP record.

      (vii)  The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 60-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record, if the Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the burden of proving that the information on the application is correct through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that information. An applicant will be limited to one _60-day evidentiary period._ Additional information or evidence, or a revised application, received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.

      (viii)  The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that appeal in the applicant's favor.

      (ix)  The Regional Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant at the same time notification is provided to the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period if issuance is required by the license renewal provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a person to catch and retain scallops as specified on the non-transferable license, and will have the specific endorsements and designations based on the claims in his or her application. A non-transferable license will expire upon final agency action.

      (5) —(i)  The Regional Administrator will approve the transfer of a scallop license if a complete transfer application is submitted to Restricted Access Management, Alaska Region, NMFS, and if the transfer meets all the eligibility criteria as specified in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section. An application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.

      (ii)  A scallop license can be transferred if:

      (A) The designated transferee is eligible to document a fishing vessel under Chapter 121, Title 46, U.S.C.;

      (B) The parties to the transfer do not have any fines, civil penalties, other payments due and outstanding, or outstanding permit sanctions resulting from Federal fishing violations;

      (C) The transfer will not cause the designated transferee to exceed the license limit in § 679.7(i); and

      (D) The transfer does not violate any other provision specified in this part.

      (iii)  To be complete, an application for a scallop license transfer must be signed by the license holder and the designated transferee, or the individuals representing them, and contain the following information, as applicable:

      (A) Name, business address, telephone number, and FAX number of the license holder and of the designated transferee;

      (B) License number and total price being paid for the license;

      (C) Certification that the designated transferee is a U.S. citizen, or a U.S. corporation, partnership, or other association;

      (D) A legible copy of a contract or sales agreement that specifies the license to be transferred, the license holder, the designated transferee, the monetary value or the terms of the license transfer; and

      (E) Other information the Regional Administrator deems necessary for measuring program performance.

      (iv)  The Regional Administrator will return an incomplete transfer application to the applicant and identify any deficiencies if the Regional Administrator determines that the application does not meet all the criteria identified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.

      (v)  The Regional Administrator will transfer a scallop license based on a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement if the Regional Administrator determines that the transfer application is complete and the transfer will not violate any of the provisions of this section.

      () Each groundfish LLP license endorsed to catch and process Pacific cod with hook-and-line gear in the BS or AI, or both, and designated in column C of Table 9 to this part is eligible to be assigned a _2_20-foot (67 m) MLOA if the LLP holder submits a timely written request to remove all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements on that LLP following the process established under paragraph (k)(6)(xi) of this section.

      (E)  An AFA rebuilt vessel or an AFA replacement vessel may exceed the MLOA on an LLP groundfish license with a Bering Sea area endorsement or an Aleutian Islands area endorsement when the vessel is conducting directed fishing for groundfish in the BSAI pursuant to that LLP groundfish license and when the exemption is specified on the LLP license.

      (ii) —(A)  A license will be assigned a catcher/processor vessel designation if:

      () For license limitation groundfish, license limitation groundfish were processed on the vessel that qualified for the groundfish license under paragraph (k)(4) of this section during the period January _1_, 1994, through June 17, 1995, or in the most recent calendar year of participation during the area endorsement qualifying period specified in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section; or

      () For crab species, crab species were processed on the vessel that qualified for the crab species license under paragraph (k)(5) of this section during the period January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994, or in the most recent calendar year of participation during the area endorsement qualifying period specified in paragraph (k)(5)(ii) of this section.

      () For purposes of paragraphs (k)(_3_)(ii)(A)() and (k)(3)(ii)(A)() of this section, evidence of processing must be demonstrated by production reports or other valid documentation demonstrating that processing occurred on the vessel during the relevant period.

      (B)  A license will be assigned a catcher vessel designation if it does not meet the criteria in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A)() or (k)(3)(ii)(A)() of this section to be assigned a catcher/processor vessel designation.

      (C)  A person who holds a groundfish license or a crab species license with a catcher/processor vessel designation may, upon request to the Regional Administrator, have the license reissued with a catcher vessel designation. The vessel designation change to a catcher vessel will be permanent, and that license will be valid for only those activities specified in the definition of catcher vessel designation at § 679.2.

      (D)  Up to 1 mt of round weight equivalent of license limitation groundfish or crab species may be processed per day on a vessel less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA that is authorized to fish with an LLP license with a catcher vessel designation.

      (iii)  A vessel's eligibility will be determined using the following three vessel length categories, which are based on the vessel's LOA on June 17, 1995, or, if the vessel was under reconstruction on June 17, 1995, the vessel's length on the date that reconstruction was completed.

      (A) Vessel length category “A” if the LOA of the qualifying vessel on the relevant date was equal to or greater than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA.

      (B) Vessel length category “B” if the LOA of the qualifying vessel on the relevant date was equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA.

      (C) Vessel length category “C” if the LOA of the qualifying vessel on the relevant date was less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA.

      (iv) —(A)  A vessel may only use gear consistent with the gear designation on the LLP license authorizing the use of that vessel to fish for license limitation groundfish or crab species, except that a vessel fishing under authority of an LLP license endorsed only for trawl gear may fish for slope rockfish with non-trawl gear within the Gulf of Alaska Slope Habitat Conservation Areas, as described in Table 27 to this part.

      (B)  A license will be assigned a trawl/non-trawl gear designation if trawl and non-trawl gear were used to harvest LLP species from the qualifying vessel during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 17, 1995.

      (C)  A license will be assigned a trawl gear designation if only trawl gear was used to harvest LLP species from the qualifying vessel during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 17, 1995.

      (D)  A license will be assigned a non-trawl gear designation if only non-trawl gear was used to harvest LLP species from the qualifying vessel during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 17, 1995.

      (E)  () An applicant may request a change of gear designation based on gear used from the vessel during the period beginning June _1_8, 1995, through February 7, 1998. Such a change would be permanent and may only be used for a change from trawl to non-trawl or from non-trawl to trawl.

      () An applicant may request a change of gear designation based on a significant financial investment in converting a vessel or purchasing fishing gear on or before February 7, 1998, and making a documented harvest with that gear on or before December 31, 1998. Such a change would be permanent and may only be used for a change from trawl to non-trawl or from non-trawl to trawl.

      (F)  () For purposes of paragraph (k)(3)(iv) of this section, non-trawl gear means any legal gear, other than trawl, used to harvest license limitation groundfish.

      () For purposes of paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(E)(_2_) of this section, “significant financial investment” means having spent at least $100,000 toward vessel conversion and/or gear to change to trawl gear from non-trawl gear, or having acquired groundline, hooks, pots, jig machines, or hauling equipment to change to non-trawl gear from trawl gear.

      (4)  A groundfish license will be issued to an eligible applicant that meets the criteria in paragraphs (k)(4)(i) and (k)(4)(ii) of this section. For purposes of the license limitation program, evidence of a documented harvest must be demonstrated by a state catch report, a Federal catch report, or other valid documentation that indicates the amount of license limitation groundfish harvested, the groundfish reporting area in which the license limitation groundfish was harvested, the vessel and gear type used to harvest the license limitation groundfish, and the date of harvesting, landing, or reporting. State catch reports are Alaska, California, Oregon, or Washington fish tickets. Federal catch reports are production reports required under § 679.5.

      (i)  This table provides the GQP documented harvest requirements for LLP groundfish licenses:

      (ii)  This table provides the documented harvest requirements for LLP groundfish license area endorsements:

      (iii) An eligible applicant that is issued a groundfish license based on a vessel's qualifications in the table at paragraphs (k)(4)(i)(A)(2) or (k)(4)(i)(B)(2) of this section must choose only one area endorsement for that groundfish license even if documented harvests qualifies the eligible applicant for more than one area endorsement.

      (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section, NMFS will issue a groundfish license with the appropriate area endorsements to an eligible applicant whose vessel meets the requirements in the table at paragraph (k)(4)(i)(A) of this section, and the requirements in the table at any of the paragraphs (k)(4)(ii)(C) through (O) of this section, except:

      (A) From whose vessel no documented harvests were made in the GOA or waters shoreward of the GOA during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 27, 1992, and

      (B) From whose vessel no documented harvests were made in the BSAI or waters shoreward of the BSAI during the period beginning January 1, 1992, through June 17, 1995.

      (v) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section, a groundfish license with the appropriate area endorsements will be issued to an eligible applicant whose vessel meets the requirements in the tables at paragraphs (k)(4)(i) and (k)(4)(ii) and (A) or (B) of this section, except:

      (A) From whose vessel no documented harvests were made in the BSAI or waters shoreward of the BSAI during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 27, 1992, and

      (B) From whose vessel no documented harvests were made in the GOA or waters shoreward of the GOA during the period beginning January 1, 1992, through June 17, 1995.

      (vi)  (A) NMFS will revoke any trawl gear designation on a groundfish license with an Aleutian Island, Bering Sea, Central Gulf, or Western Gulf regulatory area unless one of the following conditions apply:

      () A person made at least two legal landings using trawl gear under the authority of that groundfish license in that regulatory area during the period from January _1_, 2000, through December 31, 2006; or

      () That trawl gear designation endorsed in that area is exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4)(vi)(A) as described under paragraphs (k)(4)(vii) or (k)(4)(viii) of this section.

      (B) NMFS shall assign a legal landing to a groundfish license for an area based only on information contained in the official record described in paragraph (k)(4)(x) of this section.

      (vii)  (A) Trawl gear designations with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area endorsements on a groundfish license that was derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel are exempt from the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section.

      (B) Trawl gear designations with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area endorsements on a groundfish license are exempt from the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section provided that all of the following conditions apply:

      () The groundfish license was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel;

      () The groundfish license is assigned to an AFA vessel on August 14, _2_009; and

      () No other groundfish license with a Bering Sea or Aleutian Island area endorsement is assigned to that AFA vessel on August 14, 2009.

      (C) Trawl gear designations with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area endorsements on a groundfish license that is listed in Column C of Table 31 to this part are exempt from the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section.

      (D) A trawl gear designation with Central Gulf area endorsement on a groundfish license that is assigned Rockfish QS is exempt from the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section.

      (viii)  A trawl gear designation with a Central Gulf or Western Gulf area endorsement on a groundfish license is exempt from the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section provided that a person made at least 20 legal landings under the authority of that groundfish license in either the Central Gulf or Western Gulf area using trawl gear during the period from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007.

      (ix)  (A) If a non-AFA catcher vessel that is less than 60 feet LOA was used to make at least 500 mt of legal landings of Pacific cod using trawl gear from the waters that were open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season adjacent to the Aleutian Islands Subarea during the period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006, according to the official record, NMFS shall issue an Aleutian Island area endorsement with a trawl gear designation to a groundfish license assigned to the vessel owner according to the official record, provided that the groundfish license assigned to that non-AFA catcher vessel meets all of the following requirements:

      () It was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel;

      () It has a trawl gear designation;

      () It does not have a catcher/processor vessel designation; and

      () That groundfish license has an MLOA of less than 60 feet.

      (B) If a non-AFA catcher vessel that is equal to or greater than 60 feet LOA was used to make at least one legal landing in State of Alaska waters adjacent to the Aleutian Islands Subarea using trawl gear during the period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006, or one landing of Pacific cod from the State of Alaska Pacific cod fishery during the period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006, according to the official record, NMFS shall issue an Aleutian Island area endorsement with a trawl gear designation to a groundfish license assigned to the vessel owner according to the official record, provided that the groundfish license assigned to that non-AFA catcher vessel meets the following criteria:

      () It was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel;

      () It has a trawl gear designation;

      () It does not have a catcher/processor vessel designation; and

      () At least 1,000 mt of legal landings of Pacific cod using trawl gear in the BSAI were made under the authority of that groundfish license during the period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006, according to the official record.

      (C) NMFS will assign the AI endorsement to an eligible groundfish license held and designated by the vessel owner beginning on August 14, 2009.

      (D) If the vessel owner does not hold a groundfish license to which an AI endorsement may be assigned on August 14, 2009 according to the official record, the vessel owner will have the opportunity to amend the official record as described in paragraph (k)(4)(x) of this section to designate an otherwise eligible groundfish license. If the official record is subsequently amended, NMFS will assign the AI endorsement to the groundfish license specified in the amended official record.

      (x)  (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator to determine the following:

      () The number of legal landings assigned to a groundfish license for purposes of the trawl gear designation participation requirements described in paragraph (k)(4)(vi) of this section;

      () The amount of legal landings assigned to a groundfish license for purposes of the AI endorsements described in paragraph (k)(4)(ix) of this section;

      () The owner of a vessel that has made legal landings that may generate an AI endorsement as described in paragraph (k)(4)(ix) of this section; and

      () All other relevant information necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraphs (k)(_4_)(vi) through (k)(4)(ix) of this section.

      (B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish license holder has the burden to prove otherwise. For the purposes of creating the official record, the Regional Administrator will presume the following:

      () A groundfish license is presumed to have been used onboard the same vessel from which that groundfish license was derived, the original qualifying vessel, during the calendar years 2000 and 200_1_, unless clear and unambiguous written documentation is provided that establishes otherwise;

      () If more than one person is claiming the same legal landing, then each groundfish license for which the legal landing is being claimed will be credited with the legal landing;

      () The groundfish license to which an AI endorsement described in paragraph (k)(4)(ix) of this section will be initially assigned.

      (C) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska fish tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to assign legal landings to a groundfish license.

      (D) The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.

      (E) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support a person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.

      (5)  A crab species license will be issued to an eligible applicant who owned a vessel that meets the criteria in paragraphs (k)(5)(i), (k)(5)(ii), and (k)(5)(iii) of this section, except that vessels are exempt from the requirements in paragraph (k)(5)(i) of this section for area/species endorsements at paragraphs (A) and (G) in the table at paragraph (k)(5)(ii) of this section.

      (i)  To qualify for one or more of the area/species endorsements in the table at paragraph (k)(5)(ii) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (k)(5)(iii) of this section must be met and:

      (A) At least one documented harvest of any amount of crab species must have been made from a vessel between January 1, 1988, and June 27, 1992; or

      (B) At least one documented harvest of any amount of crab species must have been made from a vessel between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994, providing that, during the period January 1, 1988, through February 9, 1992, the vessel for which the documented harvest was made also made a legal landing of any groundfish species harvested in the GOA or BSAI with any authorized gear, except sablefish caught with fixed gear, and, during the period February 10, 1992, through December 11, 1994, made a legal landing of any king or Tanner crab species harvested in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area.

      (ii)  This table provides the documented harvest requirements for LLP crab license area/species endorsements:

      (iii) Recent participation period (RPP). (A) The RPP is the period from January 1, 1996, through February 7, 1998. To qualify for a crab species license, defined at § 679.2, a person must have made at least one documented harvest of any amount of LLP crab species from a vessel during the RPP and must have held a LLP qualifying fishing history at the time of that documented harvest. A LLP qualifying fishing history meets the documented harvest requirements at paragraphs (k)(5)(i) and (k)(5)(ii) of this section.

      (B)  A person does not need to meet the documented harvest requirements in paragraph (k)(5)(iii)(A) of this section if he or she deployed a vessel that met the documented harvest requirements in paragraph (k)(5)(i) of this section, if applicable, paragraph (k)(5)(ii) of this section, and:

      () Only qualifies area/species endorsement at paragraph (G) in the table at paragraph (k)(5)(ii).

      () Those documented harvests were made from a vessel that meets the requirements for vessel length category “C”.

      () The vessel used to meet the document harvest requirements in paragraphs (k) (5) (i) and (k) (5) (ii) of this section was lost or destroyed, and he or she made a documented harvest of crab species any time during the period beginning after the vessel was lost or destroyed but before January 1, 2000.

      (iv) Exception to allow purchase of LLP qualifying fishing history after the documented harvest in the RPP. To qualify for a LLP crab species license, a person who made a documented harvest of LLP crab species during the period from January 1, 1998, through February 7, 1998, must have obtained, or entered into a contract to obtain, the LLP qualifying fishing history by 8:36 a.m. Alaska local time on October 10, 1998,

      (v) A qualified person who owned a vessel on June 17, 1995, that met the requirements in paragraphs (k)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, but whose vessel was unable to meet requirements of paragraph (k)(5)(iii) of this section because of unavoidable circumstances (, the vessel was lost damaged, or otherwise unable to participate in the license limitation crab fisheries) may receive a license if the qualified person is able to demonstrate that:

      (A) The owner of the vessel at the time of the unavoidable circumstance held a specific intent to conduct fishing for license limitation crab species with that vessel during a specific time period in a specific area;

      (B) The specific intent to conduct directed fishing for license limitation crab species was thwarted by a circumstance that was:

      () Unavoidable;

      () Unique to the owner of that vessel, or unique to that vessel; and

      () Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the owner of the vessel;

      (C) The circumstance that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation crab species actually occurred;

      (D) Under the circumstances, the owner of the vessel took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstances that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation crab species; and

      (E) Any amount of license limitation crab species was harvested on the vessel after the vessel was prevented from participating but before January 1, 2000.

      (vi) A groundfish license or crab species license may be used on a vessel that is named on the license, that complies with the vessel designation, and that does not exceed the MLOA on the license.

      (6) —(i)  The Regional Administrator will issue a groundfish license or a crab species license to an applicant if a complete application is submitted by or on behalf of the applicant during the specified application period, and if that applicant meets all the criteria for eligibility in paragraph (k) of this section. An application that is postmarked or delivered after the ending date for the application period for the License Limitation Program specified in the  will be denied. An application form will be sent to the last known address of a person identified as an eligible applicant by the official LLP record. An application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.

      (ii)  An application period of no less than 90 days will be specified by notification in the  and other information sources deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator.

      (iii)  To be complete, an application for a groundfish license or a crab species license must be signed by the applicant, or the individual representing the applicant, and contain the following, as applicable:

      (A) Name, business address, telephone number, and FAX number of the applicant;

      (B) Name, state registration number (e.g., ADF&G number), and, if applicable, the USCG documentation number of the vessel being used as the basis for eligibility for a license; and name, state registration number (e.g., ADF&G number), and, if applicable, the USCG documentation number of the vessel to be deployed with the license if different than the vessel used as the basis of eligibility for a license;

      (C) Name of the managing company, if any;

      (D) Valid evidence of the documented harvests that are the basis of eligibility for a license, including harvest area, gear used, date of landing, and, if applying for a crab species license, species;

      (E) Valid evidence of LOA on June 24, 1992, of the vessel used as the basis of eligibility for a license, except if that vessel was under reconstruction on that date, valid evidence of LOA on the date reconstruction was completed and valid evidence of when reconstruction began and ended;

      (F) Valid evidence of LOA on June 17, 1995, of the vessel used as the basis of eligibility for a license, except if that vessel was under reconstruction on that date, valid evidence of LOA on the date reconstruction was completed, and valid evidence of when reconstruction began and ended;

      (G) Valid evidence to support the applicant's claim for a vessel designation of catcher vessel or catcher/processor vessel;

      (H) Valid evidence of ownership of the vessel being used as the basis for eligibility for a license (for USCG documented vessels, valid evidence must be the USCG Abstract of Title), or if eligibility is based on a fishing history that has been separated from a vessel, valid evidence of ownership of the fishing history being used as the basis of eligibility for a license; and

      (I) Valid evidence of the LOA of the vessel to be deployed by the license if different than the vessel used as the basis for eligibility for a license.

      (iv)

      (A)  If an applicant is applying as the successor-in-interest to an eligible applicant, an application, to be complete, also must contain valid evidence proving the applicant's status as a successor-in-interest to that eligible applicant and:

      () Valid evidence of the death of that eligible applicant at the time of application, if the eligible applicant was or is an individual; or

      () Valid evidence that the eligible applicant is no longer in existence at the time of application, if the eligible applicant is not an individual.

      (B)  If an applicant is applying for a crab species license endorsement for Norton Sound and if the applicant is a person, an application, to be complete, must contain valid evidence that the applicant was a State of Alaska permit holder for the Norton Sound king crab summer fishery in 1993 or 1994. If the applicant is a corporation, an application, to be complete, must contain valid evidence that the corporation owned or had a lease for a vessel on June 17, 1995, that participated in the Norton Sound king crab summer fishery in 1993 or 1994.

      (C)  If an applicant is applying for a license based on meeting the general qualification period requirements of paragraph (k)(4)(i)(A)() or (k)(4)(i)(B)() of this section, the application, to be complete, must indicate which single endorsement area the applicant has selected for license. A license cannot be endorsed for more than one area, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant may have the documented harvests to qualify for more than one endorsement area.

      (D)  If a person is claiming that unavoidable circumstances prevented him or her from meeting certain eligibility requirements for a license under paragraph (k) of this section, he or she must provide the information required in the particular paragraph of this section authorizing such a claim, and include valid evidence of the date the vessel was lost, damaged, or otherwise unable to participate in the fishery, and the date a documented harvest was made after the vessel was unable to participate in the fishery by the unavoidable circumstance.

      (v)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate an application submitted during the specified application period and compare all claims in the application with the information in the official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified by evidence, will not be accepted. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section, an applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraphs (k)(6)(iii) and (k)(6)(iv) of this section, will be provided a 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct.

      (vi)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the official LLP record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP record.

      (vii)  The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 60-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record, if the Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the burden of proving that the information on the application is correct through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (k)(6)(iii) and (k)(6)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that information. An applicant will be limited to one _60-day evidentiary period._ Additional information or evidence, or a revised application, received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.

      (viii)  The Regional will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the application.

      (ix)  The Regional Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant on issuance of an IAD if required by the license renewal provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a person to deploy a vessel to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species as specified on the non-transferable license, and will have the specific endorsements and designations based on the claims in his or her application. A non-transferable license will expire upon final agency action.

      (x)  A groundfish or crab LLP license may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. A surrendered groundfish or crab LLP license will cease to exist and will not be subsequently reissued.

      (xi)  Endorsements specified on a groundfish LLP license are not severable from a license and cannot be surrendered except that pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on groundfish LLP licenses listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part, can be permanently surrendered, removed, and extinguished if:

      (A) The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS permanently remove and extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on that LLP license and acknowledges in that written request that the surrender and removal are permanent and irreversible and that all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements on that LLP license are extinguished;

      (B) The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS assign a 220-foot (67 m) MLOA on that LLP license;

      (C) The holder of the eligible LLP license, or the authorized agent, signs the request;

      (D) NMFS receives the written request to permanently remove and extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on the LLP groundfish license by February 6, 2017; and

      (E) The written request is submitted to NMFS using one of the following methods:

      () Mail: Regional Administrator, c/o Restricted Access Management Program, NMFS, P.O. Box 2_1_668, Juneau, AK 99802-1668;

      () Fax: 907-586-7354; or

      () Hand delivery or carrier: NMFS, Room 71_3_, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801.

      (7) —(i)  The Regional Administrator will transfer a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license if a complete transfer application is submitted to Restricted Access Management, Alaska Region, NMFS, and if the transfer meets the eligibility criteria as specified in paragraph (k)(7)(ii) of this section. A transfer application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.

      (ii)  A groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or crab species license can be transferred if the following conditions are met:

      (A) The designated transferee is eligible to document a fishing vessel under Chapter 121, Title 46, U.S.C.;

      (B) The parties to the transfer do not have any fines, civil penalties, other payments due and outstanding, or outstanding permit sanctions resulting from Federal fishing violations;

      (C) The transfer will not cause the designated transferee to exceed the license caps in § 679.7(i); and

      (D) The transfer does not violate any other provision specified in this part.

      (iii)  To be complete, an application for a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section transfer, or a crab species license transfer must be legible, have dated signatures of the applicants, and the applicants must attest that, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all statements in the application are true. An application to transfer will be provided by NMFS, or is available on the NMFS Alaska Region website at  The acceptable submittal methods will be specified on the application form.

      (iv)  The Regional Administrator will return an incomplete transfer application to the applicant and identify any deficiencies if the Regional Administrator determines that the application does not meet all the criteria identified in paragraph (k)(7) of this section.

      (v)  The Regional Administrator will transfer a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license based on a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement if the Regional Administrator determines that the transfer application is complete and the transfer will not violate any of the provisions of this section.

      (vi)  A groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license may be voluntarily transferred only once in any calendar year. A voluntary transfer is a transfer other than one pursuant to a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement. An application for transfer that would cause a person to exceed the transfer limit of this provision will not be approved. A transfer of an Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section to another LLP license, or the transfer of a groundfish license with an Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section attached to it will be considered to be a transfer of that Aleutian Island area endorsement.

      (vii)  (A) A request to change the vessel designated on an LLP groundfish or crab species license must be made on a transfer application. If this request is approved and made separately from a license transfer, it will count towards the annual limit on voluntary transfers specified in paragraph (k)(7)(vi) of this section.

      (B) A request to change the vessel designated on an Amendment 80 LLP license or an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license must be made on an Application for Amendment 80 Replacement Vessel in accordance with § 679.4(o)(4)(ii). The MLOA modification specified at paragraph (k)(3)(i)(C) of this section will be effective when a complete application is submitted to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (k)(7) of this section, and the application is approved by the Regional Administrator.

      (viii)  (A) Area endorsements or area/species endorsements specified on a license are not severable from the license and must be transferred together, except that Aleutian Island area endorsements on a groundfish license with a trawl gear designation issued under the provisions of paragraph (k)(4)(ix)(A) of this section and that are assigned to a groundfish license with an MLOA of less than 60 feet LOA may be transferred separately from the groundfish license to which that Aleutian Island area endorsement was originally issued to another groundfish license provided that the groundfish license to which that Aleutian Island endorsement is transferred:

      () Was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel;

      () Has a catcher vessel designation;

      () Has a trawl gear designation;

      () Has an MLOA of less than 60 feet LOA; and

      () A complete transfer application is submitted to the Regional Administrator as described under this paragraph (k)(7), and that application is approved.

      (B) A groundfish license and a crab species license issued based on the legal landings of the same vessel and initially issued to the same qualified person are not severable and must be transferred together.

      (ix)  The transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, must be accompanied by the vessel from which the documented harvests were made or its replacement vessel, or if the LLP license and vessel were separated by transfer prior to February 7, 1998, then by the vessel that is currently being deployed by the license holder. The Regional Administrator will deny a transfer application that requests the transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, if the appropriate vessel is not being transferred as part of the same transaction. A license holder of an LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, may replace the vessel from which the documented harvests were made with another vessel that meets the vessel designation and MLOA requirements specified on the LLP license if the original qualifying vessel is lost or destroyed.

      (8)  (i) Any person committing, or a fishing vessel used in the commission of, a violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act or any regulations issued pursuant thereto, is subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and the civil forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, part 621 of this chapter, 15 CFR part 904 (Civil Procedure), and other applicable law. Penalties include, but are not limited to, permanent or temporary sanctions to licenses.

      (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of the license limitation program in this part, vessels fishing for species other than license limitation groundfish as defined in § 679.2 that were authorized under Federal regulations to incidentally catch license limitation groundfish without a Federal fisheries permit described at § 679.4(b) will continue to be authorized to catch the maximum retainable bycatch amounts of license limitation groundfish as provided in this part without a groundfish license.

      (iii) An eligible applicant, who qualifies for a groundfish license or crab species license but whose vessel on which the eligible applicant's qualification was based was lost or destroyed, will be issued a license. This license:

      (A) Will have the vessel designation of the lost or destroyed vessel.

      (B) Cannot be used to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or to conduct directed fishing for crab species on a vessel that has an LOA greater than the MLOA designated on the license.

      (iv) A qualified person who owned a vessel on June 17, 1995, that made a documented harvest of license limitation groundfish, or crab species if applicable, between January 1, 1988, and February 9, 1992, but whose vessel was unable to meet all the criteria in paragraph (k)(4) of this section for a groundfish license or paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a crab species license because of an unavoidable circumstance (, the vessel was lost, damaged, or otherwise unable to participate in the license limitation groundfish or crab fisheries) may receive a license if the qualified person is able to demonstrate that:

      (A) The owner of the vessel at the time of the unavoidable circumstance held a specific intent to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species with that vessel during a specific time period in a specific area.

      (B) The specific intent to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species with that vessel was thwarted by a circumstance that was:

      () Unavoidable.

      () Unique to the owner of that vessel, or unique to that vessel.

      () Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the owner of the vessel.

      (C) The circumstance that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species actually occurred.

      (D) Under the circumstances, the owner of the vessel took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species.

      (E) Any amount of license limitation groundfish or appropriate crab species was harvested on the vessel in the specific area that corresponds to the area endorsement or area/species endorsement for which the qualified person who owned a vessel on June 17, 1995, is applying and that the license limitation groundfish or crab species was harvested after the vessel was prevented from participating by the unavoidable circumstance but before June 17, 1995.

A license holder can only use the specific non-trawl gear(s) indicated on his or her license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the BSAI.

      (ii)  This table provides eligibility requirements for Pacific cod endorsements on an LLP groundfish license:

      (iii)  (A) All eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section will be determined based on round weight equivalents.

      (B) Discards will not count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section.

      (C) Pacific cod harvested for personal bait use will not count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section.

      (D) A legal landing of Pacific cod in the BSAI for commercial bait will count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section.

      (E) Harvests within the BSAI will count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section; however, a license holder will only be able to harvest Pacific cod in the specific areas in the BSAI for which he or she has an area endorsement.

      (F) Harvests within the BSAI Would count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section if:

      () Those harvests were made from the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's LLP groundfish license, or

      () Those harvests were made from a vessel that was not the vessel used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's LLP groundfish license, provided that, at the time the endorsement-qualifying Pacific cod harvests were made, the person who owned such Pacific cod endorsement-qualifying fishing history also owned the fishing history of a vessel that satisfied the requirements for the LLP groundfish license.

      () Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (k)(9)(iii)(F)() of this section, the LLP groundfish license qualifying history or the Pacific cod qualifying history of any one vessel may not be used to satisfy the requirements for issuance of more than one LLP groundfish license endorsed for the BSAI Pacific cod hook-and-line or pot gear fisheries.

      (A)  A license holder may combine the landings of a sunken vessel and the landings of a vessel obtained to replace a sunken vessel to satisfy the eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section only if he or she meets the requirements in paragraphs (k)(9)(v)(A)()-() of this section. No other combination of landings will satisfy the eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section.

      () The sunken vessel was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license;

      () The sunken vessel sank after January 1, 1995;

      () The vessel obtained to replace the sunken vessel was obtained by December _3_1 of the year 2 years after the sunken vessel sank; and

      () The length of the vessel obtained to replace the sunken vessel does not exceed the MLOA specified on the license holder's groundfish license.

      (B)  A license holder may be eligible for a Pacific cod endorsement because of unavoidable circumstances if he or she meets the requirements in paragraphs (k)(9)(v)(B)()-() of this section. For purposes of this hardship provision, the term license holder includes the person whose landings were used to meet the eligibility requirements for the license holder's groundfish license, if not the same person.

      () The license holder at the time of the unavoidable circumstance held a specific intent to conduct directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section but that this intent was thwarted by a circumstance that was:

      () Unavo_i_dable;

      () Unique to the license holder, or unique to the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license; and

      () Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the license holder.

      () The circumstance that prevented the license holder from conducting directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(9)(ii) actually occurred;

      () The license holder took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the license holder from conducting directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section; and

      () Any amount of Pacific cod was harvested in the BSAI aboard the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license after the vessel was prevented from participating by the unavoidable circumstance but before April 16, 2000.

      (10) —(i)  In addition to other requirements of this part, and unless specifically exempted in paragraph (k)(10)(iv) of this section, a license holder must have a Pacific cod endorsement on his or her groundfish license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western Gulf of Alaska or Central Gulf of Alaska with hook-and-line gear, pot gear, or jig gear on a vessel using more than five jig machines, more than one line per machine, and more than 30 hooks per line. A license holder can only use the specific non-trawl gear(s) indicated on his or her license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western Gulf of Alaska or Central Gulf of Alaska.

      (D) If a groundfish license meets the criteria described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(B)() of this section and NMFS has redesignated the MLOA of that groundfish license based on those criteria, then NMFS may assign a non-trawl Pacific cod endorsement with the specific gear designation(s) and regulatory area(s) applicable to the redesignated MLOA of that groundfish license based on the eligibility criteria established in paragraph (k)(10)(ii) of this section; and

      (E) NMFS may issue groundfish licenses with non-trawl Pacific cod endorsements to CQEs as specified in paragraph (k)(10)(vi) of this section.

      (iv)  Any vessel exempted from the License Limitation Program at paragraph (k)(2) of this section.

      (v)  (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator to determine the following:

      () All other relevant information necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(B) and (k)(10) of this section.

      (B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.

      (C) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska fish tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to assign legal landings to a groundfish license.

      (D) If more than one groundfish license holder is claiming the same legal landing because their groundfish license designated the vessel at the time that the legal landing was made, then each groundfish license for which the legal landing is being claimed will be credited with the legal landing.

      (E) The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination (IAD).

      (F) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or with the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.

      (vi)  (A) Each CQE that has been approved by the Regional Administrator under the requirements of § 679.41(l)(3) to represent a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 that is eligible for Pacific cod endorsed non-trawl groundfish licenses, may apply to receive the maximum number of groundfish licenses listed in Table 21 to part 679 on behalf of the eligible communities listed in Table 21 to part 679 that CQE is designated to represent.

      (D) The CQE must provide a copy of the annual CQE authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter that is made by the CQE to NMFS and the vessel operator prior to the person(s) designated in the authorization letter using that groundfish license aboard a vessel. The vessel operator must maintain a copy of the annual CQE authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter that is made by the CQE onboard the vessel when that vessel is directed fishing for Pacific cod under the authority of that groundfish license. The authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.

      (E) The CQE must attest in the annual CQE authorization letter, or any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter, that the person(s) using a groundfish license issued to a CQE:

      () Is a citizen of the United States;

      () Has maintained a domicile in a CQE community in the Central GOA or Western GOA eligible to receive an LLP license endorsed for Pacific cod for the 1_2_ consecutive months immediately preceding the time when the assertion of residence is made; and

If an application to receive a groundfish license with a Central Gulf of Alaska designation on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 is received later than six months after April 21, 2011, NMFS will issue an equal number of pot gear and hook-and-line gear Pacific cod endorsements for a groundfish license issued to the CQE on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679. In cases where the total number of groundfish licenses issued on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 is not even, NMFS will issue one more groundfish license with a pot gear Pacific cod endorsement than the number of groundfish licenses with a hook-and-line gear Pacific cod endorsement.

      (G) An annual report on the use of Pacific cod endorsed non-trawl groundfish licenses shall be submitted by the CQE as required at § 679.5(t).

      (vii) —(A)  A license limitation groundfish license holder can elect to permanently add a catcher vessel endorsement for Pacific cod for the same gears and areas for which the license is currently endorsed, for the Western and/or Central GOA if the license holder—

      () Or, is the holder of a license limitation groundfish license endorsed for trawl gear Western and/or Central GOA and made a minimum of one Pacific cod landing while operating as a catcher vessel under the authority of the catcher/processor license in Federal reporting areas 610, 620, or 630, from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2008.

      (B)  Any holder of an LLP license that has a catcher vessel endorsement for the Western and/or Central GOA under paragraph (k)(10)(vii) of this section—

      () Will have all directed catch of Pacific cod harvested under the authority of that groundfish license accrue against the respective GOA regulatory area catcher vessel allocations; and

      () Will have all incidental catch of Pacific cod in the Western GOA or Central GOA Federal reporting areas 610, 6_2_0, or 630, harvested under the authority of that groundfish license accrue against the respective GOA regulatory area catcher vessel allocations.

      (C)  Any holder of an LLP license that does not have a catcher vessel endorsement for the Western and/or Central GOA under (k)(10)(vii) of this section may participate in the Western GOA or Central GOA directed Pacific cod fishery as a catcher/processor or a catcher vessel; however, direct and incidental catch of Pacific cod in the Western GOA and Central GOA will accrue against the respective catcher/processor allocation.

      (D)  For a vessel that does not meet the requirements at paragraph (k)(10)(vii) of this section but does have multiple, stacked, LLP licenses and one of those stacked licenses is endorsed as a catcher/processor eligible to harvest Pacific cod in the Western GOA or Central GOA Federal reporting areas 610, 620, or 630, all catch will accrue against the catcher/processor sector allocation for that gear type.

      (E)  NMFS will assign legal landings to each groundfish license for an area based only on information contained in the official record as described in paragraph (k)(10)(viii) of this section.

      (viii)  (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator to determine the following:

      () The number and amount of legal landings made under the authority of that license by gear type, and operational mode;

      () All other relevant information necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraphs (k)(_1_0)(vii)(A)() through (k)(10)(vii)(A)() of this section.

      (B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.

      (C) For the purposes of creating the official record, the Regional Administrator will presume if more than one person is claiming the same legal landing, that each groundfish license for which the legal landing is being claimed will be credited with the legal landing;

      (D) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska Fish Tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to assign legal landings to a groundfish license.

      (E) The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period.

      (F) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD that is accepted by the National Appeals Office will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.

      (11)  No person may use an LLP license that was derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA catcher vessel or a listed AFA catcher/processor to fish for groundfish or crab on a non-AFA catcher vessel or non-AFA catcher/processor. NMFS will identify all such licenses affected by this restriction and inform the holders of such licenses of this restriction through a restriction printed on the face of the license.

      (12) —(i)  In addition to other requirements of this part, a license holder must have rockfish QS assigned to his or her groundfish LLP license to conduct directed fishing for rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species with trawl gear.

A vessel designated on a groundfish LLP license with trawl and catcher/processor vessel designations and a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement may operate as a catcher vessel and deliver its catch of yellowfin sole harvested in the directed BSAI TLAS fishery to a mothership, or operate as a catcher/processor and catch and process its own catch in this fishery.

      (ii)  (A) A groundfish LLP license is eligible to receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement if the groundfish LLP license:

      () Had a vessel designated on it, in any year from 2008 through 20_1_5, that made at least one legal trip target landing of yellowfin sole in the BSAI TLAS directed fishery to a mothership in any one year from 2008 through 2015, inclusive, where a trip target is the groundfish species for which the retained amount of that groundfish species is greater than the retained amount of any other groundfish species for that trip;

      () Has a Bering Sea area endorsement and a trawl gear designation; and

      () Is credited by NMFS with a legal trip target landing specified in paragraph (k)(_1_4)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      (B) If a vessel specified in paragraph (k)(__1__4)(ii)(A)() of this section was designated on more than one groundfish LLP license from 2008 through 2015 and made at least one legal trip target landing in a BSAI TLAS directed fishery from 2008 through 2015, the vessel owner must specify to NMFS only one of those groundfish LLP licenses to receive credit with the legal trip target landing(s) specified in paragraph (k)(14)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      (iii)  (A) NMFS will determine whether a groundfish LLP license is eligible to receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement under paragraph (k)(14)(ii) of this section based only on information contained in the official record described in paragraph (k)(14)(v) of this section.

      (B) NMFS will credit a groundfish LLP license with a legal trip target landing specified in paragraph (k)(___1___4)(ii)(A)() of this section if that groundfish LLP license was the only groundfish LLP license on which the vessel was designated from 2008 through 2015. If a vessel that made at least one legal trip target landing specified in paragraph (k)(14)(ii)(A)() of this section was designated on more than one groundfish LLP license from 2008 through 2015 and made at least one legal trip target landing in a BSAI TLAS directed fishery from 2008 through 2015, the vessel owner must notify NMFS which one of those groundfish LLP licenses NMFS is to credit with the legal trip target landing(s) specified in paragraph (k)(14)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      (C) Trip target landings will be determined based on round weight equivalents.

      (iv)  Any vessel exempted from the License Limitation Program at paragraph (k)(2) of this section is exempted from the requirement to have a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole endorsement to deliver catch of BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole to a mothership for processing.

      (v)  (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator that is necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraph (k)(14) of this section.

      (B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish LLP license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.

      (C) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska fish tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to determine legal trip target landings under paragraph (k)(_1_4)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      (vi)  (A) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license endorsed to use trawl gear in the Bering Sea and designated in Column A of Table 52 to this part a notice of eligibility to receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement and a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement.

      (B) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license endorsed to use trawl gear in the Bering Sea and designated in Column A of Table 53 to this part a notice of eligibility to be credited with a legal trip target landing specified in (k)(_1_4)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      () NMFS will also issue to the owner of the vessel designated on the groundfish LLP licenses in Column A of Table 53 a notice of eligibility for the two listed groundfish LLP licenses to be credited with a legal trip target landing specified in (k)(___1___4)(ii)(A)() of this section. The notice to the vessel owner will provide instructions for the vessel owner to select the one groundfish LLP license that NMFS is to credit with the legal trip target landing specified in (k)(14)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      () The holder of a groundfish LLP license in Column A of Table 53 will receive a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement if:

      () The owner of the vessel des_i_gnated on the groundfish LLP license requests in writing that NMFS credit that groundfish LLP license with the legal trip target landing specified in paragraph (k)(_1_4)(ii)(A)() of this section;

      () The written request is submitted to NMFS using one of the following methods: Mail at Regional Administrator, c/o Restricted Access Management Program, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802-1668; fax at 907-586-7352; or hand delivery or carrier at NMFS, Room 713, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801;  and

      () NMFS rece_iv_es the written request and credits the groundfish LLP license with the legal trip target landing specified in paragraph (k)(_1_4)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      () The holder of a groundfish LLP license in Column A of Table 5_3_ that is not selected by the vessel owner will receive a notice, using the address on record at the time the notification is sent, informing the holder that the groundfish LLP license was not selected by the vessel owner, will not be credited with a legal trip target landing, and will not receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole endorsement. The notice will inform the holder of the groundfish LLP license of the timing and process through which the holder can provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record of this section as specified in paragraphs (k)(14)(vi)(D) and (E) of this section.

      (C) NMFS will issue to the holder of a groundfish LLP license with a Bering Sea trawl designation and that is not listed in either Table 52 or 53 a notice informing that holder that the groundfish LLP license is not eligible to be credited with a legal trip target landing or receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement based on the official record, using the address on record at the time the notification is sent.

Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination (IAD).

      (E) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period, if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information or evidence submitted. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to 15 CFR part 906. NMFS will issue a non-transferable interim license that is effective until final agency action on the IAD to an applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD and who has a credible claim to eligibility for a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole endorsement.

      (15) —(i)  In addition to other requirements of this part, a catcher/processor must be designated on a groundfish LLP license that has a _BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement_ in order to receive and process Pacific cod harvested and delivered by a catcher vessel directed fishing in the BSAI non-CDQ Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel fishery as specified in § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A). A catcher/processor designated on a groundfish LLP license with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area, catcher/processor operation, and BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsements may operate as a mothership, as defined at § 679.2, to receive and process Pacific cod harvested by a catcher vessel directed fishing in the BSAI non-CDQ Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel fishery as specified in § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A).

      (ii)  A groundfish LLP license is eligible to receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement if the groundfish LLP license:

      (A) Has Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area and catcher/processor operation endorsements;

      (B) Had a catcher/processor designated on it that received and processed at least one legal mothership trip target of Pacific cod delivered from a catcher vessel directed fishing in the BSAI non-CDQ Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel fishery as specified in § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A) in each of the three years of the qualifying period of 2015 through 2017, inclusive, where a mothership trip target is, in the aggregate, the groundfish species that is delivered by a catcher vessel to a given catcher/processor acting as a mothership in an amount greater than the retained amount of any other groundfish species delivered by the same catcher vessel to the same catcher/processor for a given week; and

      (C) Is credited by NMFS with receiving a legal mothership trip target specified in paragraph (k)(15)(ii)(B) of this section.

      (iii)  (A) NMFS will determine whether a groundfish LLP license is eligible to receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement under paragraph (k)(15)(ii) of this section based only on information contained in the official record described in paragraph (k)(15)(iv) of this section.

      (B) NMFS will credit a groundfish LLP license with receipt of a legal mothership trip target specified in paragraph (k)(15)(ii)(B) of this section if that groundfish LLP license was the only groundfish LLP license on which the catcher/processor that received and processed legal mothership trip targets was designated from 2015 through 2017.

      (C) Mothership trip targets will be determined based on round weight equivalents.

      (iv)  (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator that is necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraph (k)(15) of this section.

      (B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish LLP license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.

      (C) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on NMFS production reports will be used to determine legal mothership trip targets under paragraph (k)(15)(ii)(B) of this section.

      (v)  (A) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area and catcher/processor operation endorsements, and specified in Column A of Table 57 of this part, a notice of eligibility to receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement and a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement.

      (B) NMFS will issue to the holder of a groundfish LLP license with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area and catcher/processor operation endorsements, and that is not listed in Table 57 of this part, a notice informing that holder that the groundfish LLP license is not eligible to be credited with at least one legal mothership trip target of Pacific cod in the BSAI non-CDQ Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel fishery for each year during the qualifying period or receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement based on the official record, using the address on record at the time the notice is sent. The notice specified in this paragraph (k)(15)(v)(B) will inform the holder of the groundfish LLP license of the timing and process through which the holder can provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record of this section, as specified in paragraphs (k)(15)(v)(C) and (D) of this section.

      (C) The Regional Administrator will specify by notice a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination (IAD).

      (D) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period, if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information or evidence submitted. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to 15 CFR part 906. NMFS will issue a non-transferable interim license that is effective until final agency action on the IAD to an applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD and who has a credible claim to eligibility for a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement.

      (16)  In addition to other requirements of this part, an LLP license holder must have PCTC Program QS assigned to their groundfish LLP license to join a PCTC Program cooperative to harvest Pacific cod.

      (l) —(1) —(i)  In addition to any other permit and licensing requirements set out in this part, any vessel used to engage in directed fishing for a non-CDQ allocation of pollock in the BS and any shoreside processor, stationary floating processor, or mothership that receives pollock harvested in a non-CDQ directed pollock fishery in the BS must have a valid AFA permit onboard the vessel or at the facility location at all times while non-CDQ pollock is being harvested or processed. In addition, the owner of any vessel that is a member of a pollock cooperative in the BS must also have a valid AFA permit for every vessel that is a member of the cooperative, regardless of whether or not the vessel actually engages in directed fishing for pollock in the BS. Finally, an AFA permit does not exempt a vessel operator, vessel, or processor from any other applicable permit or licensing requirement required under this part or in other state or Federal regulations.

      (ii) —(A)  All interim AFA vessel and processor permits issued prior to January 1, 2002, will expire on December 31, 2002, unless extended or re-issued by NMFS.

      (B)  () Except as provided in paragraphs (l)(_1_)(ii)(B)(), (l)(1)(ii)(B)(), (l)(5)(v)(B)(), and (l)(6)(iii) of this section, AFA vessel and processor permits issued under this paragraph (l) are valid indefinitely unless the permit is suspended or revoked.

      () An AFA vessel permit is revoked when the vessel designated on the permit is replaced or removed under paragraph (l)(7) of this section.

      () In the event of a total loss or constructive loss of an AFA vessel,

      () The AFA vessel perm_i_t that designates the lost AFA vessel will be valid from the date of the vessel loss up to 5 years from December 31 of the year in which the vessel was lost and will be suspended after that date, unless the AFA vessel permit for the lost vessel was revoked before that date because the lost vessel was replaced or removed under paragraph (l)(7) of this section. For example, if a vessel sinks on February 15, 2016, the AFA permit on the vessel will be valid until December 31, 2021, unless the owner of the vessel replaces or removes the vessel before December 31, 2021; after December 31, 2021, the AFA permit on the lost vessel will be suspended until the AFA vessel owner replaces or removes the lost vessel;

      () The owner of the lost AFA vessel must notify NMFS in writing of the vessel loss within 120 days of the date of the total loss or constructive loss of the vessel;

      () For purposes of paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B)() of this section, an AFA lost vessel is a vessel that has been subject to a total loss or a constructive loss; a total loss means that the vessel is physically lost such as from sinking or a fire; a constructive loss means that the vessel suffered damage so that the cost of repairing the vessel exceeded the value of the vessel; the date of the total loss of a vessel is the date on which the physical loss occurred; the date of the constructive loss of a vessel is the date on which the damage to the vessel occurred.

      (C)  Except for AFA inshore processor permits, AFA permits may not be surrendered.

      (iii)  NMFS will issue AFA vessel and processor permits to the current owner(s) of a qualifying vessel or processor if the owner(s) submits to the Regional Administrator a completed AFA permit application that is subsequently approved.

      (iv)  AFA vessel and processor permits may not be used on or transferred to any vessel or processor that is not listed on the permit. However, AFA permits may be amended by NMFS to reflect any change in the ownership of the vessel or processor after submittal of this information to NMFS in a written letter.

      (2) AFA catcher/processor permits—(i) Listed AFA catcher/processors. NMFS will issue to an owner of a catcher/processor a listed AFA catcher/processor permit if the catcher/processor is one of the following (as listed in AFA paragraphs 208(e)(1) through (20)):

      (v)  If the Council recommends and NMFS approves a combined BSAI pollock TAC that exceeds 1,274,900 mt for any fishing year, or in the event of the actual total loss or constructive loss of an existing AFA inshore processor, the Council may recommend that an additional inshore processor (or processors) be issued AFA inshore processing permits.

      (A)  At any time prior to or during a fishing year in which the combined BSAI pollock TAC exceeds 1,274,900 mt, or at any time after the actual total loss or constructive total loss of an existing AFA inshore processor, the Council may, after opportunity for public comment, recommend that an additional inshore processor (or processors) be issued AFA inshore processor permits.

      (B)  Any recommendation from the Council to add an additional inshore processor (or processors) must include the following information:

      ()  The Council recommendation must identify by name the inshore processor(s) to which AFA inshore processor permits would be issued;

      ()  The Council recommendation must specify whether the identified inshore processor(s) should be issued a restricted or unrestricted AFA inshore processor permit.

      ()  The Council recommendation must specify the recommended duration of the permit. Permit duration may be for any duration from a single fishing season to the duration of section 208 of the AFA. Alternatively, the Council may recommend that the permit be valid as long as the conditions that led to the permit remain in effect. For example, the Council could recommend that a permit issued under this paragraph remain valid as long as the combined annual BSAI pollock TAC remains above 1,274,900 mt. or a lost AFA inshore processor is not reconstructed.

      ()  The Council may establish additional procedures for the review and approval of requests to authorize additional AFA inshore processors. However, such procedures must be consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the national standards, and other applicable law.

      ()  Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Council to authorize additional AFA inshore processors, NMFS may issue an AFA inshore processor permit to the identified inshore processor(s) of the type and duration recommended by the Council, provided the Council has met the requirements identified in paragraphs (l)(_5_)(v)(B)() through () of this section, and the owner(s) of the identified inshore processor has submitted a completed application for an AFA inshore processor permit that is subsequently approved.

      (6) —(i)  NMFS will issue to an inshore catcher vessel cooperative formed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 521 for the purpose of cooperatively managing directed fishing for pollock for processing by an AFA inshore processor an AFA inshore cooperative fishing permit upon receipt and approval of a completed application.

      (ii)  A completed application for an inshore cooperative fishing permit must contain the following information:

      (A)  Name of cooperative; name of cooperative representative; and business mailing address, business telephone number, business fax number, and business e-mail address of the cooperative;

      (B)  The name and physical location of an AFA inshore processor that is designated in the cooperative contract as the processor to whom the cooperative has agreed to deliver at least 90 percent of its BS pollock catch;

#### § § 679.20

      This section applies to vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA and/or the BSAI and to vessels engaged in commercial fishing for Arctic fish in the Arctic Management Area.

      (a) —(1) —(i)  The _OY_ for BSAI and GOA target species is a range or specific amount that can be harvested consistently with this part, plus the amounts of “nonspecified species” taken incidentally to the harvest of target species. The species categories are defined in Table 1 of the specifications as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (A) The OY for groundfish in the BSAI regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 1.4 million to 2.0 million mt.

      (B) The OY for groundfish in the GOA regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 116,000 to 800,000 mt.

      (ii)  The OY for each target fish species identified in the Fishery Management Plan for Fish Resources of the Arctic Management Area regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 0 mt.

      (2)  NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will specify and apportion the annual TAC and reserves for each calendar year among the GOA and BSAI target species. TACs in the target species category may be split or combined for purposes of establishing new TACs with apportionments thereof under paragraph (c) of this section. The sum of the TACs so specified must be within the OY range specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (3)  The annual determinations of TAC for each target species and the reapportionment of reserves may be adjusted, based upon a review of the following:

      (i)  Resource assessment documents prepared annually for the Council that provide information on historical catch trend; updated estimates of the MSY of the groundfish complex and its component species groups; assessments of the stock condition of each target species; assessments of the multispecies and ecosystem impacts of harvesting the groundfish complex at current levels, given the assessed condition of stocks, including consideration of rebuilding depressed stocks; and alternative harvesting strategies and related effects on the component species group.

      (ii)  Socioeconomic considerations that are consistent with the goals of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and the GOA, including the need to promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources, including minimizing costs; the need to manage for the optimum marketable size of a species; the impact of groundfish harvests on prohibited species and the domestic target fisheries that utilize these species; the desire to enhance depleted stocks; the seasonal access to the groundfish fishery by domestic fishing vessels; the commercial importance of a fishery to local communities; the importance of a fishery to subsistence users; and the need to promote utilization of certain species.

      (4) —(i) —(A)  Vessels in the _Eastern GOA regulatory area_ using fixed gear will be allocated 95 percent of the sablefish TAC.

      (B)  Vessels in the Eastern GOA regulatory area using trawl gear will be allocated 5 percent of the sablefish TAC for bycatch in other trawl fisheries.

      (ii) —(A)  Vessels in the _Central and Western GOA regulatory areas_ using fixed gear will be allocated 80 percent of the sablefish TAC in each of the Central and Western GOA regulatory areas.

      (B)  Vessels using trawl gear will be allocated 20 percent of the sablefish TAC in these areas.

      (iii) —(A)  Vessels in the _Bering Sea subarea_ using fixed gear will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.

      (B)  Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using trawl gear will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.

      (iv) —(A)  Vessels in the _Aleutian Islands subarea_ using fixed gear will be allocated 75 percent of each TAC for sablefish.

      (B)  Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using trawl gear will be allocated 25 percent of each TAC for sablefish.

      (5) —(i) —(A)  The pollock TAC apportioned to the _Bering Sea Subarea_, after subtraction of the 10 percent CDQ reserve under § 679.31(a), will be allocated as follows:

      ()  The Regional Administrator will establish an incidental catch allowance to account for projected incidental catch of pollock by vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish other than pollock and by vessels harvesting non-pollock CDQ. If during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that the incidental catch allowance has been set too high or too low, he/she may issue inseason notification in the  that reallocates incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa, according to the proportions established under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section.

      ()  The remaining pollock TAC apportioned to the Bering Sea subarea is established as a directed fishing allowance.

      ()  Fifty percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher vessels harvesting pollock for processing by AFA inshore processors. The inshore allocation will be further divided into separate allocations for cooperative and open access fishing.

      ()  The _i_nshore cooperative allocation will be equal to the aggregate annual allocations of all AFA inshore catcher vessel cooperatives that receive pollock allocations under § 679.62(a).

      ()  The inshore open access allocation will equal that portion of the inshore sector allocation that is not allocated to inshore cooperatives.

      ()  Forty percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher/processors and AFA catcher vessels delivering to catcher processors.

      ()  If by December 1 of the year pr_i_or to the year when fishing under the cooperative agreement will begin, NMFS receives filing of cooperative contracts and/or an inter-cooperative agreement entered into by listed AFA catcher/processors and all AFA catcher vessels with catcher/processor sector endorsements, and the Regional Administrator determines that such contracts provide for the distribution of harvest between catcher/processors and catcher vessels in a manner agreed to by all members of the catcher/processor sector cooperative(s), then NMFS will not subdivide the catcher/processor sector allocation between catcher vessels and catcher/processors.

      ()  If such contract is not filed with NMFS by December 1 of the preceding year, then NMFS will allocate 91.5 percent of the catcher/processor sector allocation to AFA catcher/processors engaged in directed fishing for pollock and 8.5 percent of the catcher/processor sector allocation to AFA catcher vessels delivering to catcher/processors.

      ()  Unlisted AFA catcher/processors will be limited to harvesting not more than 0.5 percent of catcher/processor sector allocation.

      ()  Ten percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher vessels harvesting pollock for processing by AFA motherships.

      ()  NMFS will establish an excessive harvesting share limit equal to 17.5 percent of the sum of the directed fishing allowances established under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section. The excessive harvesting share limit will be published in the annual harvest specifications and is subject to revision on an inseason basis if NMFS reallocates unharvested amounts of the incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa.

      ()  NMFS will establish an excessive processing share limit equal to 30.0 percent of the sum of the directed fishing allowances established under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section. The excessive processing share limit will be published in the annual harvest specifications and is subject to revision on an inseason basis if NMFS reallocates unharvested amounts of the incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa.

      (B) —()  The portions of the BS subarea pollock directed fishing allowances allocated to each sector under sections 206(a) and 206(b) of the AFA and the CDQ allowance in the BSAI will be divided into two seasonal allowances corresponding to the two fishing seasons set out at § 679.23(e)(2), as follows:

      () A Season, 45 percent;

      () B Season, 55 percent.

      ()  Within any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add or subtract any under harvest or over harvest of a seasonal allowance for a component to the subsequent seasonal allowance for the component through notification published in the

      (C)  For each component under Sections 206(a) and 206(b) of the AFA and for the open access fishery, no more than 28 percent of the annual pollock directed fishery allowance may be taken from the SCA before April 1. The SCA is defined at § 679.22(a)(7)(vii).

      (ii)  If the Bogoslof District is open to directed fishing for pollock by regulation, then the pollock TAC for this district will be allocated according to the same procedure established for the Bering Sea subarea at paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. If the Bogoslof District is closed to directed fishing for pollock by regulation, then the entire TAC for this district will be allocated as an incidental catch allowance.

      (iii)  (A) If a directed fishery for pollock in the AI is not specified under paragraph (c) of this section, then the entire TAC for this subarea will be allocated as an incidental catch allowance.

      (B) If the AI is open to directed fishing for pollock under paragraph (c) of this section, then the pollock TAC for this subarea will be specified, allocated, seasonally apportioned, and reallocated as follows:

      ()  When the AI pollock ABC is less than _1_9,000 mt, the annual TAC will be no greater than the ABC. When the AI pollock ABC equals or exceeds 19,000 mt, the annual TAC will be equal to 19,000 mt.

      () —()  10 percent of the annual TAC w_i_ll be allocated to the CDQ pollock reserve established under § 679.31(a)(_2_).

      ()  The Regional Administrator will determine the amount of the pollock incidental catch necessary to support an incidental catch allowance in the AI during the fishing year for each season. This amount of pollock will be deducted from the annual TAC. If during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that the incidental catch allowance is excessive or inadequate, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the excess of the incidental catch allowance to the directed pollock fishery, or may reallocate pollock from the directed pollock fishery to the incidental catch allowance as necessary to support incidental catch of pollock in AI groundfish fisheries, by publication in the

      ()  No greater than the lesser of the annual _i_nitial TAC plus any A season CDQ pollock directed fishery allowance or 40 percent of the AI pollock ABC. The total A season apportionment, including the AI directed pollock fishery allocation, the CDQ pollock directed fishery seasonal allowance, and the incidental catch amount, shall not exceed 40 percent of the ABC.

      ()  The B season apport_i_onment of the AI directed pollock fishery shall equal the annual initial TAC minus the A season directed pollock fishery apportionment under paragraph (a)(5)(__ii__i)(B)()() of this section and minus the incidental catch amount under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(B)()() of this section.

      ()  During any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add any under harvest of the A season directed pollock fishery apportionment to the B season directed pollock fishery apportionment by inseason notification published in the  if the Regional Administrator determines that the harvest capacity in the B season is sufficient to harvest the adjusted B season apportionment.

      ()  During any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add any under harvest of the A season incidental catch allowance apportionment to the B season incidental catch allowance apportionment by publication in the  if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional B season incidental catch allowance is necessary to support other groundfish fisheries.

      ()  As soon as practicable, if the Regional Administrator determines that vessels participating in either the AI directed pollock fishery or the AI CDQ directed pollock fishery likely will not harvest the entire AI directed pollock fishery or CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance, the Regional Administrator may reallocate some or all of the projected unused directed pollock fishery allocation to the Bering Sea subarea directed pollock fishery or AI CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance to the Bering Sea subarea CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance by inseason notification published in the

      ()  The annual allocation for vessels 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA or less participating in the AI directed pollock fishery will be:

      () No more than 25 percent of the AI d_i_rected pollock fishery allocation through 2008;

      () No more than 50 percent of the AI directed pollock fishery allocation from 2009 through 2012; and

      () 50 percent of the AI directed pollock fishery allocation in 2013 and beyond.

      ()  Pollock harvests during the A season as defined at § _6_79.23(e)(2) are limited to:

      () No more than 5 percent of the Aleut_i_an Islands pollock ABC in Area 543.

      () No more than 15 percent of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC in Area 542.

      () No more than 30 percent of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC in Area 541.

      (iv) —(A)  The TAC for pollock in the combined _GOA_ Western and Central Regulatory Areas will be apportioned among statistical areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the distribution of the pollock biomass as determined by the most recent NMFS surveys.

      (B)  Each apportionment established under paragraph (a)(5)(iv)(A) of this section will be divided into two seasonal apportionments corresponding to the two fishing seasons specified in § 679.23(d)(2) as follows: A Season, 50 percent; and B Season, 50 percent. Within any fishing year, underharvest or overharvest of a seasonal apportionment may be added to or subtracted from remaining seasonal apportionments in a manner to be determined by the Regional Administrator, provided that any revised seasonal apportionment does not exceed 20 percent of the seasonal TAC apportionment for the statistical area. The reapportionment of underharvest will be applied to the subsequent season within the same statistical area up to the 20 percent limit specified in this paragraph. Any underharvest remaining beyond the 20 percent limit may be further apportioned to the subsequent season in the other statistical areas, in proportion to estimated biomass and in an amount no more than 20 percent of the seasonal TAC apportionment for the statistical area.

      (6) —(i)  The apportionment of pollock in all GOA regulatory areas for each seasonal allowance described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section will be allocated entirely to vessels harvesting pollock for processing by the inshore component in the GOA after subtraction of an amount that is projected by the Regional Administrator to be caught by, or delivered to, the offshore component in the GOA incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species.

      (ii)  The apportionment of Pacific cod in the Eastern GOA Regulatory Area will be allocated 90 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component.

      (7) —(i)  (A) A total of 10.7 percent of the annual Pacific cod TAC will be allocated to the CDQ Program in the annual harvest specifications required under paragraph (c) of this section. The Pacific cod CDQ allocation will be deducted from the annual Pacific cod TAC before allocations to the non-CDQ sectors are made under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.

This amount will be the incidental catch allowance and will be deducted from the aggregate portion of Pacific cod TAC annually allocated to the hook-and-line and pot gear sectors before the allocations under paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section are made to these sectors.

      (iii)  If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a non-CDQ sector will be unable to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod allocated to that sector under paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, the Regional Administrator will reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to other sectors through notification in the  Any reallocation decision by the Regional Administrator will take into account the capability of a sector to harvest the reallocated amount of Pacific cod, and the following reallocation hierarchy:

      (A)  The Regional Administrator will reallocate projected unharvested amounts of Pacific cod TAC from a catcher vessel sector as follows: first to the jig sector, or to the less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or pot catcher vessel sector, or to both of these sectors; second, to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sectors; and third to the trawl catcher vessel sector. If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from the jig sector allocation, the less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or pot catcher vessel sector allocation, or the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the hook-and-line catcher/processor sector. If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from a greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the pot catcher/processor sector in accordance with the hierarchy set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(C) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from a trawl catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the other trawl sectors in accordance with the hierarchy set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(B) of this section.

      (B)  The Regional Administrator will reallocate any projected unharvested amounts of Pacific cod TAC from the trawl catcher vessel or AFA catcher/processor sectors to other trawl sectors before unharvested amounts are reallocated and apportioned to specified gear sectors as follows:

      () 83._1_ percent to the hook-and-line catcher/processor sector,

      () _2_.6 percent to the pot catcher/processor sector, and

      () 14._3_ percent to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector.

      (C)  The Regional Administrator will reallocate any projected unharvested amounts of Pacific cod TAC from the pot catcher/processor sector to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector, and from the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector to the pot catcher/processor sector before reallocating it to the hook-and-line catcher/processor sector.

      (iv) —(A)  The BSAI Pacific cod sector allowances are apportioned by season, as those seasons are specified at § 679.23(e)(5), as follows:

      (B)  Any unused portion of a seasonal allowance of Pacific cod from any sector except the jig sector will be reallocated to that sector's next season during the current fishing year unless the Regional Administrator makes a determination under paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section that the sector will be unable to harvest its allocation.

      (C)  The Regional Administrator will reallocate any projected unused portion of a seasonal allowance of Pacific cod for the jig sector under this section to the less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or pot catcher vessel sector. The Regional Administrator will reallocate the projected unused portion of the jig sector's C season allowance on or about September 1 of each year.

      (v)  A percentage of the Pacific cod TAC, after subtraction of the CDQ reserve, will be allocated as ITAC to the Amendment 80 sector as described in Table 33 to this part. Separate allocations for each Amendment 80 cooperative and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery are described under § 679.9_1_. The allocation of Pacific cod to the Amendment 80 sector will be further divided into seasonal apportionments as described under paragraph (a)(7)(iv)(A)()() of this section.

      () Pacific cod ITAC assigned for harvest by the Amendment 80 limited access fishery in the C season may not be harvested in the A or B seasons.

      (vi)  If during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a portion of the Pacific cod TAC is unlikely to be harvested and is made available for reallocation to the Amendment 80 sector according to the provisions under paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, the Regional Administrator may issue inseason notification in the  that reallocates that remaining amount of Pacific cod to Amendment 80 cooperatives, according to the procedures established under § 679.91(f).

      (vii)  During the annual harvest specifications process, the Regional Administrator will establish an Area 543 Pacific cod harvest limit based on Pacific cod abundance in Area 543 as determined by the annual stock assessment process. NMFS will first subtract the State GHL Pacific cod amount from the AI Pacific cod ABC. Then NMFS will determine the harvest limit in Area 543 by multiplying the percentage of Pacific cod estimated in Area 543 by the remaining ABC for AI Pacific cod.

      (viii)  During the annual harvest specifications process, the Regional Administrator will establish the PCTC Program Aleutian Islands CQ set-aside through the process set forth at § 679.132.

      (8) —(i)  Vessels using jig gear will be allocated up to 2 percent of the TAC of Atka mackerel specified for the Eastern Aleutian Islands District and Bering Sea subarea, after subtraction of reserves, based on the following criteria:

      () L_i_mited to no more than 60 percent of the annual TACs in Areas 542 and 543; and

      () Equally divided between the A and B seasons as defined at § 679.23(e)(3).

      () The annual TAC in Area 543 will be no more than 65 percent of the ABC in Area 543.

      (D) Any unharvested Atka mackerel A season allowance that is added to the B season is prohibited from being harvested within waters 0 nm to 20 nm of Steller sea lion sites listed in Table 6 to this part and located in Areas 541, 542, and 543.

      (iii) [Reserved]

      (iv)  The allocation of Atka mackerel ITAC to the Amendment 80 sector is established in Table 33 to this part. The allocation of Atka mackerel ITAC to the Amendment 80 sector will be further divided into seasonal apportionments under § 679.23(e)(3), and separate allocations for each Amendment 80 cooperative and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery as described under § 679.91.

      (A)  () The amount of Atka mackerel listed on a CQ permit that is assigned for use in the A season may be used in the B season.

      () The amount of Atka mackerel listed on a CQ permit that is assigned for use in the B season may not be used in the A season.

      (B)  () Atka mackerel ITAC assigned for harvest by the Amendment 80 limited access fishery in the A season may be harvested in the B season.

      () Atka mackerel ITAC assigned for harvest by the Amendment 80 limited access fishery in the B season may not be harvested in the A season.

      (v) —(A)  The amount of Atka mackerel ITAC assigned as a directed fishing allowance to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is established in Table 33 to this part.

      (B) — A portion of the annual Pacific cod TAC will be allocated to vessels with an FFP that use jig gear, as determined in the annual harvest specification under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, before TAC is apportioned among other non-jig sectors. Other Pacific cod sector allowances are apportioned after allocation to the jig sector based on gear type, operation type, and length overall as follows:

      (ii) —(A) The Regional Administrator may apply any underage or overage of Pacific cod harvest by each sector from one season to the subsequent season. In adding or subtracting any underages or overages to the subsequent season, the Regional Administrator shall consider the incidental catch and any catch in the directed fishery by each sector.

      (B) If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a sector will be unable to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod allocated to that sector under (a)(12)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the Regional Administrator will reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to other sectors through notification in the  Any reallocation decision by the Regional Administrator would consider a reallocation of the projected unused allocation to the CV sectors first, then to the combined CV and C/P pot sector, and then to all other C/P sectors, taking into account the capability of a sector, as determined by the NMFS Alaska Regional Administrator, to harvest the remaining Pacific cod TAC.

      (iii) —(A) Incidental Pacific cod harvested between the closure of the A season and opening of the B season shall be deducted from the B season TAC apportionment for that sector.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  Fifteen percent of the _BSAI_ TAC for each target species, except pollock, the fixed gear allocation for sablefish, and the Amendment 80 species, which includes Pacific cod, is automatically placed in the nonspecified reserve before allocation to any sector. The remaining 85 percent of each TAC is apportioned to the initial TAC for each target species that contributed to the nonspecified reserve. The nonspecified reserve is not designated by species or species group. Any amount of the nonspecified reserve may be apportioned to target species that contributed to the nonspecified reserve, provided that such apportionments are consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section and do not result in overfishing of a target species.

      (ii) —(A) —()  In the annual harvest specifications required by paragraph (c) of this section, _1_0 percent of the Bering Sea subarea pollock TAC will be allocated to a CDQ reserve as a directed fishing allowance.

If the Aleutian Islands subarea and/or Bogoslof District is closed to directed fishing for pollock by regulation, then no pollock CDQ reserve will be established for those areas and incidental harvest of pollock by CDQ groups will accrue against the incidental catch allowance for pollock established under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A)() of this section.

      (B)  Twenty percent of the fixed gear allocation of sablefish established under paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) and (a)(4)(iv)(A) of this section will be allocated to a CDQ reserve for each subarea.

      (C)  An amount equal to 10.7 percent of the BSAI TACs for Atka mackerel, Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch, yellowfin sole, rock sole, flathead sole, and Pacific cod will be allocated to a CDQ reserve for each of these species by management area, subarea, or district.

      (D)  () An amount equal to _1_0.7 percent of the BSAI TACs for Bering Sea Greenland turbot and arrowtooth flounder, and 7.5 percent of the trawl gear allocation of sablefish in the BS and AI is apportioned from the nonspecified reserve established under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to a CDQ reserve for each of these species by management area, subarea, or district.

      () For all other groundfish species not specifically listed in paragraphs (b)(_1_)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(D)() of this section, an amount equal to 10.7 percent of the BSAI TAC will be apportioned to a CDQ reserve if NMFS, after consultation with the Council and in consideration of public comment, determines in the annual harvest specifications process under paragraph (c) of this section that a directed fishery in the BSAI exists for this species under section 305(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. In making this determination, the Council and NMFS shall consider whether sufficient TAC exists to open a directed fishery for that species in the BSAI and that this species or species group is economically viable for the CDQ group to target.

      (iii)  (A) ABC reserves are annually established for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole. For each flatfish species, the ABC reserve is calculated as an amount less than or equal to the ABC surplus. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may set the ABC reserve for flathead sole, rock sole, or yellowfin sole below the ABC surplus for that species based on social, economic, or ecological considerations.

      (B)  An amount equal to 10.7 percent of the ABC reserves for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole will be allocated to a CDQ ABC reserve. The CDQ ABC reserves will be:

      () Calculated during the annual harvest specifications described at paragraph (c) of this section, as allocations to CDQ groups; and

      () Allocated to each CDQ group as described under § 679.31(b)(4).

      (C)  Amendment 80 ABC reserves shall be calculated as the ABC reserves described under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section as reduced by the CDQ ABC reserves under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section. The Amendment 80 ABC reserves will be:

      () Calculated during the annual harvest specifications described at paragraph (c) of this section, as allocations to Amendment 80 cooperatives; and

      () Allocated to each Amendment 80 cooperative as described under § 679.91(i)(_2_).

      (2)  Initial reserves are established for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish, octopuses, and sharks, which are equal to 20 percent of the TACs for these species or species groups.

      (i)  Any amounts of the GOA reserve that are reapportioned to pollock as provided by paragraph (b) of this section must be apportioned for processing by the inshore component in the GOA and the offshore component in the GOA in the same proportions specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.

      (ii)  Any amounts of the GOA reserve that are reapportioned to the GOA Pacific cod fishery as provided by paragraph (b) of this section must be apportioned in the same proportion specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(12)(i) of this section.

      (3) —(i)  (A) As soon as practicable after April 1, June 1, and August 1, and on such other dates as NMFS determines appropriate, NMFS will, by notification in the  apportion all or part of the BSAI or GOA reserve in accordance with this paragraph (b).

      (B) No apportionment, retention, or PSC limit adjustment may take effect until notification has been published in the  with a statement of the findings upon which the apportionment, retention, or adjustment is based.

      (ii) —(A)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, NMFS will apportion the amount of BSAI or GOA reserve that will be harvested by U.S. vessels during the remainder of the year.

      (B)  Part or all of the BSAI or GOA reserve may be withheld if an apportionment would adversely affect the conservation of groundfish resources or prohibited species.

      (iii) —(A)  NMFS will provide all interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed apportionments, retentions, or PSC limit adjustments under this paragraph (b) before such apportionments, retentions, or adjustments are made, unless NMFS finds that there is good cause for not providing a prior comment opportunity, and publishes the reasons therefor in the notification of apportionment, retention, or adjustment.

      (B)  Comments provided for in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) must be received by NMFS not later than 5 days before April 1, June 1, and August 1, or other dates that may be specified.

      (C)  If NMFS determines for good cause that notification of apportionment, retention or PSC limit adjustment must be issued without providing interested persons a prior opportunity for public comment, comments on the apportionment, retention or adjustment will be received for a period of 15 days after its effective date.

      (D)  NMFS will consider all timely comments in deciding whether to make a proposed apportionment, retention, or PSC limit adjustment or to modify an apportionment, retention, or adjustment that previously has been made, and shall publish responses to those comments in the  as soon as practicable.

      (E)  The Regional Administrator will make available to the public during business hours the aggregate data upon which any preliminary TAC or PSC limit figure is based or the data upon which any apportionment or retention of surplus or reserve, or PSC limit adjustment was or is proposed to be based. These data will be available for a sufficient period to facilitate informed comment by interested persons.

      (c) —(1) —(i)  As soon as practicable after consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish proposed specifications for the groundfish fisheries in the BSAI and the GOA.

      (ii)  NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed specifications established by this section and by § 679.21 for a period specified in the notice of proposed specifications published in the

      (d) —(1) —(i)  If the Regional Administrator determines that any allocation or apportionment of a target species specified under paragraph (c) of this section has been or will be reached, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species or species group.

      (ii) —(A)  The category allocations or apportionments established under paragraph (c) of this section may be revised by inseason adjustments, as defined at § 679.25, for a given species or species group or pollock allowance, as identified by regulatory area, subarea, or district, and, if applicable, as further identified by gear type.

      (B)  In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the Regional Administrator shall consider the amount of the allocation or apportionment established under paragraph (c) of this section that will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the same subarea, regulatory area, or district.

      (iii) —(A)  If the Regional Administrator establishes a directed fishing allowance for a fishery allocation or apportionment under this paragraph (d), and that allowance has been or will be reached before the end of the fishing season or year, NMFS will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing in the specified subarea, regulatory area, or district.

      (B)  Except as described in § 679.20(e)(3)(iii) and § 679.20(j), if directed fishing for a target species or species group is prohibited, a vessel may not retain that incidental species in an amount that exceeds the maximum retainable amount, as calculated under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, at any time during a fishing trip.

      (iv) —(A) If the Regional Administrator determines that any sideboard harvest limit for a group of AFA vessels established under § 679.64 has been or will be reached, the Regional Administrator may establish a sideboard directed fishing allowance for the species or species group applicable only to the identified group of AFA vessels.

      (B) In establishing a directed fishing allowance under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the Regional Administrator will consider the amount of the sideboard limit established for a group of AFA vessels under § 679.64 that will be taken as incidental catch by those vessels in directed fishing for other species.

      (C) If the Regional Administrator determines that a sideboard amount is insufficient to support a directed fishery for that species then the Regional Administrator may set the sideboard directed fishing allowance at zero for that species or species group.

      (D) Species or species groups for which directed fishing for sideboard limits by AFA vessels is prohibited are listed in Tables 54, 55, and 56 to this part.

      (v)  (A) If the Regional Administrator determines that a GOA sideboard limit for a GOA groundfish species as described under Table 37 to this part is sufficient to support a directed fishing allowance for that species, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance for the species applicable only to Amendment 80 vessels subject to the GOA groundfish sideboard limit.

      (B) If the Regional Administrator determines that a GOA groundfish sideboard limit as described under Table 37 to this part is insufficient to support a directed fishing allowance by Amendment 80 vessels for that species, then the Regional Administrator may set the directed fishing allowance to zero for that species for Amendment 80 vessels.

      (C) Upon determining that a GOA sideboard limit as described under Table 37 to this part for a species is or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for that species by the Amendment 80 vessels to which the GOA sideboard limit applies.

      (vi)  (A) If the Regional Administrator determines that a GOA sideboard limit for halibut PSC is sufficient to support a directed fishery for a species or species group, management area, and season specified in Table 38 to this part, then the Regional Administrator may establish a halibut PSC sideboard limit for that species or species group, management area, and season applicable to the Amendment 80 vessels to which the halibut PSC limit applies.

      (B) If the Regional Administrator determines that a halibut PSC sideboard limit is insufficient to support a directed fishery for a species or species group, management area, and season as specified in Table 38 to this part then the Regional Administrator may set the halibut PSC sideboard limit for that species or species group to zero for the Amendment 80 vessels to which the halibut PSC limit applies.

      (C) Upon determining that a halibut PSC sideboard limit for a species or species group, management area, and season as specified in Table 38 to this part is or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for a specific species or species group by the Amendment 80 vessels to which the halibut PSC limit applies as follows:

      () If the halibut PSC sideboard limit is reached for the deep-water species fishery as defined in § 679.2_1_(d)(3)(iii)(B) for a season, then NMFS will close directed fishing in the GOA for all species in the deep-water species fishery except northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and dusky rockfish in the Central GOA for that season.

      () If the halibut PSC sideboard limit is reached for the shallow-water species fishery as defined in § 679._2_1(d)(3)(iii)(A) for a season, then NMFS will close directed fishing in the GOA for all species in the shallow-water species fishery for that season.

      (2)  When the Regional Administrator determines that the TAC of any target species specified under paragraph (c) of this section, or the share of any TAC assigned to any type of gear, has been or will be achieved prior to the end of a year, NMFS will publish notification in the  requiring that target species be treated in the same manner as a prohibited species, as described under § 679.21(a), for the remainder of the year, except:

      (i) Rockfish species caught by catcher vessels using hook-and-line, pot, or jig gear as described in paragraph (j) of this section; and

      (ii) Catcher vessels in the trawl EM category.

      (3) —(i)  If, in making a determination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Regional Administrator also determines that fishing for other target species or species groups in the area, district or part thereof where the notification applies, may lead to the overfishing of the species or species group for which the allocation or apportionment has been or will be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the  specifying limitations or prohibitions designed to prevent overfishing of that species or species group.

      (ii)  These limitations and prohibitions may prohibit directed fishing for other species or species groups in the area, district, or part thereof where the notification applies, or may limit time, area, or gear types that may be used in directed fishing for the other species or species groups.

      (iii)  When making the determinations specified under paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section, the Regional Administrator may consider allowing fishing to continue or resume with certain gear types or in certain areas and times based on findings of:

      (A) The risk of biological harm to a groundfish species or species group for which the TAC or PSC limit is or will be reached.

      (B) The risk of socioeconomic harm to authorized users of the groundfish for which the TAC or PSC limit will be or has been reached.

      (C) The impact that the continued closure might have on the socioeconomic well-being of other domestic fisheries.

      (4)  If a biological assessment of stock condition for pollock, Pacific cod, or Atka mackerel within an area projects that the spawning biomass in that area will be equal to or below 20 percent of the projected unfished spawning biomass during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator will prohibit the directed fishery for the relevant species within the area. The Regional Administrator will prohibit the directed fishery under this paragraph by notification published in the  The directed fishery will remain closed until a subsequent biological assessment projects that the spawning biomass for the species in the area will exceed 20 percent of the projected unfished spawning biomass during a fishing year.

      (e) —(1)  The maximum retainable amount of an incidental catch species is calculated as a proportion of the basis species retained on board the vessel using:

      (i) The retainable percentages in Table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories (except the Rockfish Program fisheries, which are described in Table 30 to this part for the Rockfish Program fisheries); and

      (ii) Table 11 to this part for the BSAI species categories.

      (2)  (i) To calculate the maximum retainable amount for a specific incidental catch species, an individual retainable amount must be calculated with respect to each basis species that is retained on board that vessel.

      (ii) To obtain these individual retainable amounts, multiply the appropriate retainable percentage for the incidental catch species/basis species combination, set forth in Table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories (except the Rockfish Program fisheries, which are described in Table 30 to this part for the Rockfish Program fisheries), and Table 11 to this part for the BSAI species categories, by the amount of that basis species, in round-weight equivalents.

      (iii) The maximum retainable amount for that specific incidental catch species is the sum of the individual retainable amount.

      (3)  (i) For catcher vessels, the maximum retainable amount for vessels fishing during a fishing trip in areas closed to directed fishing is the lowest maximum retainable amount applicable in any area, and this maximum retainable amount must be applied at any time and to all areas for the duration of the fishing trip.

      (ii) For catcher/processors fishing in an area closed to directed fishing for a species or species group, the maximum retainable amount for that species or species group applies at any time for the duration of the fishing trip.

      (iii) For all vessels not listed in subpart F of this section, the maximum retainable amount for pollock harvested in the BSAI is calculated at the end of each offload and is based on the basis species harvested since the previous offload. For purposes of this paragraph, offload means the removal of any fish or fish product from the vessel that harvested the fish or fish product to any other vessel or to shore.

      (iv) The maximum retainable amount for groundfish harvested in the Central GOA by a catcher/processor vessel fishing under a rockfish CQ permit is calculated at the end of each weekly reporting period, and is based on the basis species defined in Table 30 harvested since the previous weekly reporting period, or for any portion of a weekly reporting period that vessel was designated under a vessel check-in as specified in § 679.5(r)(8).

      (v) For all vessels not listed in subpart F of this section, the maximum retainable amount for Atka mackerel harvested in the Bering Sea subarea is calculated at the end of each offload and is based on the basis species harvested since the previous offload. For purposes of this paragraph, offload means the removal of any fish or fish product from the vessel that harvested the fish or fish product to any other vessel or to shore.

      (vi) For a catcher/processor with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement that receives an unsorted codend delivered by a catcher vessel authorized to harvest and that is assigned to PCTC Program Pacific cod, the maximum retainable amount for each species or species group applies at any time for the duration of the fishing trip and must be applied to only the PCTC Program hauls during a fishing trip.

      (f) —(1)  Any determination concerning directed fishing, the amount or percentage of any species, species group, or any fish or fish products must be calculated in round-weight equivalents.

      (2)  Any groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed may not be used to calculate retainable amounts of other groundfish species. Only fish harvested under the CDQ Program may be used to calculate retainable amounts of other CDQ species.

      (g) —(1)  (i) Pollock roe retained on board a vessel at any time during a fishing trip must not exceed the following percentages of the total round-weight equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product on board the vessel during the same fishing trip:

      (A) 7 percent in the Gulf of Alaska, and

      (B) 9 percent in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.

      (ii) Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be based on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a single fishing trip.

      (iii) Pollock or pollock products from previous fishing trips that are retained on board a vessel may not be used to determine the allowable retention of pollock roe for that vessel.

      (2)  (i) For purposes of this paragraph (g), only one primary pollock product per fish, other than roe, may be used to calculate the round-weight equivalent.

      (ii) A primary pollock product that contains roe (such as headed and gutted pollock with roe) may not be used to calculate the round-weight equivalent of pollock.

      (iii) The primary pollock product must be distinguished from ancillary pollock products in eLandings required under § 679.5(e)(9)(i)(D) and § 679.5(e)(10)(iii)(H) (see also Table 1c to this part).

      (3)  Use the product types and standard PRRs for pollock found in Table 3 to this part to calculate round-weight equivalents for pollock for purposes of this paragraph (g).

      (4) —(i)  (A) To calculate the amount of pollock roe that can be retained on board during a fishing trip, first calculate the round-weight equivalent by dividing the total amount of primary product on board by the appropriate PRR.

      (B) To determine the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained on board a vessel during the same fishing trip, multiply the round-weight equivalent by 0.07 in the Gulf of Alaska or 0.09 in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.

      (C) Pollock roe retained on board from previous fishing trips will not be counted.

      (ii)  (A) If two or more products, other than roe, are made from different fish, round-weight equivalents are calculated separately for each product.

      (B) To determine the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained on board a vessel during a fishing trip, add the round-weight equivalents together; then, multiply the sum by 0.07 in the Gulf of Alaska or 0.09 in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.

      (iii)  If two or more products, other than roe, are made from the same fish, the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained during a fishing trip is determined from the primary product.

      (5) —(i)  Any primary pollock product used to calculate retainable amounts of pollock roe must be frozen, canned, or reduced to meal by the vessel retaining the pollock roe prior to any transfer of the product to another vessel.

      (ii)  Any pollock product that has been processed may not be discarded at sea unless such discarding is necessary to meet other requirements of this part.

      (h) —(1)  Round-weight equivalents for groundfish products are calculated using the product codes and standard PRRs specified in Table 3 to this part.

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may adjust standard PRRs and product types specified in Table 3 to this part if he or she determines that existing standard PRRs are inaccurate or if new product types are developed.

      (i) Adjustments to any standard PRR listed in Table 3 to this part that are within and including 15 percent of that standard PRR may be made without providing notification and opportunity for prior public comment.

      (ii) Adjustments of any standard PRR during a calendar year, when aggregated with all other adjustments made during that year, will not exceed 15 percent of the standard PRR listed in Table 3 to this part at the beginning of that calendar year.

      (iii) No new product type will be announced until NMFS publishes the proposed adjustment and/or new product type in the  and provides the public with at least 30 days opportunity for public comment.

      (iv) Any adjustment of a PRR that acts to further restrict the fishery will not be effective until 30 days after the date of publication in the

      (v) If NMFS makes any adjustment or announcement without providing a prior notification and opportunity for prior public comment, the Regional Administrator will receive public comments on the adjustment or announcement for a period of 15 days from the date of publication in the

      (i) —(1)  See Table 2c to this part.

      (2)  The provisions of this paragraph (i) apply to all vessels fishing for groundfish in the BSAI or GOA, and to all vessels processing groundfish harvested in the BSAI or GOA.

      (3)  Directed fishing for forage fish, grenadiers, squids, and sculpins is prohibited at all times in the BSAI and GOA.

      (4)  The sale, barter, trade, or processing of forage fish and grenadiers is prohibited, except as provided in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.

      (5)  Retained catch of forage fish or grenadiers not exceeding the maximum retainable amount may be processed into fishmeal for sale, barter, or trade.

      (6)  Retained catch of squids and sculpins not exceeding the maximum retainable amount may be sold to a processor or processed into any product form, including (but not limited to) fishmeal, bait, and whole fish/food fish, for sale, barter, or trade.

      (j)—(1)  The operator of a catcher vessel that is required to have a Federal fisheries permit using hook-and-line, pot, or jig gear, must retain and land all rockfish that is caught while fishing for groundfish or IFQ or CDQ halibut in the BSAI or GOA.

      (2)  Except as described in §§ 679.20(j)(3) and (4), when rockfish is closed to directed fishing, the operator of a catcher vessel that is required to have a Federal fisheries permit under § 679.4(b), or the manager of a shoreside processor that is required to have a Federal processor permit under § 679.4(f), must dispose of rockfish retained and landed in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section as follows:

      (i) A person may sell, barter, or trade a round weight equivalent amount of rockfish that is less than or equal to 15 percent of the aggregate round weight equivalent of IFQ halibut and groundfish species, other than rockfish, that are landed during the same fishing trip.

      (ii) A person may sell, barter, or trade a round weight equivalent amount of yelloweye rockfish that is less than or equal to 5 percent of the aggregate round weight equivalent of IFQ halibut and groundfish species, other than rockfish, that are landed during the same fishing trip. The aggregate amount of all rockfish species sold, bartered, or traded cannot exceed the MCA established under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

      (iii) Amounts of rockfish retained by catcher vessels under paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section that are in excess of the limits specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section may be put to any use, including but not limited to personal consumption or donation, but must not enter commerce through sale, barter, or trade except as fish meal.

      (3)  When DSR is closed to directed fishing in the SEO, the operator of a catcher vessel that is required to have a Federal fisheries permit under § 679.4(b), or the manager of a shoreside processor that is required to have a Federal processor permit under § 679.4(f), must dispose of DSR retained and landed in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section as follows:

      (i) A person may sell, barter, or trade a round weight equivalent amount of DSR that is less than or equal to 10 percent of the aggregate round weight equivalent of IFQ halibut and groundfish species, other than sablefish, that are landed during the same fishing trip. The aggregate amount of all rockfish species sold, bartered, or traded cannot exceed the MCA established under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

      (ii) A person may sell, barter, or trade a round weight equivalent amount of DSR that is less than or equal to 1 percent of the aggregate round weight equivalent of IFQ sablefish that are landed during the same fishing trip.

      § 679.21   Prohibited species bycatch management.

#### § § 679.21

      (a)  (1) See § 679.2 and Table 2b to this part for definition of prohibited species.

      (2)  The operator of each vessel engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI must:

      (i) Minimize its catch of prohibited species.

      (ii) After allowing for sampling by an observer, if an observer is aboard, sort its catch immediately after retrieval of the gear and, except for salmon prohibited species catch in the BS pollock fisheries and GOA groundfish fisheries under paragraph (f) or (h) of this section, or any prohibited species catch as provided (in permits issued) under the PSD program at § 679.26, return all prohibited species, or parts thereof, to the sea immediately, with a minimum of injury, regardless of its condition.

      (A) Vessels in the trawl EM category must retain all prohibited species catch for sampling by an observer.

      (B) [Reserved]

      (3)  Except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section and § 679.26, there will be a rebuttable presumption that any prohibited species retained on board a fishing vessel regulated under this part was caught and retained in violation of this section.

      (4)  No vessel fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI may have on board any species listed in this paragraph (a) that was taken in waters seaward of these management areas, regardless of whether retention of such species was authorized by other applicable laws.

      (5)  (See § 679.24(c) for gear restrictions for sablefish.)

      (6)  Unless otherwise specified, submit information required under this section to NMFS as follows: by mail to the Regional Administrator, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802; by courier to the Office of the Regional Administrator, 709 West 9th St., Juneau, AK 99801; or by fax to 907-586-7465. Forms are available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site ().

      (b) —(1)  Subject to the provisions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, the following three _BSAI halibut PSC limits_ are established, which total 1,770 mt: BSAI trawl limited access sector—745 mt; BSAI non-trawl sector—710 mt; and CDQ Program—315 mt (established as a PSQ reserve). An additional amount of BSAI halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 sector will be determined for each calendar year according to the procedure in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

      (i)  The PSC limit of halibut caught while conducting any fishery in the Amendment 80 sector is an amount of halibut equivalent to 1,745 mt of halibut mortality. Halibut PSC limits within the Amendment 80 sector will be established for Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery according to the procedure and formulae in § 679.91(d) and (f). If halibut PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery, it will be apportioned into PSC allowances for trawl fishery categories according to the procedure in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A)() and () of this section.

      (A)  The Amendment 80 sector BSAI halibut PSC limit applies to Amendment 80 vessels while conducting any fishery in the BSAI and is an amount of halibut determined annually according to the procedure in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (B)  By October 1 of each year, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center will provide the Regional Administrator an estimate of halibut biomass derived from the most recent Alaska Fisheries Science Center Eastern Bering Sea shelf trawl survey index. Each year, NMFS will request that the International Pacific Halibut Commission provide to the Regional Administrator, by December 1 of that year, an estimate of halibut biomass derived from the most recent International Pacific Halibut Commission setline survey index. NMFS will apply both halibut biomass estimates to table 58 to this part, such that the value at the intercept of those survey indices in table 58 is the Amendment 80 sector halibut PSC limit for the following calendar year. NMFS will publish the new Amendment 80 sector halibut PSC limit in the annual harvest specifications.

      (C)  For Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery, BSAI halibut PSC limits will be allocated according to the procedures and formulas in § 679.91(d) and (f) (not paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section). If halibut PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery, it will be apportioned into PSC allowances for trawl fishery categories according to the procedure in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A)() and () of this section.

      (ii) —(A)  () The PSC limit of halibut caught while conducting any fishery in the _BSAI trawl limited access sector_ is an amount of halibut equivalent to 745 mt of halibut mortality.

      () NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will apportion the PSC limit set forth under paragraph (b)(__1__)(ii)(A)() of this section into PSC allowances for the trawl fishery categories defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B)() through () of this section.

      () Apportionment of the trawl halibut PSC limit set forth under paragraph (b)(_1_)(ii)(A)() of this section among the trawl fishery categories will be based on each category's proportional share of the anticipated halibut PSC during a fishing year and the need to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvested under the halibut PSC limit for this sector.

      () The sum of all PSC allowances for this sector will equal the PSC limit set forth under paragraph (b)(_1_)(ii)(A)() of this section.

      (B)  For purposes of apportioning the trawl PSC limit set forth under paragraph (b)(_1_)(ii)(A)() of this section among trawl fisheries, the following fishery categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight equivalents of those groundfish species or species groups for which a TAC has been specified under § 679.20.

      ()  Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a catch of pollock that is 95 percent or more of the total amount of groundfish caught during the week.

      ()  Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of rock sole, “other flatfish,” and yellowfin sole that is greater than the retained amount of any other fishery category defined under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B).

      ()  F_i_shing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that is defined as a flatfish fishery under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)() and results in a retained amount of yellowfin sole that is 70 percent or more of the retained aggregate amount of rock sole, “other flatfish,” and yellowfin sole.

      ()  F_i_shing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that is defined as a flatfish fishery under this paragraph (b)(1)(_ii_)(B)() and is not a yellowfin sole fishery as defined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)()() of this section.

      (f) —(1)  This paragraph contains regulations governing the bycatch of salmon in the BS pollock fishery.

      (2)  Each year, NMFS will allocate to AFA sectors listed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section a portion of the applicable Chinook salmon PSC limit. NMFS will publish the applicable Chinook salmon PSC limit in the annual harvest specifications after determining if it is a low Chinook salmon abundance year. NMFS will determine that it is a low Chinook salmon abundance year when abundance of Chinook salmon in western Alaska is less than or equal to 250,000 Chinook salmon. By October 1 of each year, the State of Alaska will provide to NMFS an estimate of Chinook salmon abundance using the 3-System Index for western Alaska based on the Kuskokwim, Unalakleet, and Upper Yukon aggregate stock grouping.

      (i) An AFA sector will receive a portion of the 47,591 Chinook salmon PSC limit, or, in a low Chinook salmon abundance year, the 33,318 Chinook salmon PSC limit, if —

      (A) No Chinook salmon bycatch incentive plan agreement (IPA) is approved by NMFS under paragraph (f)(12) of this section; or

      (B) That AFA sector has exceeded its performance standard under paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

      (ii) An AFA sector will receive a portion of the 60,000 Chinook salmon PSC limit, or, in a low Chinook salmon abundance year, the 45,000 Chinook salmon PSC limit, if—

      (A) At least one IPA is approved by NMFS under paragraph (f)(12) of this section; and

      (B) That AFA sector has not exceeded its performance standard under paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

      (3) —(i)  NMFS will apportion the Chinook salmon PSC limits annually 70 percent to the A season and 30 percent to the B season, which are described in § 679.23(e)(2).

      (ii)  Each year, NMFS will make allocations of the applicable Chinook salmon PSC limit to the following four AFA sectors:

      (iii)  NMFS will allocate the Chinook salmon PSC limits to each AFA sector as follows:

      (A) If a sector is managed under the 60,000 Chinook salmon PSC limit, the maximum amount of Chinook salmon PSC allocated to each sector in each season and annually is—

      (B) If the sector is managed under the 45,000 Chinook salmon PSC limit, the sector will be allocated the following amount of Chinook salmon PSC in each season and annually:

      (C) If the sector is managed under the 47,591 Chinook salmon PSC limit, the sector will be allocated the following amount of Chinook salmon PSC in each season and annually:

      (D) If the sector is managed under the 33,318 Chinook salmon PSC limit, the sector will be allocated the following amount of Chinook salmon PSC in each season and annually:

      (iv)  (A) NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section to entities representing the AFA catcher/processor sector and the AFA mothership sector if these sectors meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(8) of this section.

      (B) If no entity is approved by NMFS to represent the AFA catcher/processor sector or the AFA mothership sector, then NMFS will manage that sector under a non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocation under paragraph (f)(10) of this section.

      (v)  NMFS will further allocate the inshore sector's Chinook salmon PSC allocation under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section among the inshore cooperatives and the inshore open access fishery based on the percentage allocations of pollock to each inshore cooperative under § 679.62(a). NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to inshore cooperatives. Any Chinook salmon PSC allocated to the inshore open access fishery will be as a non-transferable allocation managed by NMFS under the requirements of paragraph (f)(10) of this section.

      (vi)  NMFS will further allocate the Chinook salmon PSC allocation to the CDQ Program under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section among the six CDQ groups based on each CDQ group's percentage of the CDQ Program pollock allocation. NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to CDQ groups.

      (vii)

      (viii)  For each year, NMFS will release to the public and publish on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site ():

      (A) The Chinook salmon PSC allocations for each entity receiving a transferable allocation;

      (B) The non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations;

      (C) The vessels fishing under each transferable or non-transferable allocation;

      (D) The amount of Chinook salmon bycatch that accrues towards each transferable or non-transferable allocation;

      (E) Any changes to these allocations due to transfers under paragraph (f)(9) of this section, rollovers under paragraph (f)(11) of this section, and deductions from the B season non-transferable allocations under paragraphs (f)(5)(v) or (f)(10)(iii) of this section; and

      (F) Tables for each sector that provide the percent of the sector's pollock allocation, numbers of Chinook salmon associated with each vessel in the sector used to calculate the opt-out allocation and annual threshold amounts, and the percent of the pollock allocation associated with each vessel that NMFS will use to calculate IPA minimum participation assigned to each vessel.

      (4) —(i)  NMFS will reduce the seasonal allocation of the Chinook salmon PSC limit to the catcher/processor sector, the mothership sector, the inshore sector, or the CDQ Program under paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, if the owner of any permitted AFA vessel in that sector, or any CDQ group, does not participate in an approved IPA under paragraph (f)(12) of this section. NMFS will subtract the amount of Chinook salmon from each sector's allocation associated with each vessel not participating in an approved IPA.

      (ii)  (A) If some members of an inshore cooperative do not participate in an approved IPA, NMFS will reduce the allocation to the cooperative to which those vessels belong, or the inshore open access fishery.

      (B) If all members of an inshore cooperative do not participate in an approved IPA, the amount of Chinook salmon that remains in the inshore sector's allocation, after subtracting the amount of Chinook salmon associated with the non-participating inshore cooperative, will be reallocated among the inshore cooperatives participating in an approved IPA based on the proportion each participating cooperative represents of the Chinook salmon PSC initially allocated among the participating inshore cooperatives that year.

      (iii)  If a CDQ group does not participate in an approved IPA, the amount of Chinook salmon that remains in the CDQ Program's allocation, after subtracting the amount of Chinook salmon associated with the non-participating CDQ group, will be reallocated among the CDQ groups participating in an approved IPA based on the proportion each participating CDQ group represents of the Chinook salmon PSC initially allocated among the participating CDQ groups that year.

      (iv)  If all members of a sector do not participate in an approved IPA, the amount of Chinook salmon that remains after subtracting the amount of Chinook salmon associated with the non-participating sector will not be reallocated among the sectors that have members participating in an approved IPA. This portion of the PSC limit will remain unallocated for that year.

      (5)  The following table describes requirements for the opt-out allocation:

      (6)  If the total annual Chinook salmon bycatch by the members of a sector participating in an approved IPA is greater than that sector's annual threshold amount of Chinook salmon in any three of seven consecutive years, that sector will receive an allocation of Chinook salmon under the 47,591 PSC limit in all future years, except in low Chinook salmon abundance years when that sector will receive an allocation under the 33,318 Chinook salmon PSC limit.

      (i)  Prior to each year, NMFS will calculate each sector's annual threshold amount. NMFS will post the annual threshold amount for each sector on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site (). At the end of each year, NMFS will evaluate the Chinook salmon bycatch by all IPA participants in each sector against that sector's annual threshold amount.

      (ii)  A sector's annual threshold amount is the annual number of Chinook salmon that would be allocated to that sector under the 47,591 Chinook salmon PSC limit, as shown in the table in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, or the 33,318 Chinook salmon PSC limit in low Chinook salmon abundance years, as shown in the table in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(D) of this section. If any vessels in a sector do not participate in an approved IPA, NMFS will reduce that sector's annual threshold amount by the number of Chinook salmon associated with each vessel not participating in an approved IPA. If any CDQ groups do not participate in an approved IPA, NMFS will reduce the CDQ Program's annual threshold amount by the number of Chinook salmon associated with each CDQ group not participating in an approved IPA.

      (iii)  If NMFS determines that a sector has exceeded its performance standard by exceeding its annual threshold amount in any three of seven consecutive years, NMFS will issue a notification in the  that the sector has exceeded its performance standard. In all subsequent years, NMFS will allocate to that sector either the amount of Chinook salmon in the table in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section or, in low Chinook salmon abundance years, the amount of Chinook salmon in the table in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(D) of this section. All members of the affected sector will fish under this lower PSC allocation regardless of whether a vessel or CDQ group within that sector participates in an approved IPA.

      (7)  If an AFA-permitted vessel is no longer eligible to participate in the BS pollock fishery or if a vessel replaces a currently eligible vessel, NMFS will assign the portion and number of Chinook salmon associated with that vessel to the replacement vessel or distribute it among other eligible vessels in the sector based on the procedures in the law, regulation, or private contract that accomplishes the vessel removal or replacement action.

      (8)  (i) NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to the following entities, if these entities meet all the applicable requirements of this section.

      (A)  NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to the inshore cooperatives permitted annually under § 679.4(l)(6). The representative and agent for service of process (see definition at § 679.2) for an inshore cooperative is the cooperative representative identified in the application for an inshore cooperative fishing permit issued under § 679.4(l)(6), unless the inshore cooperative representative notifies NMFS in writing that a different person will act as its agent for service of process for purposes of this paragraph (f). An inshore cooperative is not required to submit an application under paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section to receive a transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocation.

      (B)  NMFS will issue transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to the _CDQ groups._ The representative and agent for service of process for a CDQ group is the chief executive officer of the CDQ group, unless the chief executive officer notifies NMFS in writing that a different person will act as its agent for service of process.

      (E) Chinook salmon PSC allocations may not be transferred between seasons.

      (ii)  If the Chinook salmon bycatch by an entity exceeds its seasonal allocation, the entity may receive transfers of Chinook salmon PSC to cover overages for that season. An entity may conduct transfers to cover an overage that results from Chinook salmon bycatch from any fishing trip by a vessel fishing on behalf of that entity that was completed or is in progress at the time the entity's allocation is first exceeded. Under § 679.7(d)(5)(ii)(C)() and (k)(8)(v)(B), vessels fishing on behalf of an entity that has exceeded its Chinook salmon PSC allocation for a season may not start a new fishing trip for pollock in the BS on behalf of that same entity for the remainder of that season.

      (iii) —(A)  NMFS will process a request for transfer of Chinook salmon PSC provided that a paper or electronic application is completed, with all information fields accurately filled in. Application forms are available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site () or from NMFS at the address in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

      (B) —()  The transferor's designated representative must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete. The transferor's designated representative must submit the paper application as indicated on the application.

      ()  The transferor's designated entity representative must log onto the NMFS online services system and create a transfer request as indicated on the computer screen.

      ()  The transferee's designated representative must log onto the NMFS online services system and accept the transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferee's NMFS ID, password, and Transfer Key, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (D)  NMFS will not approve an application for transfer of Chinook salmon PSC after June 25 for the A season or after December 1 for the B season.

      (10)  (i) All vessels belonging to a sector that is ineligible to receive transferable allocations under paragraph (f)(8) of this section, any catcher vessels participating in an inshore open access fishery, and all vessels fishing under the opt-out allocation under paragraph (f)(5) of this section will fish under specific non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations.

      (ii) All vessels fishing under a non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocation, including vessels fishing on behalf of a CDQ group, will be managed together by NMFS under that non-transferable allocation. If, during the fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a seasonal non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocation will be reached, NMFS will publish a notice in the  closing the BS to directed fishing for pollock by those vessels fishing under that non-transferable allocation for the remainder of the season or for the remainder of the year.

      (iii) For each non-transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocation, NMFS will deduct from the B season allocation any amount of Chinook salmon bycatch in the A season that exceeds the amount available under the A season allocation.

      (11) —(i)  NMFS will add any Chinook salmon PSC allocation remaining at the end of the A season, after any transfers under paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section, to an entity's B season allocation.

      (ii)  For a non-transferable allocation for the mothership sector, catcher/processor sector, or an inshore open access fishery, NMFS will add any Chinook salmon PSC remaining in that non-transferable allocation at the end of the A season to that B season non-transferable allocation.

      (12) —(i)  More than one IPA may be approved by NMFS. Each IPA must have participants that represent the following:

      (A)  Parties to an IPA must collectively represent at least 9 percent of the BS pollock quota.

      (B)  Parties to an IPA must represent any combination of two or more CDQ groups or corporations, partnerships, or individuals who own AFA-permitted vessels and are not affiliated, as affiliation is defined for purposes of AFA entities in § 679.2.

      (ii)  (A) No vessel owner or CDQ group is required to join an IPA.

      (B) For a vessel owner in the catcher/processor sector or mothership sector to join an IPA, that vessel owner must be a member of the entity representing that sector under paragraph (f)(8).

      (C) For a CDQ group to be a member of an IPA, the CDQ group must sign the IPA and list in that IPA each vessel harvesting BS pollock CDQ, on behalf of that CDQ group, that will participate in that IPA.

      (D) Once a member of an IPA, a vessel owner or CDQ group cannot withdraw from the IPA during a fishing year.

      (iii)  The IPA representative must submit a proposed IPA to NMFS at the address in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The proposed IPA must contain the following information:

      (A)  The IPA must include the affidavit affirming that each eligible vessel owner or CDQ group, from whom the IPA representative received written notification requesting to join the IPA, has been allowed to join the IPA subject to the same terms and conditions that have been agreed on by, and are applicable to, all other parties to the IPA.

      (B)

      (C)  The IPA must include the name, telephone number, and email address of the IPA representative who submits the proposed IPA on behalf of the parties and who is responsible for submitting proposed amendments to the IPA and the annual report required under paragraph (f)(13) of this section.

      (D)  The IPA must identify at least one third party group. Third party groups include any entities representing western Alaskans who depend on salmon and have an interest in salmon bycatch reduction but do not directly fish in a groundfish fishery.

      (E)  The IPA must contain a description of the following—

      () The incentive(s) that will be implemented under the IPA for the operator of each vessel participating in the IPA to avoid Chinook salmon and chum salmon bycatch under any condition of pollock and Chinook salmon abundance in all years.

      () How the incentive(s) to avoid chum salmon do not increase Chinook salmon bycatch.

      () The rewards for avoiding Chinook salmon, penalties for failure to avoid Chinook salmon at the vessel level, or both.

      () How the incentive measures in the IPA are expected to promote reductions in a vessel's Chinook salmon and chum salmon bycatch rates relative to what would have occurred in absence of the incentive program.

      () How the incentive measures in the IPA promote Chinook salmon and chum salmon savings in any condition of pollock abundance or Chinook salmon abundance in a manner that is expected to influence operational decisions by vessel operators to avoid Chinook salmon and chum salmon.

      () How the IPA ensures that the operator of each vessel governed by the IPA will manage that vessel's Chinook salmon bycatch to keep total bycatch below the performance standard described in paragraph (f)(_6_) of this section for the sector in which the vessel participates.

      () How the IPA ensures that the operator of each vessel governed by the IPA will manage that vessel's chum salmon bycatch to avoid areas and times where the chum salmon are likely to return to western Alaska.

      () The rolling hot spot program for salmon bycatch avoidance that operates throughout the entire A season and B season and the agreement to provide notifications of closure areas and any violations of the rolling hot spot program to the third party group.

      () The restrictions or penalties targeted at vessels that consistently have significantly higher Chinook salmon PSC rates relative to other vessels fishing at the same time.

      () The requirement for vessels to enter a fishery-wide in-season salmon PSC data sharing agreement.

      () The requirement for the use of salmon excluder devices, with recognition of contingencies, from January 20 to March 31, and from September 1 until the end of the B season.

      () The requirement that salmon savings credits are limited to a maximum of three years for IPAs with salmon savings credits.

      () The restrictions or performance criteria used to ensure that Chinook salmon PSC rates in October are not significantly higher than those achieved in the preceding months.

      (F)  The IPA must include a written statement that all parties to the IPA agree to comply with all provisions of the IPA.

      (G)  The names and signatures of the owner or representative for each vessel and CDQ group that is a party to the IPA. The representative of an inshore cooperative, or the representative of the entity formed to represent the AFA catcher/processor sector or the AFA mothership sector under paragraph (f)(8) of this section may sign a proposed IPA on behalf of all vessels that are members of that inshore cooperative or sector level entity.

      (iv) —(A)  A proposed IPA must be received by NMFS no later than 1700 hours, A.l.t., on October 1 of the year prior to the year for which the IPA is proposed to be effective.

      (B)  Once approved, an IPA is effective starting January 1 of the year following the year in which NMFS approves the IPA, unless the IPA is approved between January 1 and January 19, in which case the IPA is effective starting in the year in which it is approved. Once approved, an IPA is effective until December 31 of the first year in which it is effective or until December 31 of the year in which the IPA representative notifies NMFS in writing that the IPA is no longer in effect, whichever is later. An IPA may not expire mid-year. No party may join or leave an IPA once it is approved, except as allowed under paragraph (f)(12)(v)(C) of this section.

      (C)  Amendments to an approved IPA may be submitted to NMFS at any time and will be reviewed under the requirements of this paragraph (f)(12). An amendment to an approved IPA is effective upon written notification of approval by NMFS to the IPA representative.

      (D)  () NMFS will disapprove a proposed IPA or a proposed amendment to an IPA for either of the following reasons:

      () If the proposed IPA fa_i_ls to meet any of the requirements of paragraphs (f)(12)(i) through (iii) of this section, or

      () If a proposed amendment to an IPA would cause the IPA to no longer be consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(12)(i) through (iv) of this section.

      ()  If, in NMFS' review of the proposed IPA, NMFS identifies deficiencies in the proposed IPA that require disapproval of the proposed IPA, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing. The IPA representative will be provided one 30-day period to address, in writing, the deficiencies identified by NMFS. Additional information or a revised IPA received by NMFS after the expiration of the 30-day period specified by NMFS will not be considered for purposes of the review of the proposed IPA. NMFS will evaluate any additional information submitted by the applicant within the 30-day period. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information addresses deficiencies in the proposed IPA, the Regional Administrator will approve the proposed IPA under paragraphs (f)(1_2_)(iv)(B) and (f)(12)(v)(A) of this section. However, if, after consideration of the original proposed IPA and any additional information submitted during the 30-day period, NMFS determines that the proposed IPA does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (f)(12) of this section, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD) providing the reasons for disapproving the proposed IPA.

      ()  An IPA representative who receives an IAD disapproving a proposed IPA may appeal under the procedures set forth at § 679.4_3_. If the IPA representative fails to file an appeal of the IAD pursuant to § 679.43, the IAD will become the final agency action. If the IAD is appealed and the final agency action is a determination to approve the proposed IPA, then the IPA will be effective as described in paragraph (f)(12)(iv)(B) of this section.

      ()  While appeal of an IAD disapproving a proposed IPA is pending, proposed members of the IPA subject to the IAD that are not currently members of an approved IPA will fish under the opt-out allocation under paragraph (f)(5) of this section. If no other IPA has been approved by NMFS, NMFS will issue all sectors allocations of the _4_7,591 Chinook salmon PSC limit as described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, or, in low Chinook salmon abundance years, allocations of the 33,318 Chinook salmon PSC limit as described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(D) of this section.

      (iv) Trawl vessels participating in directed fishing for pollock and operating under an IPA approved by NMFS under paragraph (f)(12) of this section are exempt from closures in the Chum Salmon Savings Area.

      (15)  Regulations in this paragraph apply to vessels directed fishing for pollock in the BS, including pollock CDQ, and processors taking deliveries from these vessels.

      (i)  The operator of a vessel and the manager of a shoreside processor or SFP must not discard any salmon or transfer or process any salmon under the PSD Program at § 679.26 if the salmon were taken incidental to a directed fishery for pollock in the BS until the number of salmon has been determined by the observer and the observer's collection of any scientific data or biological samples from the salmon has been completed.

      (ii)  (A) Operators of catcher/processors or motherships must—

      () Sort and transport all salmon bycatch from each haul to an approved storage container located adjacent to the observer sampling station that allows an observer free and unobstructed access to the salmon (see § 679.28(d)(2)(i) and (d)(7)). The salmon storage container must remain in view of the observer from the observer sampling station at all times during the sorting of the haul.

      () If, at any point during sorting of a haul or delivery, the salmon are too numerous to be contained in the salmon storage container, cease all sorting and give the observer the opportunity to count the salmon in the storage container and collect scientific data or biological samples. Once the observer has completed all counting and sampling duties for the counted salmon, the salmon must be removed by vessel personnel from the approved storage container and the observer sampling station, in the presence of the observer.

      () Before sorting of the next haul may begin, give the observer the opportunity to complete the count of salmon and the collection of scientific data or biological samples from the previous haul. When the observer has completed all counting and sampling duties for a haul or delivery, vessel personnel must remove the salmon, in the presence of the observer, from the salmon storage container and the observer sampling station.

      () Ensure no salmon of any species pass the observer sample collection point, as identified in the scale drawing of the observer sampling station (see § 679.28(d)(2)(i) and (d)(7)).

      (B) Operators of vessels delivering to shoreside processors or stationary floating processors must—

      () Retain all salmon taken incidental to a directed fishery for pollock in the BS until the salmon are delivered to the processor receiving the vessel's BS pollock catch.

      () Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before handling catch on board the vessel, including, but not limited to, moving catch from one location to another, sorting, or discard of catch prior to the delivery of catch to the processor receiving the vessel's BS pollock catch. This notification requirement is in addition to the notification requirements in § 679.51(e).

      () Secure all salmon and catch after the observer has completed the collection of scientific data and biological samples and after the vessel crew has completed handling the catch. All salmon and any other catch retained on board the vessel must be made unavailable for sorting and discard until the delivery of catch to the processor receiving the vessel's BS pollock catch. Methods to make salmon or retained catch unavailable for sorting or discard include but are not limited to securing the catch in a completely enclosed container above or below deck, securing the catch in an enclosed codend, or completely and securely covering the fish on deck.

      () Comply with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(15)(ii)(B)() and () of this section, before handling the catch prior to delivery.

      (C) Shoreside processors and stationary floating processors must comply with the requirements in § 679.28(g)(9) and (10) for the receipt, sorting, and storage of salmon from deliveries of catch from the BS pollock fishery.

      (iii)  Operators of vessels and managers of shoreside processors and SFPs that are required to retain salmon under paragraph (f)(15)(i) of this section must designate and identify to the observer aboard the vessel, or at the shoreside processor or SFP, a crew person or employee responsible for ensuring all sorting, retention, and storage of salmon occurs according to the requirements of (f)(15)(ii) of this section.

      (iv)  Except for salmon under the PSD Program at § 679.26, all salmon must be returned to the sea as soon as is practicable, following notification by an observer that the number of salmon has been determined and the collection of scientific data or biological samples has been completed.

      (g) —(1)  This paragraph contains regulations governing the bycatch of Chinook salmon in the AI pollock fishery.

      (2)  (i) The PSC limit for Chinook salmon caught by vessels while harvesting pollock in the AI is 700 fish.

      (ii) 7.5 percent of the PSC limit is allocated to the CDQ Program as a PSQ reserve.

      (3)  If, during the fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that catch of Chinook salmon by vessels using trawl gear while directed fishing for pollock in the AI will reach the PSC limit, NMFS, by notification in the  will close the AI Chinook Salmon Savings Area, as defined in Figure 8 to this part, to directed fishing for pollock with trawl gear on the following dates:

      (i) From the effective date of the closure until April 15, and from September 1 through December 31, if the Regional Administrator determines that the annual limit of AI Chinook salmon will be attained before April 15.

      (ii) From September 1 through December 31, if the Regional Administrator determines that the annual limit of AI Chinook salmon will be attained after April 15.

      (h) —(1)  Regulations in this paragraph apply to trawl vessels participating in the directed fishery for groundfish in the Western and Central reporting areas of the GOA and processors receiving deliveries from these vessels.

#### § § 679.25

      (a) —(1)  Inseason adjustments for directed fishing for groundfish, fishing for IFQ or CDQ halibut, or fishing for Cook Inlet EEZ Area salmon issued by NMFS under this section include:

      (i) Closure, extension, or opening of a season in all or part of a management area.

      (ii) Modification of the allowable gear to be used in all or part of a management area.

      (iii) Adjustment of TAC and PSC limits.

      (iv) Interim closures of statistical areas, or portions thereof, to directed fishing for specified groundfish species.

      (v) Inseason closures of an area, district, or portions thereof, of harvest of specified halibut fisheries.

      (vi) Adjustment of TAC for any salmon species or stock and closure or opening of a season in all or part of the Cook Inlet EEZ Area.

      (2)  (i) Any inseason adjustment taken under paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section must be based on a determination that such adjustments are necessary to prevent:

      (A) Overfishing of any species or stock of fish or shellfish;

      (B) Harvest of a TAC for any groundfish species or the taking of a PSC limit for any prohibited species that, on the basis of the best available scientific information, is found by NMFS to be incorrectly specified; or

      (C) Underharvest of a TAC or gear share of a TAC for any groundfish species when catch information indicates that the TAC or gear share has not been reached.

      (ii) Any inseason closure of a statistical area, or portion thereof, under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, must be based upon a determination that such closures are necessary to prevent:

      (A) A continuation of relatively high bycatch rates of prohibited species specified under § 679.21(a) in a statistical area, or portion thereof;

      (B) Take of an excessive share of PSC limits or bycatch allowances established under § 679.21(d) and (e) by vessels fishing in a statistical area, or portion thereof;

      (C) Closure of one or more directed fisheries for groundfish due to excessive prohibited species bycatch rates occurring in a specified fishery operating within all or part of a statistical area; or

      (D) Premature attainment of established PSC limits or bycatch allowances and associated loss of opportunity to harvest the groundfish OY.

      (iii) The selection of the appropriate inseason management adjustments under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be from the following authorized management measures and must be based upon a determination by the Regional Administrator that the management adjustment selected is the least restrictive necessary to achieve the purpose of the adjustment:

      (A) Any gear modification that would protect the species in need of conservation, but that would still allow other fisheries to continue;

      (B) An inseason adjustment that would allow other fisheries to continue in noncritical areas and time periods;

      (C) Closure of a management area or portion thereof, or gear type, or season to all groundfish or halibut fishing; or

      (D) Reopening of a management area or season to achieve the TAC or gear share of a TAC for any of the target species.

      (iv) The adjustment of a TAC or PSC limit for any species under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section must be based upon a determination by the Regional Administrator that the adjustment is based upon the best available scientific information concerning the biological stock status of the species in question and that the currently specified TAC or PSC limit is incorrect. Any adjustment to a TAC or PSC limit must be reasonably related to the change in biological stock status.

      (v) The inseason closure of a statistical area, or a portion thereof, under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section shall not extend beyond a 60-day period unless information considered under paragraph (b) of this section warrants an extended closure period. Any closure of a statistical area, or portion thereof, to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates requires a determination by the Regional Administrator that the closure is based on the best available scientific information concerning the seasonal distribution and abundance of prohibited species and bycatch rates of prohibited species associated with various groundfish fisheries.

      (vi) Any inseason adjustment taken under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section must be based on a determination that such adjustments are necessary to prevent:

      (A) Overfishing of any species or stock of fish or shellfish;

      (B) Harvest of a TAC for any salmon species or stock that, on the basis of the best available scientific information, is found by NMFS to be incorrectly specified; or

      (C) Underharvest of a TAC for any salmon species or stock when catch information indicates that the TAC has not been reached, and there is not a conservation or management concern for any species or stock that would also be harvested with additional fishing effort.

      (vii) The selection of the appropriate inseason management adjustments under paragraphs (a)(1)(vi) of this section must be from the following authorized management measures and must be based on a determination by the Regional Administrator that the management adjustment selected is the least restrictive necessary to achieve the purpose of the adjustment:

      (A) Closure of a management area or portion thereof, or gear type, or season to all salmon fishing; or

      (B) Reopening of a management area or season to achieve the TAC for any of the salmon species or stock without exceeding the TAC of any other salmon species or stock.

      (viii) The adjustment of a TAC for any salmon species or stock under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section must be based upon a determination by the Regional Administrator that the adjustment is based upon the best scientific information available concerning the biological stock status of the species or stock in question and that the currently specified TAC is incorrect. Any adjustment to a TAC must be reasonably related to the change in biological stock status.

      (b)  Information relevant to one or more of the following factors may be considered in making the determinations required under paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) of this section:

      (1) The effect of overall fishing effort within a statistical area;

      (2) Catch per unit of effort and rate of harvest;

      (3) Relative distribution and abundance of stocks of groundfish species, salmon species or stocks, and prohibited species within all or part of a statistical area;

      (4) Condition of a stock in all or part of a statistical area;

      (5) Inseason prohibited species bycatch rates observed in groundfish fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;

      (6) Historical prohibited species bycatch rates observed in groundfish fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;

      (8) Any other factor relevant to the conservation and management of groundfish species, salmon species or stocks, or any incidentally caught species that are designated as prohibited species or for which a PSC limit has been specified.

      (c)  (1) No inseason adjustment issued under this section will take effect until—

      (i) NMFS has filed the proposed adjustment for public inspection with the Office of the Federal Register; and

      (ii) NMFS has published the proposed adjustment in the  for public comment for a period of 30 days before it is made final, unless NMFS finds for good cause that such notification and public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.

      (2) If NMFS decides, for good cause, that an adjustment is to be made without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, public comments on the necessity for, and extent of, the adjustment will be received by the Regional Administrator for a period of 15 days after the effective date of notification.

      (3) During any such 15-day period, the Regional Administrator will make available for public inspection, during business hours, the aggregate data upon which an adjustment was based.

      (4) If written comments are received during any such 15-day period that oppose or protest an inseason adjustment issued under this section, NMFS will reconsider the necessity for the adjustment and, as soon as practicable after that reconsideration, will either—

      (i) Publish in the  notification of continued effectiveness of the adjustment, responding to comments received; or

      (ii) Modify or rescind the adjustment.

      (5) Notifications of inseason adjustments issued by NMFS under paragraph (a) of this section will include the following information:

      (i) A description of the management adjustment.

      (ii) Reasons for the adjustment and the determinations required under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (iii) The effective date and any termination date of such adjustment. If no termination date is specified, the adjustment will terminate on the last day of the fishing year.

The catch of salmon or crab by vessels using other than trawl gear does not accrue to the PSQ for these species. The discard of halibut by vessels using pot gear, jig gear, or hook-and-line gear to harvest sablefish CDQ will not accrue to the halibut PSQ if this bycatch has been exempted from the halibut PSC limit in the annual BSAI specifications published in the

      (c) —(1)

      (i)  Operators and owners of catcher vessels sablefish CDQ fishing must comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(a)(1). Operators and owners of catcher/processors sablefish CDQ fishing must comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(a)(2).

      (ii)  NMFS will use the following data sources to account for catch made by vessels sablefish CDQ fishing with fixed gear:

      (A)  NMFS will use the same information sources that are used to debit sablefish IFQ accounts (see § 679.40(h)) to debit fixed gear sablefish CDQ accounts. This information must be reported through standard reporting requirements in § 679.5.

      (B)  NMFS will use the catch information submitted under standard reporting requirements in § 679.5 to debit any other groundfish CDQ species caught while sablefish CDQ fishing from applicable groundfish CDQ accounts.

      (2) —(i)  Operators of catcher/processors directed fishing for pollock CDQ and motherships taking deliveries of codends from catcher vessels directed fishing for pollock must comply with the following:

      (A) Comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(a)(2).

      (B) Notify the observers of CDQ catch before CDQ catch is brought onboard the vessel and notify the observers of the CDQ group and CDQ number associated with the CDQ catch.

      (C) Comply with the catch weighing and observer sampling station requirements at § 679.63(a).

      (ii) —(A)  NMFS will use observer data as the basis to debit pollock CDQ, groundfish CDQ, and PSQ account balances.

      (B)  NMFS will use the catch information submitted under standard reporting requirements in § 679.5 to debit pollock CDQ, other groundfish CDQ species, and PSQ caught while pollock CDQ fishing from applicable CDQ account balances.

      (3) —(i) —(A)  Operators of vessels in this category must comply with all of the following requirements:

      () Comply with the observer coverage requirements at § 679.5_1_(a)(2).

      () Retain all CDQ species and salmon PSQ until they are delivered to a processor that meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section unless retention of groundfish CDQ species is not authorized under § 679.4 of this part; discard of the groundfish CDQ species is required under subpart B of this part; or, in waters within the State of Alaska, discard is required by laws of the State of Alaska.

      () Retain all halibut and crab PSQ in a bin or other location until it is counted and sampled by the observer.

      () Provide space on the deck of the vessel for the observer to sort and store catch samples and a place from which to hang the observer sampling scale.

      (B)  Operators of vessels in this category must comply with the following requirements:

      () Comply with the observer coverage requirements at § 679.5_1_(a)(2).

      () [Reserved]

      () Comply with the catch monitoring requirements at § 679.9_3_(c).

      (C)  Operators of vessels in this category must comply with the following requirements:

      () Comply with the observer coverage requirements at § 679.5_1_(a)(2).

      () [Reserved]

      () Provide an observer sampling station as described at § 679.28(d).

      () The operator of a mothership taking deliveries of unsorted codends from catcher vessels must weigh all catch, except halibut sorted on deck by vessels participating in halibut deck sorting described at § 679.102, on a scale that complies with the requirements of § 679.28(b). Catch must not be sorted before it is weighed, unless a provision for doing so is approved by NMFS for the vessel. Each CDQ haul must be sampled by an observer for species composition and the vessel operator must allow observers to use any scale approved by NMFS to weigh partial CDQ haul samples.

      (D)  This paragraph applies to all observed catcher vessels using nontrawl gear, except those catcher vessels regulated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Operators of vessels in this category must retain all CDQ species until they are delivered to a processor that meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section unless retention of groundfish CDQ species is not authorized under § 679.4, discard of the groundfish CDQ or PSQ species is required under subpart B of this part, or, in waters within the State of Alaska, discard is required by laws of the State of Alaska. All of the halibut PSQ must be counted and sampled for length or weight by the observer.

      (E)  Operators of vessels in this category must comply with the following requirements:

      () Operators of catcher/processors using hook-and-line gear must comply with § 679._1_00. Operators of catcher/processors using pot gear must comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(a)(2)(vi)(A)(); and

      () [Reserved]

      () Provide an observer sampling station as described at § 679.28(d).

      () Notify the Observer Program by phone at 1 (907) 581-2060 (Dutch Harbor, AK) or 1 (907) _4_81-1770 (Kodiak, AK) at least 24 hours prior to departure when the vessel will be carrying an observer who has not previously been deployed on that vessel within the last 12 months. Subsequent to the vessel's departure notification, but prior to departure, NMFS may contact the vessel to arrange for a pre-cruise meeting. The pre-cruise meeting must minimally include the vessel operator or manager and any observers assigned to the vessel.

      (ii)  NMFS will use the following sources to account for the catch of groundfish CDQ and PSQ species caught by vessels groundfish CDQ fishing.

      (A)  The weight and numbers of groundfish CDQ (including pollock) and PSQ species will be determined by applying the species composition sampling data collected for each CDQ haul by the observer on the mothership to the total weight of each CDQ haul as determined by weighing all catch from each CDQ haul on a scale approved under § 679.28(b).

      (B)  The estimated weight of halibut and numbers of crab PSQ discarded at sea will be determined by using the observer's sample data. The weight or numbers of all landed groundfish CDQ and salmon PSQ will be derived from the delivery information submitted through the eLandings system, as required at § 679.5(e).

      (C)  The weight and numbers of CDQ and PSQ species will be determined by applying the observer's sampling data to the total weight of the CDQ haul.

      (D)  This paragraph applies to all observed catcher vessels using nontrawl gear, except those catcher vessels regulated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. The weight of halibut PSQ discarded at sea will be determined by using the observer's sample data. The weight or numbers of all landed groundfish CDQ and salmon PSQ will be derived from the delivery information submitted through the eLandings system, as required at § 679.5(e).

      (E)  The weight of halibut PSQ and all groundfish CDQ species, except sablefish, will be determined by applying the observer's species composition sampling data to the estimate of total catch weight, if any CDQ species are discarded at sea. Sablefish CDQ caught with fixed gear is accounted for as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (iii) —(A)  Regulations in this paragraph apply to the operators of catcher vessels less than or equal to 46 ft (14.0 m) LOA using hook-and-line gear when groundfish CDQ fishing and to the CDQ groups authorizing the operators of these vessels to harvest groundfish CDQ or halibut CDQ.

      (B)  If any halibut CDQ or halibut IFQ are retained during a fishing trip on board a vessel described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the following requirements apply:

      () The vessel operator must retain all legal-size halibut caught during that entire fishing trip.

      () The vessel operator must have sufficient halibut IFQ or halibut CDQ available to account for the catch of all legal-size halibut caught during the entire fishing trip.

      () If the vessel operator is relying on halibut CDQ from a CDQ group to support the retained catch of legal-size halibut during a fishing trip, the CDQ group must provide adequate halibut CDQ to this vessel operator to account for all of the legal-size halibut caught by the vessel during the entire fishing trip.

      (C)  If halibut CDQ or halibut IFQ are not retained during a fishing trip on board a vessel described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the following requirements apply:

      () The vessel operator must discard all halibut caught during the fishing trip.

      ()  The CDQ group representative may transfer halibut from a CDQ group's halibut PSQ to its small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit. To do so, the CDQ representative must submit a transfer request using the procedures described in § 679.5(n). In reviewing a request to transfer halibut PSQ to a CDQ group's small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit, NMFS will consider whether the amount of halibut to be transferred to the small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit is sufficient to support groundfish CDQ fishing by the catcher vessels that the CDQ group plans to authorize to conduct groundfish CDQ fishing. The transfer is not effective until approved by NMFS. The CDQ group representative also may transfer halibut from a CDQ group's small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit back to its halibut PSQ by submitting a transfer request using the procedures described in § 679.5(n). In reviewing a request to transfer halibut from the small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit back to the CDQ group's halibut PSQ, NMFS will consider the status of CDQ fisheries through the end of the year and anticipated halibut PSC rates for any remaining groundfish CDQ fishing by vessels managed under the small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit for the requesting CDQ group.

      ()  Directed fishing for groundfish CDQ, except sablefish CDQ managed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, by catcher vessels less than or equal to 46 ft LOA using hook-and-line gear is prohibited unless the Regional Administrator publishes notification in the  authorizing such directed fishing. In deciding whether to authorize directed fishing, NMFS will consider whether a CDQ group has sufficient halibut in its small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit to support directed fishing for groundfish CDQ by these catcher vessels. Upon determining that a CDQ group's small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit has been or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for all groundfish CDQ species, except sablefish CDQ, by catcher vessels less than or equal to 46 ft LOA using hook-and-line gear fishing for that CDQ group. If the estimated halibut PSC by vessels described in paragraph (c)(_3_)(iii)(A) of this section exceeds the balance of the small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit on December 31 of any year, and if the CDQ group has remaining halibut PSQ on that date, NMFS will transfer an amount of halibut PSQ into the CDQ group's small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit to bring the balance of the small catcher vessel halibut PSC limit to zero. NMFS will make the determination about whether such an administrative transfer is necessary after data from the fishing year is finalized.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  Managers of shoreside processors or stationary floating processors taking deliveries of pollock CDQ must comply with the requirements at § 679.63(c).

      (ii)  Managers of AFA inshore processors or stationary floating processors taking deliveries of pollock CDQ must follow an approved catch monitoring and control plan as described at § 679.28(g).

      (iii) Comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(b)(2).

      (2)  Managers of shoreside processors and stationary floating processors taking deliveries of groundfish CDQ must comply with the following requirements:

      (i) Comply with observer coverage requirements at § 679.51(b)(1).

      (ii)  Notify the observer of the offloading schedule of each CDQ delivery at least 1 hour prior to offloading to provide the observer an opportunity to monitor the sorting and weighing of the entire delivery.

      (iii)  Sort and weigh on a scale approved by the State of Alaska under § 679.28(c) all groundfish and halibut CDQ or PSQ by species or species group.

      (iv)  Sort and count all salmon and crab PSQ.

      (v)  Sorting and weighing of CDQ and PSQ must be monitored by an observer.

      (e) —(1)  If approved by NMFS under this paragraph (e), vessels participating in a voluntary fishing cooperative in a non-CDQ sector are authorized to conduct groundfish CDQ fishing under the same regulations that apply while such vessels are used to directed fish in the non-CDQ fisheries and are not required to comply with the CDQ harvest regulations in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

      (2)  A CDQ group representative, a representative of an association representing CDQ groups, or the authorized representative of a voluntary fishing cooperative may submit an application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations.

      (3) —(i)  A completed application is comprised of an application form and a copy of the cooperative contract or an affidavit, as described below:

      (A)  The application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations is available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  All information fields must be accurately completed, including information about the applicant, the voluntary fishing cooperative, and the vessels participating in the voluntary cooperative.

      (B)  The application must include either a copy of the current voluntary fishing cooperative contract demonstrating participation in the cooperative by the owners of each of the vessels named on the application form or an affidavit that includes the information required in this paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B). NMFS must be able to determine the following information from the voluntary fishing cooperative contract or the affidavit: the name of the authorized representative of the cooperative; the printed names and signatures of each vessel owner that is a party to the voluntary cooperative; the vessel name, FFP number, and LLP license number for each vessel managed under the cooperative; and the target species, processing mode, gear types, and management area(s) associated with the voluntary cooperative's federal fishing operations. If an applicant submits a copy of the voluntary fishing cooperative contract but it does not contain this information, the applicant also must submit a written affidavit that provides all of the information required in this paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) that is not included in the cooperative contract.

      (ii)  The application for use of non-CDQ harvest regulations must be submitted to the Regional Administrator per the instructions on the application form.

      (iii) —(A)  An application requesting approval for the use of non-CDQ harvest regulations may be submitted to NMFS at any time.

      (B)  Once approved, an application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations is effective as of the date on which NMFS approves the application. The approval is effective until the requesting entity withdraws its application, or until there is a change in the membership of the voluntary cooperative, whichever occurs first.

      (iv)  NMFS will review an application to use non-CDQ harvest regulations to determine that all of the information submitted complies with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, and that the vessels listed on the application form represent a majority of the vessels participating in the applicable sector. If NMFS determines that the application is deficient, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing to identify the discrepancies and provide the applicant with an opportunity to correct them.

      (v)  NMFS will approve an application to use non-CDQ harvest regulations when it determines that all of the information submitted with the application complies with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, the vessels listed on the application form represent a majority of vessels participating in an applicable sector, and the CDQ harvest regulations are more restrictive than the non-CDQ regulations for the applicable sector. NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD) disapproving the application and the reasons for its disapproval if the application is incomplete, the voluntary cooperative does not represent a majority of the vessels participating in the sector, or the CDQ harvest regulations are not more restrictive than the non-CDQ regulations for the applicable sector. An applicant who receives an IAD disapproving an application may appeal under the procedures set forth at § 679.43.

      (vi)  The entity applied for use of non-CDQ harvest regulations must promptly notify NMFS of any changes in the voluntary fishing cooperative's membership by re-applying in accordance with this paragraph (e). Amendments to an approved application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations may be submitted to NMFS at any time, and will be reviewed under the requirements of this paragraph (e).

      § 679.33   CDQ cost recovery.

#### § § 679.33

      (a) —(1)  The person documented with NMFS as the CDQ group representative at the time of a CDQ landing.

      (i) Subsequent transfer, under § 679.31(c), of a CDQ allocation by a CDQ group does not affect the CDQ group representative's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (ii) Changes in amount of a CDQ allocation to a CDQ group do not affect the CDQ group representative's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (2)  Each CDQ group that receives a CDQ allocation of groundfish and halibut is responsible for submitting the cost recovery payment for all CDQ landings debited against that CDQ group's allocations.

      (3) —(i)  A CDQ group representative must submit all CDQ fee payment(s) to NMFS at the address provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the CDQ groundfish and halibut landings were made.

      (ii)  Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.

      (iii)  Submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form. Payments must be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  Instructions for electronic payment will be made available on both the payment Web site and a fee liability summary letter mailed to the CDQ group representative.

      (iv)  Payment must be made electronically in U.S. dollars by automated clearing house, credit card, or electronic check drawn on a U.S. bank account.

      (b) —(1)  A CDQ group representative must use the CDQ standard prices determined by NMFS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  Each year the Regional Administrator will publish _CDQ standard prices_ for groundfish and halibut in the  by December 1 of the year in which the CDQ groundfish and halibut landings were made. The CDQ standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per CDQ equivalent pound for CDQ groundfish and halibut landings made during the current calendar year.

      (ii)  The CDQ standard prices published by NMFS shall apply to all CDQ groundfish and halibut landings made during the current calendar year.

      (iii)  NMFS will calculate the CDQ standard prices for each CDQ fishery as follows:

      (A)  NMFS will calculate the CDQ standard prices for CDQ halibut and CDQ fixed gear sablefish to reflect, as closely as possible by port or port-group, the variations in the actual ex-vessel values of CDQ halibut and fixed-gear sablefish based on information provided in the IFQ Registered Buyer Ex-vessel Volume and Value Report described at § 679.5(l)(7). The Regional Administrator will base CDQ standard prices on the following information:

      () Landed pounds of IFQ halibut and sablefish and CDQ halibut in the Bering Sea port-group;

      () Total ex-vessel value of IFQ halibut and sablefish and CDQ halibut in the Bering Sea port-group; and

      () Price adjustments, including retroactive payments.

      (B)  NMFS will use the standard prices calculated for Pacific cod based on information provided in the Pacific Cod Ex-vessel Volume and Value Report described at § 679.5(u)(1) for _CDQ Pacific cod._

      (C)  NMFS will use the standard prices calculated for AFA pollock described at § 679.66(b) for _CDQ pollock._

      (D)  () NMFS will base all CDQ standard prices for all other CDQ groundfish species on the First Wholesale Volume and Value reports specified in § 679.5(u)(2).

      () NMFS will establish CDQ standard prices for all other CDQ groundfish species on an annual basis; except the Regional Administrator will establish a first CDQ standard price for rock sole for all landings from January 1 through March 31, and a second CDQ standard price for rock sole for all landings from April 1 through December 31.

      () The average first wholesale product prices reported will be multiplied by 0.4 to obtain a proxy for the ex-vessel prices of those CDQ groundfish species.

      (c) —(1)  The _CDQ fee percentage_ for CDQ groundfish and halibut is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This amount will be announced by publication in the  in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This amount must not exceed 3.0 percent pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).

      (2)  Each year NMFS will calculate and publish the CDQ fee percentage according to the following factors and methodology:

      (i)  NMFS will use the following factors to determine the fee percentage:

      (A) The catch to which the CDQ groundfish and halibut cost recovery fee will apply;

      (B) The ex-vessel value of that catch; and

      (C) The costs directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of the CDQ Program for groundfish and halibut.

      (ii)  NMFS will use the following equations to determine the fee percentage: 100 × DPC/V, where:

      (A) DPC = the direct program costs for the CDQ Program for groundfish and halibut for the most recent Federal fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) with any adjustments to the account from payments received in the previous year.

      (B) V = total of the CDQ standard ex-vessel value of the catch subject to the CDQ fee liability for the current year.

      (3) —(i)  NMFS will calculate and announce the CDQ fee percentage in a  notice by December 1 of the year in which the CDQ groundfish and halibut landings were made. NMFS will calculate the CDQ fee percentage based on the calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  NMFS will apply the calculated CDQ fee percentage to CDQ groundfish and halibut landings made between January 1 and December 31 of the same year.

      (4)  The CDQ group representative must use the CDQ fee percentage applicable at the time a CDQ groundfish and halibut landing is debited from a CDQ group's allocation to calculate the CDQ fee liability for any retroactive payments for that CDQ species.

      (5)  (i) Each CDQ group will be subject to a CDQ fee for any CDQ groundfish and halibut debited from that CDQ group's allocation during a calendar year.

      (ii) The CDQ fee assessed to a CDQ group will be based on the proportion of the standard ex-vessel value of CDQ groundfish and halibut debited from a CDQ group's allocation relative to all CDQ groups during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (iii) NMFS will provide a CDQ fee liability summary letter to each CDQ group representative by December 1 of each year. The summary will explain the CDQ fee liability determination including the current fee percentage, and details of CDQ pounds debited from the CDQ group allocations by permit, species, date, and prices.

      (d) —(1) No CDQ group will receive its allocations of CDQ groundfish or halibut until the CDQ group representative submits full payment of that CDQ group's complete CDQ fee liability.

      (2) If a CDQ group representative fails to submit full payment for its CDQ fee liability by the date described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:

      (i) At any time thereafter send an IAD to the CDQ group representative stating that the CDQ group's estimated fee liability, as indicated by his or her own submitted information, is the CDQ fee liability due from the CDQ group.

      (ii) Disapprove any application to transfer CDQ to or from the CDQ group in accordance with § 679.31(c).

      (3) If a CDQ group fails to submit full payment by December 31 of each year, the Regional Administrator will not issue allocations of CDQ groundfish and halibut to that CDQ group for the following calendar year.

      (4) Upon final agency action determining that a CDQ group representative has not paid the CDQ fee liability due for that CDQ group, the Regional Administrator may continue to not issue allocations of CDQ groundfish and halibut for that CDQ group for any subsequent calendar years until NMFS receives the unpaid fees. If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.

      (e)  Upon issuance of final agency action, payment submitted to NMFS in excess of the CDQ fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the CDQ group representative unless the CDQ group representative requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the CDQ group's future CDQ fee liability.

      (f)  A CDQ group representative who receives an IAD for incomplete payment of a CDQ fee liability may appeal under the appeals procedures set out at 15 CFR part 906.

      (g)  Each year, NMFS will publish a report describing the CDQ Cost Recovery Fee Program for groundfish and halibut.

    Subpart D—Individual Fishing Quota Management Measures

      § 679.40   Sablefish and halibut QS.

#### § § 679.40

      The Regional Administrator shall annually divide the annual commercial fishing catch limit of halibut as defined in § 300.61 of this title and published in the  pursuant to § 300.62 of this title, among qualified halibut quota share holders. The Regional Administrator shall annually divide the TAC of sablefish that is apportioned to the fixed gear fishery pursuant to § 679.20, minus the CDQ reserve, among qualified sablefish quota share holders.

      (a) —(1)  The Regional Administrator shall initially assign to qualified persons, on or after October 18, 1994, halibut and sablefish fixed gear fishery QS that are specific to IFQ regulatory areas and vessel categories. QS will be assigned as a block in the appropriate IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, if that QS would have resulted in an allocation of less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish based on the 1994 TAC for fixed gear in those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas and the QS pools of those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas as of October 17, 1994.

      (2)  (i) As used in this section, a “qualified person” means a “person,” as defined in § 679.2:

      (A) That owned a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any IFQ regulatory area in any QS qualifying year; or

      (B) That leased a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any IFQ regulatory area in any QS qualifying year. A person who owns a vessel cannot be a qualified person based on the legal fixed gear landings of halibut or sablefish made by a person who leased the vessel for the duration of the lease.

      (C) Who is a citizen of the United States at the time of application for QS.

      (D) Who is a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that would have qualified to document a fishing vessel as a vessel of the United States during the QS qualifying years of 1988, 1989, and 1990.

      (ii) Qualified persons, or their successors-in-interest, must exist at the time of their application for QS.

      (iii) A former partner of a dissolved partnership or a former shareholder of a dissolved corporation who would otherwise qualify as a person may apply for QS in proportion to his or her interest in the dissolved partnership or corporation.

      (iv) Sablefish harvested within Prince William Sound, or under a State of Alaska limited entry program, will not be considered in determining whether a person is a qualified person.

      (3) —(i)  A QS qualifying year is 1988, 1989, or 1990.

      (ii)  Evidence of vessel ownership shall be limited to the following documents, in order of priority:

      (A) For vessels required to be documented under the laws of the United States, the USCG abstract of title issued in respect of that vessel.

      (B) A certificate of registration that is determinative as to vessel ownership.

      (C) A bill of sale.

      (iii)  Conclusive evidence of a vessel lease will include a written vessel lease agreement or a notarized statement from the vessel owner and lease holder attesting to the existence of a vessel lease agreement at any time during the QS qualifying years. Conclusive evidence of a vessel lease must identify the leased vessel and indicate the name of the lease holder and the period of time during which the lease was in effect. Other evidence, which may not be conclusive, but may tend to support a vessel lease, may also be submitted.

      (iv)  Evidence of ownership interest in a dissolved partnership or corporation shall be limited to corporate documents (e.g., articles of incorporation) or notarized statements signed by each former partner, shareholder or director, and specifying their proportions of interest.

      (v) —(A)  As used in this section, a “legal landing of halibut or sablefish” means halibut or sablefish harvested with fixed gear and landed in compliance with state and Federal regulations in effect at the time of the landing.

      (B)  Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to documentation of state or Federal catch reports that indicate the amount of halibut or sablefish harvested, the IPHC regulatory area or groundfish reporting area in which it was caught, the vessel and gear type used to catch it, and the date of harvesting, landing, or reporting. State catch reports are Alaska, Washington, Oregon, or California fish tickets. Federal catch reports are production reports required under § 679.5. Sablefish harvested within Prince William Sound or under a State of Alaska limited entry program will not be considered in determining qualification to receive QS, nor in calculating initial QS.

      (4) —(i)  The Regional Administrator shall calculate the halibut QS for any qualified person in each IFQ regulatory area based on that person's highest total legal landings of halibut in each IPHC regulatory area for any 5 years of the 7-year halibut QS base period 1984 through 1990. The sum of all halibut QS for an IFQ regulatory area will be the halibut QS pool for that area.

      (ii)  The Regional Administrator shall calculate the sablefish QS for any qualified person in each IFQ regulatory area based on that person's highest total legal landings of sablefish in each groundfish reporting area for any 5 years of the 6-year sablefish QS base period 1985 through 1990. The sum of all sablefish QS for an IFQ regulatory area will be the sablefish QS pool for that area.

      (iii)  Each initial QS calculation will be modified to accommodate the CDQ program prescribed at subpart C of this part.

      (5) —(i)  Each qualified person's QS will be assigned to a vessel category based on the LOA of vessel(s) from which that person made fixed gear legal landings of groundfish or halibut in the most recent year of participation and the product type landed. As used in this paragraph (a)(5), “the most recent year of participation” means the most recent of 4 calendar years in which any groundfish or halibut were harvested using fixed gear, as follows: 1988, 1989, or 1990; or calendar year 1991 prior to September 26, 1991.

      (ii)  QS and its associated IFQ assigned to vessel categories include:

      (A) Category A QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ permit holder to harvest and process IFQ species on a vessel of any length;

      (B) Category B QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ permit holder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel of any length;

      (C) Category C QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ permit holder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA:

      (D) Category D QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ permit holder to harvest IFQ halibut on a vessel less than or equal to 35 ft (10.7 m) LOA, except as provided in § 679.42(a).

      (iii)  A qualified person's QS will be assigned:

      (A) To vessel category A if, at any time during his/her most recent year of participation, that person's vessel processed any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

      (B) To vessel category B if, at any time during his/her most recent year of participation, that person's vessel was greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

      (C) To each applicable vessel category in proportion to the landings of halibut or sablefish made by that person if, at any time during their most recent year of participation, that person used more than one vessel in different categories.

      (iv)  A qualified person's sablefish QS will be assigned:

      (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

      (B) To the vessel category in which halibut and groundfish were landed, or vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear landings of halibut and groundfish, if, at any time during the most recent year of participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no landing(s) of sablefish.

      (v)  A qualified person's halibut QS will be assigned:

      (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m), but greater than 35 ft (10.7 m), LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

      (B) To vessel category D if, at any time during his/her most recent year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 35 ft (10.7 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

      (C) To the vessel category in which groundfish were landed, or vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear landings of groundfish, if, at any time during the most recent year of participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no landing(s) of halibut.

      (vi)  A qualified person's QS for both species will be assigned to the vessel category in which groundfish were landed in the most recent year of participation if, at any time during that year, that person landed halibut in one vessel category and sablefish in a different vessel category.

      (6) —(i)  The Application period for QS ended on July 15, 1994. As of that date, the Request for QS Application form replaced the QS Application form as the means by which the Administrator, RAM, reviews and makes initial administrative determinations on requests for initial allocations of QS. A Request for QS Application must contain the following: information identifying the individual, representative of a deceased fisherman's estate, corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity, or dissolved corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity making the request; contact numbers; vessel identification, length overall, and purchase date; and information on any vessel leasing arrangement pertinent to the claim of eligibility.

      (ii)  An application period of no less than 180 days will be specified by notification in the  and other information sources that the Regional Administrator deems appropriate.

      (iii)  Complete applications received by the Regional Administrator will be acknowledged. An incomplete application will be returned to the applicant with specific kinds of information identified that are necessary to make it complete.

      (7)  Halibut and sablefish catch history, vessel ownership or lease data, and other information supplied by an applicant will be compared with data compiled by the Regional Administrator. If additional data presented in an application are not consistent with the data compiled by the Regional Administrator, the applicant will be notified of insufficient documentation. The applicant will have 90 days to submit corroborating documents (as specified in paragraph (a) of this section) in support of his/her application or to resubmit a revised application. All applicants will be limited to one opportunity to provide corroborating documentation or a revised application in response to notification of insufficient documentation.

      (8)  Uncontested data in applications will be approved by the Regional Administrator. Based on these data, the Regional Administrator will calculate each applicant's initial halibut and sablefish QS, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for each IFQ regulatory area, respectively, and will add each applicant's halibut and sablefish QS for an IFQ regulatory area to the respective QS pool for that area.

      (9)  Catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that cannot be verified by the Regional Administrator, following the procedure described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, will not qualify for QS. An initial determination denying QS on the grounds that claimed catch history, vessel ownership or lease data were not verified may be appealed following the procedure described in § 679.43. Quota share reflecting catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that are contested between two or more applicants, at least one of which is likely to qualify for QS when the dispute is resolved, will be assigned to a reserve that will be considered part of the QS pool for the appropriate IFQ regulatory area. Any QS and IFQ that results from agency action resolving the dispute will be assigned to the prevailing applicant(s) pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this section. If the assigned IFQ for the 1995 fishing season becomes moot by passage of time needed to resolve the dispute, the assignment of QS and IFQ for subsequent fishing seasons will be unaffected.

      (10) NMFS revokes inactive QS if the person holding inactive QS does not:

      (i) Respond in writing to NMFS, within 60 days after NMFS issues a Notice of Determination of Quota Share Inactivity (Inactive QS Notice) sent to the address of record as defined at § 679.43(e) of this part, requesting that the inactive QS not be revoked. Responses must be received by NMFS no later than the date contained on the Inactive QS Notice

      (ii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(10) of this section, “respond in writing” means write a statement directing NMFS to change the status of QS to “active” and sign and date the statement or complete the form attached to the Inactive QS Notice and send by U.S. Mail, courier, hand delivery, or facsimile to the NMFS, Alaska Region as provided on the Inactive QS Notice and printed on the front side of the form. The written response must be received by NMFS no later than the date contained on the Inactive QS Notice or if sent by mail, postmarked by that date. If delivered by hand or courier, the receiving date is the date the notice is stamped received by NMFS.

      (iii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(10) of this section, the term “inactive QS” means halibut QS or sablefish QS, held by a person who received an initial allocation of halibut QS or sablefish QS and has not taken any of the following actions:

      (A) Transferred any halibut QS or sablefish QS pursuant to § 679.41;

      (B) Transferred any halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ pursuant to § 679.41;

      (C) Landed any halibut authorized by IFQ halibut permit(s) issued to that person; or

      (D) Landed any sablefish authorized by IFQ sablefish permit(s) issued to that person.

      (b)  The Regional Administrator shall assign halibut or sablefish IFQs to each person, except the RQE, holding unrestricted QS halibut or sablefish, respectively, up to the limits prescribed in § 679.42(e) and (f). Each assigned IFQ will be specific to an IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, and will represent the maximum amount of halibut or sablefish that may be harvested from the specified IFQ regulatory area and by the person to whom it is assigned during the specified fishing year, unless the IFQ assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator within the fishing year because of an approved transfer or because all or part of the IFQ is sanctioned for violating rules of this part. The Regional Administrator shall assign RFQ to the RQE pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (c) —(1)  (i) The annual allocation of halibut IFQ to any person (person p) in any IFQ regulatory area (area a) will be equal to the product of the annual commercial catch limit as defined in § 300.61 of this title, after adjustment for purposes of the Western Alaska CDQ Program, and that person's QS divided by the QS pool for that area. Overage adjustments will be subtracted from a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section; underage adjustments will be added to a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. Expressed algebraically, the annual halibut IFQ allocation formula is as follows:

      (ii) The annual allocation of sablefish IFQ to any person (person p) in any IFQ regulatory area (area a) will be equal to the product of the TAC of sablefish by fixed gear for that area (after adjustment for purposes of the Western Alaska CDQ Program) and that person's QS divided by the QS pool for that area. Overage adjustments will be subtracted from a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section; underage adjustments will be added to a person's IFQ pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. Expressed algebraically, the annual IFQ allocation formula is as follows:

      (2)  For purposes of calculating IFQs and RFQ for any fishing year, the amount of a person's QS and the amount of the QS pool for any IFQ regulatory area will be the amounts on record with the Alaska Region, NMFS, on January 15 of that year.

      (3)  The Regional Administrator shall issue to each QS holder, pursuant to § 679.4, an IFQ permit specifying the maximum amount of halibut and sablefish that may be harvested with fixed gear in a specified IFQ regulatory area and vessel category. Such IFQ permits will be sent to each QS holder at the address on record for that person prior to the start of the IFQ fishing season or to any IFQ holder(s) following transfers or penalties (15 CFR part 904).

      (4) —(i)  For purposes of calculating RFQ for any fishing year, the amount of halibut QS held by the RQE for either IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A for the corresponding IFQ regulatory area will be the amounts on record with the Alaska Region, NMFS on October 1 of the year prior.

      (ii)  The annual allocation of RFQ halibut to an RQE (person r) in IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A (area a) will be equal to the product of the annual commercial catch limit as defined in § 300.61 of this title, and the QS held by the RQE (specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) divided by the QS pool for that area (specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). No overage or underage adjustments will be applied to the RQE's annual RFQ. Expressed algebraically, the annual RFQ halibut allocation formula is as follows:

      (iii)  NMFS will not issue the RQE any excess RFQ. Excess RFQ is the difference between the amount of RFQ based on the QS held by the RQE and the amount of RFQ needed to provide charter fishery management measures that are equivalent to unguided recreational fishery management measures. If the annual management measures published pursuant to § 300.62 of this title specify charter fishery management measures that are equivalent to the unguided recreational management measures, NMFS will:

      (A) Calculate the annual allocation of halibut RFQ to the RQE as specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section; and

      (B) Determine the amount of RFQ needed to supplement the annual guided sport catch limit from the CSP in Area 2C and Area 3A (described in § 300.65(c) of this title) to account for charter fishery harvests under the charter fishery management measures specified in the annual management measures and issue that amount of RFQ to the RFQ permit account.

      (C) Calculate the amount of excess RFQ by subtracting the amount of RFQ issued as determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section from the annual calculation of RFQ halibut to the RQE as calculated in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section.

      (iv)  Excess pounds of RFQ will be redistributed as IFQ as follows:

      (A) 50 percent to all catcher vessel QS holders in the applicable area who held not more than 32,333 QS units in Area 2C, and 47,469 QS units in Area 3A in the current calendar year and in the calendar year prior to the redistribution, in proportion to their QS holdings; and

      (B) 50 percent divided equally among all CQEs that held halibut QS in the applicable IFQ regulatory area (Area 2C or Area 3A) in the current calendar year and in the calendar year prior to the redistribution. If no CQE held QS in the applicable IFQ regulatory area (Area 2C and Area 3A) in the current calendar year and in the calendar year prior to the redistribution, that RFQ will not be redistributed as IFQ and will not be available for use by any CQE, IFQ permit holder, or RQE in that calendar year.

      (d)  A person's annual IFQ account will be adjusted in the year following a determination that the person harvested or landed IFQ species in an amount is greater than the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account and if the amount greater than the amount available does not exceed 10 percent of the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account at the time of landing. The adjustment would be a deduction of the amount of IFQ species harvested or landed that was determined to exceed the amount available in the person's annual IFQ account and will apply to any person to whom the affected IFQ is allocated in the year following the determination.

      (e)  Underages of up to 10 percent of a person's total annual IFQ account for a current fishing year will be added to that person's annual IFQ account in the year following determination of the underage. This underage adjustment to the annual IFQ allocation will be specific to IFQ species, IFQ regulatory area, and vessel category for which an IFQ is calculated, and will apply to any person to whom the affected IFQ is allocated in the year following determination of an underage.

      (f)  Quota shares allocated or permits issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the “takings” provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such quota shares or permits represent only a harvesting privilege that may be revoked or amended subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable law.

      (g)  (1) Nothing contained in this part 679 shall prohibit any person at any time from retaining and landing a Pacific halibut or sablefish that bears at the time of capture an external research tag from any state, Federal, or international agency, provided that the halibut or sablefish is one of the following:

      (i) A Pacific halibut landed pursuant to § 300.62 of this title and to this part 679; or

      (ii) A sablefish landed in accordance with the Tagged Groundfish Research Program, and in compliance with all sablefish requirements of this part 679.

      (2) Halibut and sablefish bearing an external research tag from any state, Federal, or international agency, landed pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, and in accordance with § 679.5(l), shall be excluded from IFQ or CDQ deduction as follows:

      (i) The fish shall not be calculated as part of a person's IFQ harvest of halibut or sablefish and shall not be debited against a person's halibut IFQ or a person's sablefish IFQ; or

      (ii) The fish shall not be calculated as part of the CDQ harvest of halibut or sablefish and shall not be debited against a CDQ group's halibut CDQ or a CDQ group's sablefish CDQ.

      (iii) The fish will not be calculated as part of the recreational harvest of halibut and will not be debited against the RFQ permit account or the annual guided sport catch limit as defined in § 300.61 of this title.

      (h) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, all IFQ halibut, CDQ halibut, and IFQ sablefish catch onboard a vessel must be weighed and debited from the IFQ permit holder's account or CDQ halibut permit holder's account under which the catch was harvested.

      (2)  A properly concluded sablefish/halibut IFQ landing receipt, crab IFQ landing receipt, or a manual IFQ landing report which is signed by the Registered Buyer and IFQ permit holder or IFQ hired master permit holder or CDQ hired master permit holder constitutes confirmation that the IFQ permit holder's or CDQ permit holder's account is properly debited.

      (3)  NMFS will use the following sources (see paragraphs (h)(3)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this section) of information to debit a CDQ halibut, IFQ halibut, IFQ sablefish, or RFQ permit account:

      (i)  If offload of unprocessed IFQ halibut, CDQ halibut, or IFQ sablefish from a vessel, the scale weight (to the nearest pound) of the halibut or sablefish product actually measured at the time of offload, as required by § _6_79.5(e)(7)(i)(E)() to be included in the IFQ Landing Report.

      (ii)  If offload of processed IFQ halibut, CDQ halibut, or IFQ sablefish from a vessel, the scale weight (to the nearest pound) of the halibut or sablefish processed product actually measured at or before the time of offload. If the product scale weights are taken before the time of offload, then the species and actual product weight of each box or container must be visibly marked on the outside of each container to facilitate inspection by OLE or designees.

      (iii)  All annual RFQ halibut issued to an RQE will be considered landed in the year for which it is issued.

      § 679.41   Transfer of quota shares and IFQ.

#### § § 679.41

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, transfer of QS or IFQ means any transaction requiring QS, or the use thereof in the form of IFQ, to pass from one person to another, permanently or for a fixed period of time.

      (2) Transactions requiring IFQ permits to be issued in the name of a hired master employed by an individual or a corporation are not transfers of QS or IFQ.

      (3) Any transaction involving a transfer between IFQ and guided angler fish (GAF), as defined in § 300.61 of this title, is governed by regulations in § 300.65(c) of this title.

      (b) —(1)  An Application for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) must be approved by the Regional Administrator before a person may use IFQ to harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish, whether the IFQ was the result of a direct transfer or the result of a QS transfer. An Application for Transfer will not be approved until the Regional Administrator has reviewed and approved the transfer agreement signed by the parties to the transaction. The Regional Administrator shall provide an Application for Transfer form to any person on request. Persons who submit an Application for Transfer to the Regional Administrator for approval will receive notification of the Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the Application for Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval, by mail posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode is requested on the Application for Transfer.

      (2)  QS or IFQ accounts affected by an Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Administrator will change on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent with the notification of the Regional Administrator's decision.

      (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an Application for Transfer will not be approved until the Regional Administrator has determined that:

      (1) The person applying for transfer received the QS or IFQ to be transferred:

      (5) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ currently exists.

      (6) The transfer would not cause the person applying to receive the QS or IFQ to exceed the use limits in § 679.42 (e) or (f).

      (7) The transfer would not violate the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section.

      (8)(i) The person applying to make or receive the IFQ or QS transfer has paid all IFQ fees that have become due as a result of an initial administrative determination.

      (ii) The person applying to make or receive the IFQ or QS transfer who has not paid all IFQ fees that are due (as provided under § 679.45(a)) has timely appealed the administrative determination that IFQ fees have not been paid in full and has submitted to NMFS an amount sufficient to satisfy any disputed liability pending a final agency action.

      (9) Other pertinent information requested on the Application for Transfer has been supplied to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator.

      (10) If the person applying to transfer or receive QS or IFQ is a CQE, the following determinations are required for each eligible community represented by that CQE:

      (i) An individual applying to receive IFQ from QS held by a CQE is an eligible community resident of the eligible community in whose name the CQE is holding QS;

      (ii) The CQE applying to receive or transfer QS, has submitted a complete annual report required by § 679.5 (t);

      (iii) If the IFQ to be transferred to a CDQ group results from QS that was transferred to the QS holder after December 14, 2015, the QS holder applying to transfer halibut IFQ to a CDQ group has held the underlying QS for that IFQ for a minimum of 3 years from the date NMFS approved the transfer;

      (iv) If the IFQ to be transferred to a CDQ group is assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D in IFQ regulatory area 4B, the QS holder applying to transfer that halibut IFQ to a CDQ group holds fewer than 76,355 halibut QS units in IFQ regulatory area 4B; and

      (v) The CDQ group applying to receive halibut IFQ has submitted a complete report if required to do so by § 679.5(w).

      (d) —(1)  All persons, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, applying to receive QS or IFQ must submit an Application for Eligibility to Receive QS/IFQ (Application for Eligibility) containing accurate information to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator will not approve a transfer of IFQ or QS to a person until the Application for Eligibility for that person is approved by the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator shall provide an Application for Eligibility form to any person on request.

      (i) An Application for Eligibility is not required for a CQE if a complete application to become a CQE, as described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section, has been approved by the Regional Administrator on behalf of an eligible community.

      (ii) An Application for Eligibility is not required for a CDQ group.

      (2)  A person must indicate on the Application for Eligibility whether the eligibility sought is as:

      (i) An individual; or

      (ii) A corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity.

      (3)  A person may submit the Application for Eligibility with the Application for Transfer or file the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer. If a person, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, files the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer, and that person's status subsequently changes, as described in § 679.42(j), that person must resubmit an Application for Eligibility before submitting, or with, the Application for Transfer.

      (4)  Applicants will be notified by mail of the Regional Administrator's approval of an application for eligibility.

      (5)  The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant if an Application for Eligibility is disapproved. This notification of disapproval will include:

      (i) The disapproved Application for Eligibility.

      (ii) An explanation of why the Application for Eligibility was not approved.

      (6)  Reasons for disapproval of an Application for Eligibility may include, but are not limited to:

      (i) Fewer than 150 days of experience working as an IFQ crew member, unless that person attests in the Application for Eligibility that he or she is an eligible community resident of Adak, AK, who will receive only halibut IFQ in regulatory area 4B or sablefish IFQ in the regulatory area of the Aleutian Islands subarea that is derived from QS held by a CQE on behalf of Adak, AK.

      (ii) Lack of compliance with the U.S. citizenship or corporate ownership requirements specified by the definition of “person” at § 679.2.

      (iii) An incomplete Application for Eligibility.

      (iv) Fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal fishery violations.

      (e) —(1)  A QS block must be transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits specified at § 679.42. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the use limits specified at § 679.42, the Regional Administrator will divide the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount of QS allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the residual QS.

      (2)  QS blocks for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category that represent less than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt) of sablefish IFQ, based on the 1996 TAC share for fixed gear sablefish in a specific IFQ regulatory area and the QS pool for that IFQ regulatory area on January 31, 1996, may be consolidated into larger QS blocks provided that the consolidated blocks do not represent greater than 5,000 lbs (2.3 mt) of sablefish IFQ based on the preceding criteria. A consolidated block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability. The maximum number of QS units that may be consolidated into a single QS block in each IFQ regulatory area is as follows:

      (i) Southeast Outside district: 33,270 QS.

      (ii) West Yakutat district: 43,390 QS.

      (iii) Central GOA regulatory area: 46,055 QS.

      (iv) Western GOA regulatory area: 48,410 QS.

      (v) Aleutian Islands subarea: 99,210 QS.

      (vi) Bering Sea subarea: 91,275 QS.

      (3)  QS blocks for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category that represent less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of halibut IFQ, based on the 1996 catch limit for halibut in a specific IFQ regulatory area and the QS pool for that IFQ regulatory area on January 31, 1996, may be consolidated into larger QS blocks provided that the consolidated blocks do not represent greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of halibut IFQ based on the preceding criteria. In Areas 2C and 3A, QS blocks for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category that represent less than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt) of halibut IFQ, based on the 1996 catch limit for halibut in a specific IFQ regulatory area and the QS pool for that IFQ regulatory area on January 31, 1996, may be consolidated into larger QS blocks provided that the consolidated blocks do not represent greater than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt) of halibut IFQ based on the preceding criteria. A consolidated block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability. The maximum number of QS units that may be consolidated into a single block in each IFQ regulatory area is as follows:

      (i) Area 2C: 33,320 QS.

      (ii) Area 3A: 46,520 QS.

      (iii) Area 3B: 44,193 QS.

      (iv) Subarea 4A: 22,947 QS.

      (v) Subarea 4B: 15,087 QS.

      (vi) Subarea 4C: 30,930 QS.

      (vii) Subarea 4D: 26,082 QS.

      (viii) Subarea 4E: 0 QS.

      (f)  If QS or IFQ must be transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement, but the person receiving the QS or IFQ by transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this section, the Regional Administrator will approve the Application for Transfer with restrictions. The Regional Administrator will not assign IFQ resulting from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with restrictions may not be used for harvesting halibut or sablefish with fixed gear. The QS or IFQ will remain restricted until:

      (1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets the eligibility requirements of this section and the Regional Administrator approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; or

      (2) The Regional Administrator approves the Application for Transfer from the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions to a person who meets the requirements of this section.

      (g)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f), paragraph (g)(2), paragraph (l), paragraph (n) or paragraph (o) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members, or who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D, and meet the eligibility requirements in this section, may receive by transfer QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D, or the IFQ resulting from it.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members, and meet the other requirements in this section, may receive by transfer QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D, or the IFQ resulting from it, in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140° W. long. for sablefish.

      (3) Individuals who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D may transfer that QS to a corporation that is solely owned by the same individual. Such transfers of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140° W. long. for sablefish will be governed by the use provisions of § 679.42(i); the use provisions pertaining to corporations at § 679.42(j) shall not apply.

      (4) The Regional Administrator will not approve an Application for Transfer of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D subject to a lease or any other condition of repossession or resale by the person transferring QS, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (m) of this section, or by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. The Regional Administrator may request a copy of the sales contract or other terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as supplementary information to the transfer application.

      (5) A CQE may not hold QS in halibut IFQ regulatory area 2C that is assigned to vessel category D.

      (i) A CQE may not hold QS in halibut IFQ regulatory area 3A that is assigned to vessel category D on behalf of a community that is located in halibut IFQ regulatory areas 2C or 3B as listed in Table 21 to part 679.

      (ii) In aggregate, CQEs may not hold an amount of QS in halibut IFQ regulatory area 3A that is assigned to vessel category D in excess of 1,233,740 QS units.

      (i) In the GOA may be used only by an eligible community resident of that community.

      (ii) In the Aleutian Islands subarea may be used by any person who has received an approved Application for Eligibility as described in paragraph (d) of this section prior to February 28, 2028 and only by an eligible community resident of Adak, AK, after February 28, 2028.

      (7) A CQE may transfer QS:

      (i) To generate revenues to provide funds to meet administrative costs for managing the community QS holdings;

      (ii) To generate revenue to improve the ability of residents within the community to participate in the halibut and sablefish IFQ fisheries;

      (iii) To generate revenue to purchase QS to yield IFQ for use by community residents;

      (iv) To dissolve the CQE; or

      (v) As a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement.

      (8) If the Regional Administrator determines that a CQE transferred QS for purposes other than those specified in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, then:

      (i) The CQE must divest itself of any remaining QS holdings and will not be eligible to receive QS by transfer for a period of three years after the effective date of final agency action on the Regional Administrator's determination; and

      (ii) The Regional Administrator will not approve a CQE to represent the eligible community in whose name the CQE transferred quota for a period of three years after the effective date of final agency action on the Regional Administrator's determination.

      (9) For transfers of QS to an RQE, the RQE may only receive halibut QS that is assigned to IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A.

      (10) For transfers of QS from an RQE:

      (i) Quota category and block designations at time of purchase by an RQE are retained if QS is transferred to an eligible QS holder for use in the IFQ program.

      (ii) NMFS will not issue any IFQ from any QS transferred from an RQE to a QS holder for use in the IFQ program for a calendar year if that QS resulted in the issuance of RFQ to an RQE during that calendar year.

      (11)(i) To maintain eligibility as the RQE authorized by NMFS, the RQE must be a non-profit entity incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska and recognized as exempt from Federal income tax by the Internal Revenue Service as required by paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (ii) If the Regional Administrator determines the RQE approved by NMFS does not meet the requirements specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, NMFS will notify the RQE of the Regional Administrator's determination and specify that the RQE has 60 days to meet the requirements in paragraph (n)(1) of this section to maintain eligibility as the RQE authorized by NMFS.

      (iii) If the RQE demonstrates to NMFS within 60 days of notification that it meets the requirements in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, NMFS will notify the RQE that it remains the authorized RQE.

      (iv) If the RQE does not demonstrate to NMFS within 60 days of notification that it meets the requirements in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD):

      (A) Revoking authorization of the RQE;

      (B) Disallowing the RQE from receiving any QS by transfer;

      (C) Requiring the CQE to divest of any QS that it holds; and

      (D) Withholding the issuance of RFQ based on any QS that the RQE holds.

      (v) The RQE will have the opportunity to appeal the IAD through the National Appeals Office under the provisions established at 15 CFR part 906.

      (h)  (1) Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, an Application for Transfer must be approved by the Regional Administrator before a person may use any IFQ that results from a direct transfer to harvest halibut or sablefish. After approving the Application for Transfer, the Regional Administrator will change any IFQ accounts affected by the approved transfer and issue all necessary IFQ permits.

      (2) IFQ resulting from categories B, C, or D QS may not be transferred separately from its originating QS, except as provided in paragraph (d), (f), (k), (l), (m), or (o) of this section.

      (i) —(1)  Persons issued CDQ compensation QS in a catcher vessel category, pursuant to § 679.41(j), and in an IFQ regulatory area in which they do not hold QS other than CDQ compensation QS, may use that CDQ compensation QS on any catcher vessel. This exemption from catcher vessel categories ends upon the first transfer of the CDQ compensation QS. CDQ compensation QS being transferred will be permanently assigned to a specific catcher vessel category as designated by the person receiving the transfer.

      (2)  For purposes of this paragraph (i), CDQ compensation QS is QS issued as compensation for halibut and sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ Program, as provided in paragraph (j) of this section.

      (j)  (1) The Regional Administrator will compensate persons that receive a reduced halibut QS in IPHC regulatory areas 4B, 4C, 4D, or 4E because of the halibut CDQ program by adding halibut QS from IPHC regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A. This compensation of halibut QS from areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A will be allocated in proportion to the amount of halibut QS foregone due to the CDQ allocation authorized by this section.

      (2) The Regional Administrator will compensate persons that receive a reduced sablefish QS in any BSAI IFQ regulatory area because of the sablefish CDQ program by taking sablefish QS from the IFQ regulatory areas of the GOA and allocating it in proportion to the loss suffered by persons in the BSAI area. Such additional compensation of sablefish QS will be allocated in proportion to the amount of sablefish QS foregone due to the CDQ allocation authorized by this section.

      (3) Persons initially issued QS for IFQ regulatory areas in which a portion of the TAC is allocated to the CDQ Program will be compensated for halibut and sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ Program. If a person does not hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area on the date the compensation is issued, that person's compensation will be issued as unblocked. If a person does hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area on the date compensation is issued, that person's compensation will be added to their existing QS in that IFQ regulatory area. The resulting QS amount will be blocked or unblocked according to the criteria found at § 679.40(a). Compensation will be calculated for each non-CDQ area using the following formula:

      (k) —(1) On the death of an individual who holds QS or IFQ, the surviving spouse or, in the absence of a surviving spouse, a beneficiary designated pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this section or the estate representative, receives all QS and IFQ held by the decedent by right of survivorship, unless a contrary intent was expressed by the decedent in a will. The Regional Administrator will approve an Application for Transfer to the surviving spouse, designated beneficiary, or estate representative when sufficient evidence has been provided to verify the death of the individual.

      (2) QS holders may provide the Regional Administrator with the name of a designated beneficiary from the QS holder's immediate family to receive survivorship transfer privileges in the event of the QS holder's death and in the absence of a surviving spouse.

      (3) The Regional Administrator will approve an Application for Transfer of IFQ for a period of 3 calendar years following the date of death of an individual to a designated beneficiary. NMFS will allow the transfer of IFQ only resulting from the QS transferred to the surviving spouse or, in the absence of a surviving spouse, from a beneficiary from the QS holder's immediate family designated pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this section or from an estate representative to a person eligible to receive IFQ under the provisions of this section, notwithstanding the limitations on transfers of IFQ in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

      (l)  (1) Each eligible community must designate a CQE to transfer and hold QS on behalf of that community.

      (2) Each eligible community may designate only one CQE to hold QS on behalf of that community at any one time.

      (3) Prior to initially receiving QS by transfer on behalf of a specific eligible community, a non-profit entity that intends to represent that eligible community as a CQE must have approval from the Regional Administrator. To receive that approval, the non-profit entity seeking to become a CQE must submit a complete application to become a CQE to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator will provide a copy of the complete application to the Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development, Commissioner, P.O. Box 110809, Juneau, AK 99811-0809. NMFS will consider comments received from the Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development when reviewing applications for a non-profit entity to become a CQE. The Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development must submit comments on an application to the Regional Administrator within 30 days of receipt of the application in order for those comments to be considered by the Regional Administrator during the approval process. If an application is disapproved, than that determination may be appealed under the provisions established at 15 CFR part 906. A complete application to become a CQE consists of:

      (i) The articles of incorporation under the laws of the State of Alaska for that non-profit entity, except that a non-profit entity that is representing the Metlakatla Indian Village may provide articles of incorporation under Federal Law;

      (ii) A statement indicating the eligible community, or communities, represented by that non-profit entity for purposes of holding QS;

      (iii) Management organization information, including:

      (iv) A statement describing the procedures that will be used to determine the distribution of IFQ to eligible community residents and non-residents of the community represented by that CQE, including:

      (A) Procedures used to solicit requests from eligible community residents and non-residents to lease IFQ; and

      (B) Criteria used to determine the distribution of IFQ leases among qualified community residents and non-residents and the relative weighting of those criteria.

      (v) A statement of support from the governing body of the eligible community as that governing body is identified in Table 21 to this part. That statement of support is:

      (A) A resolution from the City Council or other official governing body for those eligible communities incorporated as first or second class cities in the State of Alaska;

      (B) A resolution from the tribal government authority recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for those eligible communities that are not incorporated as first or second class cities in the State of Alaska; but are represented by a tribal government authority recognized by the Secretary of the Interior; or

      (C) A resolution from a non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity for those eligible communities that are not incorporated as first or second class cities in the State of Alaska, and is not represented by a tribal government authority recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

      () Have articles of incorporation as a non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity; and

      () Have an established relationship with the State of Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development for purposes of representing that community for governmental functions.

      (D) If an eligible community is not incorporated as a first or second class city in the State of Alaska, is not represented by a tribal government authority recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, and does not have a non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity within that community with an established relationship with the Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development for purposes of representing that community for purposes of governmental functions, then the Regional Administrator, NMFS, will not consider any statement from a non-profit entity representing that community until that community:

      () Is incorporated as a first or second class city in the State of Alaska;

      () Establishes a tribal government authority recognized by the Secretary of the Interior; or

      () Establishes a non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity within that community that meets the requirements established in paragraph (E) of this section.

      (E) If a community described under paragraph (l)(3)(v)(D) of this section establishes a non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity within that community, then the Regional Administrator, NMFS, will consider any recommendations from this entity to support a particular applicant after reviewing:

      () Petitions from residents affirming that the non-profit community association, homeowner association, community council, or other non-profit entity within that community represents the residents within that community; and

      () Comments from the State of Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development on the articles of incorporation for that non-profit entity and the ability of that non-profit entity to adequately represent the interests of that community for purposes of governmental functions.

      () If the Regional Administrator determines that this statement of support is not adequate, than that determination may be appealed under the provisions established at 15 CFR part 906.

      (4) The governing body of an eligible community as that governing body is identified in Table 21 to this part, must provide authorization for any transfer of QS by the CQE that holds QS on behalf of that eligible community prior to that transfer of QS being approved by NMFS. This authorization must be submitted as part of the Application for Transfer. That authorization consists of a signature on the Application for Transfer by a representative of the governing body that has been designated by that governing body to provide such authorization to approve the transfer of QS.

      (m)  In the event of a military mobilization or order to report for military service affecting a QS holder that prevents him or her from being able to participate in the halibut or sablefish IFQ fisheries, the Regional Administrator may approve a temporary military transfer for the IFQ derived from the QS held by a QS holder affected by the military mobilization.

      (1)  A temporary military transfer will be approved if the QS holder demonstrates that he or she is unable to participate in the IFQ fishery for which he or she holds QS because of a military mobilization, order to report for military service, or active duty military service.

      (2)  To be eligible to receive a temporary military transfer, a QS holder must meet all of the following requirements:

      (4) Holding or to hold blocks of QS. For purposes of this section, “holding” or “to hold” blocks of QS means being registered by NMFS as the person who received QS by initial assignment or approved transfer.

      (h) —(1)  No vessel may be used, during any fishing year, to harvest more IFQ halibut than one-half percent of the combined total catch limits of halibut for IFQ regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E, except that:

      (i) In IFQ regulatory area 2C, no vessel may be used to harvest more than 1 percent of the halibut catch limit for this area.

      (ii) No vessel may be used, during any fishing year, to harvest more than 50,000 lb (22.7 mt) of IFQ halibut derived from QS held by a CQE, and no vessel used to harvest IFQ halibut derived from QS held by a CQE may be used to harvest more IFQ halibut than the vessel use caps specified in paragraphs (h)(1) introductory text and (h)(1)(i) of this section.

      (iii) Notwithstanding the vessel use caps specified in paragraphs (h)(1) introductory text and (h)(1)(ii) of this section, vessel use caps do not apply to vessels harvesting IFQ halibut in IFQ regulatory Areas 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D during the 2023 through 2027 fishing years. IFQ halibut harvested in regulatory Areas 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D is excluded from the calculation of vessel use caps for IFQ regulatory Area 2C, 3A, or 3B during the 2023 through 2027 fishing years.

      (i) In the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 degrees W. long., no vessel may be used to harvest more than 1 percent of the fixed gear TAC of sablefish for this area.

      (ii) No vessel may be used, during any fishing year, to harvest more than 50,000 lb (22.7 mt) of IFQ sablefish derived from QS held by a CQE, and no vessel used to harvest IFQ sablefish derived from QS and held by a CQE may be used to harvest more IFQ sablefish than the vessel use caps specified in paragraphs (h)(2) introductory text and (h)(2)(i) of this section.

      (3)  An IFQ permit holder who receives an approved IFQ allocation of halibut or sablefish in excess of these limitations may nevertheless catch and retain all that IFQ with a single vessel. However, two or more IFQ permit holders may not catch and retain their IFQs with one vessel in excess of these limitations.

      (4)  Owners and operators of vessels exceeding these limitations are jointly and severally liable with IFQ permit holders and IFQ hired master permit holders whose harvesting causes the vessel to exceed these limitations.

      (i)  In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, IFQ permits issued for IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D must be used only by the individual who holds the QS from which the associated IFQ is derived, except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

      (1) An individual who received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D does not have to be aboard the vessel on which his or her IFQ is being fished or to sign IFQ landing reports if that individual:

      (i) For a documented vessel, during the 12-month period previous to the application by the individual for a hired master permit, continuously owned a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by the U.S. Abstract of Title issued by the U.S. Coast Guard that lists the individual as an owner and, if necessary to show 20-percent ownership for 12 months, additional written documentation; or

      (ii) For an undocumented vessel, during the 12-month period previous to the application by the individual for a hired master permit, continuously owned a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by a State of Alaska license or registration that lists the individual as an owner and, if necessary to show the 20-percent ownership for 12 months, additional written documentation; and

      (iii) Is represented on the vessel by a hired master employed by that individual and permitted in accordance with § 679.4(d)(2).

      (iv) —(A)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate an application for a hired master submitted in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(6), and (i)(7) of this section. An applicant who fails to submit the information specified in the application for a hired master will be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit the specified information or submit a revised application.

      (B)  The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to an individual submitting an application for a hired master submitted in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(6), and (i)(7) of this section if the Regional Administrator determines that the information required to be submitted to NMFS is deficient or if the applicant fails to submit the required information. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information submitted. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal under the appeals procedures set out at § 679.43.

      (v) Upon request by the Regional Administrator or an authorized officer, a person must submit additional written documentation necessary to establish the required minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel during the 12-month period previous to the application by the individual for a hired master permit.

      (2) Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to any individual who received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D and who, prior to April 17, 1997, employed a master to fish any of the IFQ issued to that individual, provided the individual continues to own the vessel from which the IFQ is being fished at no lesser percentage of ownership interest than that held on April 17, 1997, and provided that this individual has not acquired additional QS through transfer after September 23, 1997.

      (3) Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to individuals who received an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory Area 2C or for sablefish QS in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140° W. long., and this exemption is not transferable.

      (4) The exemption provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section may be exercised by an individual on a vessel owned by a corporation, partnership, association or other non-individual entity in which the individual is a shareholder, partner, or member, provided that during the 12-month period previous to the application by the individual for a hired master permit, the individual continuously maintained a minimum 20-percent ownership interest in the vessel owned by the corporation, partnership, association or other non-individual entity. For purposes of this paragraph, an individual's interest in a vessel is determined by the percentage ownership by the individual of a corporation, partnership, association or other non-individual entity that has an ownership interest in the vessel multiplied by the percentage of ownership of the vessel by the corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity.

      (5) IFQ derived from QS held by a CQE must be used only by the individual whose IFQ permit account contains the resulting IFQ.

      (6) In the event of the total loss or irreparable damage to a vessel owned by an individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the individual may remain exempt under paragraph (i)(1) of this section until December 31 of the year following the year in which the vessel was lost or damaged, provided that the individual meets the following requirements:

      (i) The loss or irreparable damage to the vessel was caused by an act of God, an act of war, a collision, an act or omission of a party other than the individual or agent of the individual, or any other event not caused by the willful misconduct of the individual or agent of the individual.

      (ii) The lost or irreparably damaged vessel is a commercial fishing vessel that was previously used to harvest halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ of the individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;

      (iii) As part of the application for exemption, the individual submits to NMFS a copy of the USCG Form 2692 submitted to the USCG as specified in 46 CFR 4.05; and

      (iv) The individual is applying to use a hired master on a vessel in which the individual has a minimum 20-percent ownership interest as of the date of the application by the individual for a hired master permit.

      (7) In the event of temporary disablement of a vessel owned by an individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the individual may remain exempt under paragraph (i)(1) of this section until December 31 of the year following the year in which the vessel was disabled, provided that the individual meets the following requirements:

      (i) The temporary disablement of the vessel results from repairs required by an accident that materially and adversely affected the vessel's seaworthiness or fitness for service, such as from sinking, grounding, or fire;

      (ii) The repairs from the accident require at least 60 days to be completed;

      (iii) The disabled vessel is a commercial fishing vessel that was previously used to harvest halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ of the individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;

      (iv) The individual submits to NMFS a copy of the USCG Form 2692 submitted to the USCG as specified in 46 CFR 4.05; and

      (v) The individual is applying to use a hired master on a vessel in which the individual has a minimum 20-percent ownership interest as of the date of the application by the individual for a hired master permit.

      (8) Paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(4) of this section do not apply to any QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D received by transfer by any person described in paragraph (i)(1) after February 12, 2010, except a hired master may be used to harvest IFQ derived from QS blocks that were consolidated under § 679.41(e)(2) or (e)(3) after February 12, 2010, and before December 1, 2014.

      (j)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(7) of this section, a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D may fish the IFQ resulting from that QS and any additional QS acquired within the limitations of this section from a vessel if that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity:

      (i) For a documented vessel, owns a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by the U.S. Abstract of Title issued by the U.S. Coast Guard that lists the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as an owner and, if necessary to prove the required percentage ownership, other written documentation;

      (ii) For an undocumented vessel, owns a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by a State of Alaska vessel license or registration that lists the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as an owner and, if necessary to show the required percentage ownership interest, other written documentation; and

      (iii) Is represented on the vessel by a hired master employed by that individual and permitted in accordance with § 679.4(d)(2).

      (2) The provision of paragraph (j)(1) of this section is not transferable and does not apply to QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory Area 2C or for sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140° W. long. that is transferred to a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity. Such transfers of additional QS within these areas must be to an individual pursuant to § 679.41(c) and be used pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (i) of this section.

      (3) A corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity, except for a publicly held corporation, that receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D loses the exemption provided under this paragraph (j) on the effective date of a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity from that which existed at the time of initial allocation.

      (4) For purposes of this paragraph (j), “a change” means:

      (i) For corporations and partnerships, the addition of any new shareholder(s) or partner(s), except that a court appointed trustee to act on behalf of a shareholder or partner who becomes incapacitated is not a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity; or

      (ii) For estates, the final or summary distribution of the estate.

      (5) The Regional Administrator must be notified of a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as defined in this paragraph (j) within 15 days of the effective date of the change. The effective date of change, for purposes of this paragraph (j), is the date on which the new shareholder(s) or partner(s) may realize any corporate liabilities or benefits of the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity or, for estates, the date of the determination of a legal heir to the estate, or the date of the order for distribution of the estate.

      (6) QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D and IFQ resulting from that QS held in the name of a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that changes, as defined in this paragraph (j), must be transferred to an individual, as prescribed in § 679.41, before it may be used at any time after the effective date of the change.

      (7) A corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D and that, prior to April 17, 1997, employed a master to fish any of the IFQ issued to that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity may continue to employ a master to fish its IFQ on a vessel owned by the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity provided that the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity continues to own the vessel at no lesser percentage of ownership interest than that held on April 17, 1997, and provided that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity did not acquire additional QS through transfer after September 23, 1997.

      (8) A corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity, except for a publicly held corporation, that receives an allocation of QS must provide annual updates to the Regional Administrator identifying all current shareholders, partners, or members to the individual person level and affirming the entity's continuing existence as a corporation or partnership, or other non-individual entity.

      (a)  This section describes the procedure for appealing initial administrative determinations made in this title under parts 300, 679, 680, and subpart E of part 300 of this chapter.

      (b)  Any person whose interest is directly and adversely affected by an initial administrative determination may file a written appeal. For purposes of this section, such persons will be referred to as “applicant” or “appellant.”

      (c)  An appeal to an initial administrative determination must be submitted under the appeals procedure set out at 15 CFR part 906.

      (d)  (1) If an applicant appeals an initial administrative determination, the appeal must be filed not later than 60 days after the date the determination is issued.

      (2) The time period within which an appeal may be filed begins to run on the date the initial administrative determination is issued. If the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the next business day.

      (e)  —NMFS will establish as the address of record the address used by the applicant in initial correspondence to NMFS concerning the application. Notifications of all actions affecting the applicant after establishing an address of record will be mailed to that address, unless the applicant provides NMFS, in writing, with any changes to that address. NMFS bears no responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS.

      (f)  Applicants must timely submit a full written statement in support of the appeal, including a concise statement of the reasons the initial administrative determination has a direct and adverse effect on the applicant and should be reversed or modified. If the applicant requests a hearing on any issue presented in the appeal, such request for hearing must be accompanied by a concise written statement raising genuine and substantial issues of adjudicative fact for resolution and a list of available and specifically identified reliable evidence upon which the factual issues can be resolved. The appellate officer will limit his/her review to the issues stated in the appeal; all issues not set out in the appeal will be waived.

      (g)  The appellate officer will review the applicant's appeal and request for hearing, and has discretion to proceed as follows:

      § 679.44   Penalties.

#### § § 679.44

      Any person committing, or a fishing vessel used in the commission of, a violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or Halibut Act, or any regulation issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act or Halibut Act, is subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and civil forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or Halibut Act, to part 600 of this chapter, to 15 CFR part 904 (Civil Procedures), and to other applicable law. Penalties include but are not limited to permanent or temporary sanctions to QS and associated IFQ.

      § 679.45   IFQ cost recovery program.

#### § § 679.45

      (a) —(1)  An IFQ permit holder is responsible for cost recovery fees for landings of his or her IFQ halibut and sablefish, including any halibut landed as guided angler fish (GAF), as defined in § 300.61 of this title, derived from his or her IFQ accounts. An RQE is responsible for cost recovery fees for all RFQ issued to the RQE. An IFQ permit holder or RQE must comply with the requirements of this section.

      (2) —(i)  IFQ fee liability means a cost recovery liability based on either the value of all landed IFQ and GAF derived from the permit holder's IFQ permit(s), or the value of all RFQ issued to an RQE.

      (A) Each year, the Regional Administrator will issue each IFQ permit holder a summary of his or her IFQ equivalent pounds landed as IFQ and GAF and will issue an RQE a summary of its RFQ pounds issued as part of the IFQ Landing and Estimated Fee Liability page described at § 679.5(l)(7)(ii)(D).

      (B) The summary will include information on IFQ and GAF landings and an estimated IFQ fee liability using the IFQ standard ex-vessel value for IFQ and GAF landings. For fee purposes:

      () Landings of GAF in IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A are converted to IFQ equivalent pounds and assessed at the IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A IFQ standard ex-vessel value.

      () GAF that is returned to the IFQ permit holder's account pursuant to § 300.65(c) of this title, and subsequently landed as IFQ during the IFQ fishing year, is included in the IFQ fee liability and subject to fee assessment as IFQ equivalent pounds.

      () All RFQ issued to an RQE in IFQ regulatory area 2C or _3_A will be assessed at the IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A IFQ standard ex-vessel value.

      (C) The IFQ permit holder must either accept NMFS' estimate of the IFQ fee liability or revise NMFS' estimate of the IFQ fee liability using the IFQ Permit Holder Fee Submission Form described at § 679.5(l)(7)(ii), except that the standard ex-vessel value used to determine the fee liability for GAF is not subject to challenge. If the IFQ permit holder revises NMFS' estimate of his or her IFQ fee liability, NMFS may request in writing that the permit holder submit documentation establishing the factual basis for the revised calculation. If the IFQ permit holder fails to provide adequate documentation on or by the 30th day after the date of such request, NMFS will determine the IFQ permit holder's IFQ fee liability based on standard ex-vessel values.

      (D) An RQE may not challenge the standard ex-vessel value used to determine the fee liability for all RFQ issued to the RQE.

      (ii)  The IFQ fee liability is computed from all net pounds allocated to the IFQ permit holder that are landed, including IFQ landed as GAF.

      (A) NMFS will determine the IFQ equivalent pounds of GAF landed in IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A that are derived from the IFQ permit holder's account.

      (B) The IFQ equivalent pounds of GAF landed in IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A are multiplied by the standard ex-vessel value computed for that area to determine the value of IFQ landed as GAF.

      (iii) The value of IFQ landed as GAF is added to the value of the IFQ permit holder's landed IFQ, and the sum is multiplied by the annual IFQ fee percentage to estimate the IFQ permit holder's IFQ fee liability.

      (3)  (i) An IFQ permit holder with IFQ and/or GAF landings is responsible for collecting his or her own fee during the calendar year in which the IFQ fish and/or GAF are landed.

      (ii) An RQE is responsible for collecting its own fees during the calendar year in which the RFQ is issued to the RQE.

      (4) —(i)  An IFQ permit holder or RQE must submit its IFQ fee liability payment(s) to NMFS as instructed at paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section not later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the IFQ or GAF landings were made or the RFQ was issued to the RQE.

      (ii)  Make payment payable to NMFS.

      (iii)  Submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form. Payments may be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  Instructions for electronic payment will be made available on both the payment Web site and a fee liability summary letter mailed to the IFQ permit holder.

      (iv) —(A) Prior to December 1, 2019, payment must be made in U.S. dollars by personal check drawn on a U.S. bank account, money order, bank-certified check, or electronically by credit card.

      (B) On or after December 1, 2019, payment must be made electronically in U.S. dollars by automated clearing house, credit card, or electronic check drawn on a U.S. bank account.

      (b) —(1)  (i) An IFQ permit holder must use either the IFQ actual ex-vessel value or the IFQ standard ex-vessel value when determining the IFQ fee liability based on ex-vessel value, except that landed GAF are assessed at the standard ex-vessel values derived by NMFS. An IFQ permit holder must base all fee liability calculations on the ex-vessel value that correlates to landed IFQ in IFQ equivalent pounds.

      (ii) An RQE must use the IFQ standard ex-vessel value derived by NMFS for all RFQ issued to the RQE.

      (2)  An IFQ permit holder that uses actual ex-vessel value, as defined in § 679.2, to determine IFQ fee liability for landed IFQ must document actual ex-vessel value for each IFQ permit. The actual ex-vessel value cannot be used to assign value to halibut landed as GAF or issued as RFQ.

      (3) —(i)  An IFQ permit holder that uses standard ex-vessel value to determine the IFQ fee liability, as part of a revised IFQ fee liability submission, must use the corresponding standard price(s) as published in the

      (ii) All landed GAF and RFQ issued to an RQE must be valued using the standard ex-vessel value for the year and for the IFQ regulatory area of harvest—Area 2C or Area 3A.

      (iii)  Each year the Regional Administrator will publish a list of IFQ standard prices in the  during the last quarter of the calendar year. The IFQ standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per IFQ equivalent pound, for IFQ halibut and sablefish landings made during the current calendar year.

      (iv)  The IFQ standard prices will remain in effect until revised by the Regional Administrator by notification in the  based upon new information of the type set forth in this section. IFQ standard prices published in the  by NMFS shall apply to all landings made in the same calendar year as the IFQ standard price publication and shall replace any IFQ standard prices previously provided by NMFS that may have been in effect for that same calendar year.

      (v)  NMFS will apply the standard price, aggregated by IFQ regulatory area 2C or 3A, to GAF landings and RFQ issued to an RQE. NMFS will calculate the IFQ standard prices to reflect, as closely as possible by month and port or port-group, the variations in the actual ex-vessel values of IFQ halibut and IFQ sablefish landings based on information provided in the IFQ Registered Buyer Ex-Vessel Value and Volume Report as described in § 679.5(l)(7)(i). The Regional Administrator will base IFQ standard prices on the following types of information:

      (A) Landed net pounds by IFQ species, port-group, and month;

      (B) Total ex-vessel value by IFQ species, port-group, and month; and

      (C) Price adjustments, including IFQ retro-payments.

      (c) [Reserved]

      (d) —(1)  The annual _IFQ fee percentage_ is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This amount will be announced by publication in the  in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section. This amount must not exceed 3 percent pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).

      (2)  Each year NMFS shall calculate and publish the fee percentage according to the following factors and methodology:

      (i)  NMFS must use the following factors to determine the fee percentage:

      (A) The IFQ, RFQ, and GAF landings to which the IFQ fee will apply;

      (B) The ex-vessel value of that landed IFQ, RFQ, and GAF; and

      (C) The costs directly related to the management and enforcement of the IFQ Program, which include RQE and GAF costs.

      (ii)  NMFS must use the following equation to determine the fee percentage:

      (3) —(i)  During or before the last quarter of each calendar year, NMFS shall publish the IFQ fee percentage in the  NMFS shall base any IFQ fee liability calculations on the factors and methodology in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  The calculated IFQ fee percentage shall remain in effect through the end of the calendar year in which it was determined.

      (4)  The IFQ permit holder must use the IFQ fee percentage in effect for the year in which the IFQ, RFQ, and GAF landings are made to calculate his or her fee liability for such landed IFQ, RFQ, and GAF. The IFQ permit holder or RQE must use the IFQ fee percentage in effect at the time an IFQ retro-payment is received by the IFQ permit holder to calculate his or her IFQ fee liability for the IFQ retro-payment.

      (e)  (1) If an IFQ permit holder or RQE does not submit a complete IFQ Permit Holder Fee Submission Form and corresponding payment by the due date described in § 679.45(a)(4), the Regional Administrator will:

      (i)  Send an IAD to the IFQ permit holder or RQE stating that the estimated fee liability, as calculated by the Regional Administrator and sent to the IFQ permit holder or RQE pursuant to § 679.45(a)(2), is the amount of IFQ fee liability due from the IFQ permit holder or RQE. An IFQ permit holder or RQE who receives an IAD may appeal the IAD, as described in paragraph (h) of this section.

      (ii)  Disapprove any transfer of GAF, IFQ, or QS to or from the IFQ permit holder or RQE in accordance with § 300.65(c) of this title and § 679.41(c), until the IFQ fee liability is reconciled, except that NMFS may return unused GAF to the IFQ permit holder's account from which it was derived on or after the automatic GAF return date.

      (2) Upon final agency action determining that an IFQ permit holder has not paid his or her IFQ fee liability, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, any IFQ fishing permit or RFQ permit account held by the IFQ permit holder or RQE is not valid until all IFQ fee liabilities are paid.

      (3) If payment is not received on or before the 30th day after the final agency action, the matter will be referred to the appropriate authorities for purposes of collection.

      (f)  (1) When an IFQ permit holder or RQE has incurred a fee liability and made a timely payment to NMFS of an amount less than the NMFS estimated IFQ fee liability, the Regional Administrator will review the IFQ Permit Holder Fee Submission Form and related documentation submitted by the IFQ permit holder or RQE. If the Regional Administrator determines that the IFQ permit holder or RQE has not paid a sufficient amount, the Regional Administrator will:

      (i)  Disapprove any transfer of GAF, IFQ, or QS to or from the IFQ permit holder or RQE in accordance with § 300.65(c) of this title and § 679.41(c), until the IFQ fee liability is reconciled, except that NMFS may return unused GAF to the IFQ permit holder's account from which it was derived 15 days prior to the closing of the commercial halibut fishing season each year.

      (ii)  Notify the IFQ permit holder or RQE by letter that an insufficient amount has been paid and that the IFQ permit holder has 30 days from the date of the letter to either pay the amount determined to be due or provide additional documentation to prove that the amount paid was the correct amount.

      (2) After the expiration of the 30-day period, the Regional Administrator will evaluate any additional documentation submitted by an IFQ permit holder or RQE in support of its payment. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional documentation does not meet the burden of proving the payment is correct, the Regional Administrator will send the IFQ permit holder or RQE an IAD indicating that the IFQ permit holder or RQE did not meet the burden of proof to change the IFQ fee liability as calculated by the Regional Administrator based upon the IFQ standard ex-vessel value. The IAD will set out the facts and indicate the deficiencies in the documentation submitted by the IFQ permit holder or RQE. An IFQ permit holder or RQE who receives an IAD may appeal the IAD, as described in paragraph (h) of this section.

      (3) If the permit holder fails to file an appeal of the IAD pursuant to 15 CFR part 906, the IAD will become the final agency action.

      (4) If the IAD is appealed and the final agency action is a determination that additional sums are due from the IFQ permit holder or RQE, the IFQ permit holder or RQE must pay any IFQ fee amount determined to be due not later than 30 days from the issuance of the final agency action.

      (5) Upon final agency action determining that an IFQ permit holder or RQE has not paid his or her IFQ fee liability, any IFQ fishing permit held by the IFQ permit holder or RQE is not valid until all IFQ fee liabilities are paid.

      (6) If payment is not received on or before the 30th day after the final agency action, the matter will be referred to the appropriate authorities for purposes of collection.

      (g)  Upon issuance of final agency action, any amount submitted to NMFS in excess of the IFQ fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the IFQ permit holder or RQE unless the IFQ permit holder or RQE requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the IFQ permit holder's or RQE's future IFQ fee liability.

      (h)  An IFQ permit holder who receives an IAD may either appeal the IAD pursuant to 15 CFR part 906 or request reconsideration. Within 60 days from the date of issuance of the IAD, the Regional Administrator may undertake a reconsideration of the IAD on his or her own initiative. If a request for reconsideration is submitted or the Regional Administrator initiates a reconsideration, the 60-day period for appeal under 15 CFR part 906 will begin anew upon issuance of the Regional Administrator's reconsidered IAD. The Regional Administrator may undertake only one reconsideration of the IAD, if any. If an IFQ permit holder fails to file an appeal of the IAD pursuant to 15 CFR part 906, the IAD will become the final agency action. In any appeal or reconsideration of an IAD made under this section, an IFQ permit holder has the burden of proving his or her claim.

      (i)  NMFS will publish annually a report describing the status of the IFQ Cost Recovery Program.

      (ii)  The Observer Declare and Deploy System (ODDS) is the communication platform for the partial coverage category by which NMFS receives information about fishing plans subject to randomized observer deployment. Vessel operators provide fishing plan and contact information to NMFS and receive instructions through ODDS for coordinating with an observer provider for any required observer coverage. Access to ODDS is available through the NMFS Alaska Region website

      (A)  NMFS will enter information into ODDS about all partial coverage category vessels that are designated on an FFP and all catcher vessels that are not designated on an FFP but that landed sablefish IFQ or halibut IFQ or CDQ in the previous or current year. Owners or operators are not responsible for initial registration of their vessel in ODDS.

      (B)  Upon entry into ODDS, NMFS will notify the owner or operator of his or her vessel's selection pool. Owners and operators must comply with all further instructions set forth by ODDS.

      (C)  () A minimum of 72 hours prior to embarking on each fishing trip, the operator of a vessel in the trip selection pool must register the anticipated trip with ODDS.

      () When a fishing trip is registered with ODDS per paragraph (a)(_1_)(ii)(C)() of this section, the vessel operator will be notified by ODDS whether the trip is selected for observer coverage and a receipt number corresponding to this notification will be provided by ODDS. Trip registration is complete when the vessel operator receives a receipt number.

      () An operator may embark on a fishing trip registered with ODDS:

      ()  At any t_i_me if ODDS indicates that the fishing trip is not selected for observer coverage.

      ()  When an observer is aboard the vessel if ODDS indicates that the fishing trip is selected for observer coverage.

      ()  A selected fishing trip not embarked upon within _4_8 hours of the time specified in the registration with ODDS is invalidated. The operator must register any new trip in accordance with paragraph (a)(_1_)(ii)(C)() of this section.

      ()  If selected, a vessel is required to carry an observer for the entire fishing trip.

      () A f_i_shing trip selected for observer coverage may not begin until all previously harvested fish has been offloaded and an observer is aboard the vessel.

      () An observer may not be transferred off a catcher vessel until the observer confirms that all fish from the observed fishing trip are offloaded.

      () A vessel must make a minimum of one delivery to a tender vessel to be subject to paragraph (3)(ii) of the fishing trip definition at § 679.2.

      (D)  A vessel selected for observer coverage is required to have an observer on board for all groundfish and halibut fishing trips specified at paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for the time period indicated by ODDS.

      (ii)  An observer certification will be issued upon determination by the NMFS observer certification official that the candidate has successfully met all requirements for certification as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (5)  The following endorsements must be obtained, in addition to observer certification, in order for an observer to deploy as indicated.

      (i)  A certification training endorsement signifies the successful completion of the training course required to obtain this endorsement. A certification training endorsement is required for any deployment as an observer in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands groundfish fisheries and the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries or Halibut Act fisheries and will be granted with the initial issuance of an observer certification. This endorsement expires when the observer has not been deployed and performed sampling duties as required by the Observer Program for a period of time specified by the Observer Program after his or her most recent debriefing. In order to renew the endorsement, the observer must successfully retake the certification training. Observers will be notified of any changes to the endorsement expiration period prior to the effective date of the change.

      (ii)  Each observer must obtain an annual general endorsement to their certification prior to his or her initial deployment within any calendar year subsequent to a calendar year in which a certification training endorsement is obtained. To obtain an annual general endorsement, an observer must successfully complete the annual briefing, as specified by the Observer Program. All briefing attendance, performance, and conduct standards required by the Observer Program must be met.

      (iii)  Each observer who has completed an initial deployment after certification or annual briefing must receive a deployment endorsement to their certification prior to any subsequent deployments for the remainder of that year. An observer may obtain a deployment endorsement by successfully completing all pre-cruise briefing requirements. The type of briefing the observer must attend and successfully complete will be specified in writing by the Observer Program during the observer's most recent debriefing.

      (iv)  A certified observer may obtain a level 2 endorsement to their certification. A level 2 endorsement is required for purposes of performing observer duties aboard vessels or stationary floating processors or at shoreside processors participating in fisheries as prescribed in § 679.51(a)(2)(vi)(A) through (H).

      § 679.55   Observer fees.

#### § § 679.55

      (a)  The owner of a shoreside processor or stationary floating processor named on a Federal Processing Permit (FPP), a catcher/processor named on a Federal Fisheries Permit (FFP), or a person named on a Registered Buyer permit at the time of the landing subject to the observer fee as specified at § 679.55(c) must comply with the requirements of this section. Subsequent non-renewal of an FPP, FFP, or a Registered Buyer permit does not affect the permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (b)  After each fishing year, the Regional Administrator will mail an observer fee liability invoice to each permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of this section for landings of groundfish and halibut subject to the observer fee. The observer fee liability invoice will provide a summary of the round pounds of groundfish and headed-and-gutted weight for halibut landed during the previous fishing year for each permit by species, landing port or port-group, and gear category. The total fee liability for each permit holder will be determined by applying the observer fee percentage in paragraph (f) of this section to the ex-vessel value of the groundfish and halibut landings subject to the observer fee. The method for determining the ex-vessel value of the groundfish and halibut landings subject to the observer fee is provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The fee liability will be assessed on the groundfish round weight and the headed-and-gutted weight for halibut.

      (c)  The observer fee is assessed on landings by vessels not in the full observer coverage category described at § 679.51(a)(2) according to the following table:

      (d) —(1)  NMFS will publish the standard ex-vessel prices used to determine the observer fee in the upcoming year in the  during the last quarter of each calendar year. The standard ex-vessel prices will be described in U.S. dollars per equivalent round pound for groundfish and per equivalent headed-and-gutted weight for halibut.

      (2)  The standard ex-vessel prices will remain in effect until revised by subsequent publication in the

      (3) —(i)  Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, NMFS will calculate groundfish standard ex-vessel prices based on standardized ex-vessel nominal prices calculated using information submitted in the Commercial Operator's Annual Report described at § 679.5(p) and the shoreside processor or stationary floating processor landing report described at § 679.5(e)(5), as well as methods established by the State of Alaska's Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.

      (A) Groundfish standard ex-vessel prices will be calculated as a 3-year rolling average of standard prices for each species, port or port-group, and gear.

      (B) Gear categories for groundfish standard ex-vessel prices are: Pelagic trawl gear, non-pelagic trawl gear, and non-trawl gear.

      (ii)  NMFS will use data submitted to NMFS on the IFQ Registered Buyer report under § 679.5(l)(7) to calculate the standard ex-vessel prices for each year for halibut and fixed gear sablefish, by port or port group. These standard ex-vessel prices will be applied to landings of:

      (A) Halibut;

      (B) IFQ sablefish; and

      (C) Sablefish accruing against the fixed-gear sablefish CDQ allocation.

      (iii)  Standard ex-vessel prices will be aggregated among ports if fewer than four processors participate in a price category for any species and gear combination.

      (e)  The ex-vessel value of groundfish and halibut subject to the observer fee will be determined by applying the standard ex-vessel price published in the  in the year prior to the year in which the landing was made to the round weight of groundfish and the headed-and-gutted weight of halibut landings subject to the observer fee.

      (f)  The observer fee percentage is 1.25 percent through December 31, 2020. Beginning January 1, 2021, the observer fee percentage is 1.65 percent.

      (g)  A permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of this section, receiving a groundfish or halibut landing subject to the observer fee under paragraph (c) of this section, is responsible for collecting fees during the calendar year in which the groundfish or halibut is received.

      (h) —(1)  A permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of this section must submit his or her observer fee liability payment(s) to NMFS no later than February 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the groundfish or halibut landings subject to the observer fee were made.

      (2)  Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.

      (3)  Payments must be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  Instructions for electronic payment will be provided on the payment Web site and on the observer fee liability invoice to be mailed to each permit holder.

      (4)  Payment must be made electronically in U.S. dollars by automated clearinghouse, credit card, or electronic check drawn on a U.S. bank account.

      (5)  (i) Under § 679.4, an applicant will not receive a new or amended FPP or Registered Buyer permit until he or she submits a complete permit application. For the application to be considered complete, all fees required by NMFS must be paid.

      (ii) If a permit holder fails to submit full payment for the observer fee liability by the date described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:

      (A) At any time thereafter send an initial administrative determination to the liable permit holder stating that the permit holder's estimated fee liability, as calculated by the Regional Administrator and sent to the permit holder pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, is the amount of observer fee due from the permit holder.

      (B) Disapprove any issuance of an FPP or Registered Buyer permit to the applicant in accordance with § 679.4.

      (iii) If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.

      (i)  Upon issuance of final agency action, any amount submitted to NMFS in excess of the observer fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the permit holder unless the permit holder requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the permit holder's future observer fee liability.

      (j)  A permit holder who receives an IAD may either pay the fee liability or appeal the IAD pursuant to § 679.43. In any appeal of an IAD made under this section, a permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of this section has the burden of proving his or her claim.

      § 679.56   Full coverage trawl Electronic Monitoring category fee.

#### § § 679.56

      (a) —(1)  The owner of a catcher vessel in the full coverage trawl EM category must comply with the requirements of this section. Subsequent opting out of the trawl EM category does not affect the FFP permit holder's liability for paying the full coverage trawl EM category fee for any fishing year in which the vessel was approved to be in the full coverage trawl EM category and made pollock landings. Subsequent transfer of an AFA catcher vessel or AFA permit does not affect the catcher vessel owner's liability for non-compliance with this section.

      (2)  The full coverage trawl EM fee is assessed on pollock landings by catcher vessels in the full coverage trawl EM category as specified in § 679.51(g).

      (3)  The owner of a catcher vessel (as identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) is responsible for paying the full coverage trawl EM fee for all pollock landings.

      (4) —(i)  The owner of a catcher vessel (as identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) must submit all full coverage trawl EM fee payments to NMFS no later than May 31 of the fishing year following the year in which the pollock landings occurred.

      (ii)  The owner of a catcher vessel (as identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) must submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form. Payments must be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region website. Instructions for electronic payment will be made available on both the payment website and a fee liability summary letter mailed to each permit holder.

      (b)  NMFS will use the standard prices calculated for AFA cost recovery per § 679.66(b).

      (c) —(1)  The trawl EM fee percentage is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. These amounts will be announced by publication in the  in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

      (2)  Each year NMFS will calculate and publish the trawl EM fee percentage for the full coverage trawl EM category catcher vessels according to the following factors and methodology:

      (i)  NMFS will use the following factors to determine the fee percentages:

      (A) The catch to which the full coverage trawl EM fee will apply;

      (B) The ex-vessel value of that catch; and

      (C) The costs directly related to the EM data collection, EM data review, VMP approval, and trawl EM category data.

      (ii)  NMFS will use the following equations to determine the trawl EM fee percentage: 100 ×  ÷  where:

      (A)  equals the trawl EM category costs for the directed full coverage pollock fisheries for the most recent fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) with any adjustments to the account from payments received in the previous year.

      (B)  equals the total of the standard ex-vessel value of the catch subject to the trawl EM fee liability for the current year.

      (iii)  Trawl EM category costs will be calculated only for catcher vessels that NMFS approves to be in the full coverage trawl EM category.

      (3) —(i)  NMFS will calculate and announce the trawl EM fee percentage in a  notice by December 1 of the year following the year in which the full coverage pollock landings were made. NMFS will calculate the trawl EM fee percentage based on the calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  NMFS will apply the calculated trawl EM fee percentage to all full coverage trawl EM category directed pollock landings made by vessels in the trawl EM category between January 1 and December 31 of the previous year.

      (4)  A designated representative must use the AFA fee percentage applicable at the time a Bering Sea directed pollock landing is debited from an AFA pollock fishery allocation to calculate the AFA fee liability for any retroactive payments for that landing.

Service on or notice to the cooperative's appointed agent constitutes service on or notice to all members of the cooperative.

      (3)  The agent for service of process must be capable of accepting service on behalf of the cooperative until December 31 of the year 5 years after the calendar year for which the fishery cooperative has filed its intent to operate. The owners and operators of all member vessels of a cooperative are responsible for ensuring that a substitute agent is designated and the Agency is notified of the name, address and telephone number of the substitute agent in the event the previously designated agent is no longer capable of accepting service on behalf of the cooperative or the cooperative members within that 5-year period.

      (d)  You must file on an annual basis, with the Council and NMFS, a signed copy of your fishery cooperative contract, and any material modifications to any such contract, together with a copy of a letter from a party to the contract requesting a business review letter on the fishery cooperative from the Department of Justice and any response to such request. The Council and NMFS will make this information available to the public upon request.

      (1)  If your cooperative contract was previously filed with NMFS and the Council under this paragraph (d), then you may submit a renewal letter to NMFS and the Council by the filing deadline in lieu of the cooperative contract and business review letter. The renewal letter must provide notice that the previously filed cooperative contract will remain in effect for the subsequent fishing year. The renewal letter also must detail any material modifications to the cooperative contract that have been made since the last filing including, but not limited to, any changes in cooperative membership.

      (2)  You must send a signed copy of your cooperative contract or renewal letter and the required supporting materials to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, 605 West 4th Ave, Suite 306, Anchorage, AK 99501; and to the NMFS Alaska Region. The mailing address for the NMFS Alaska Region is P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802. The street address for delivery by private courier is 709 West 9th St., Suite 401, Juneau, AK 99801.

      (3)  The contract or renewal letter and supporting materials must be received by NMFS and by the Council at least 30 days prior to the start of any fishing activity conducted under the terms of the contract. In addition, an inshore cooperative that is also applying for an allocation of BS subarea pollock under § 679.62 must file its contract, any amendments hereto, and supporting materials no later than December 1 of the year prior to the year in which fishing under the contract will occur.

      (e) —(1)  Any cooperative contract filed under this paragraph (e) must:

      (i) List parties to the contract.

      (v) Include a contract clause under which the parties to the contract agree to make payments to the State of Alaska for any pollock harvested in the directed pollock fishery that are not landed in the State of Alaska, in amounts which would otherwise accrue had the pollock been landed in the State of Alaska subject to any landing taxes established under Alaska law. Failure to include such a contract clause or for such amounts to be paid will result in a revocation of the authority to form fishery cooperatives under section 1 of the Act of June 25, 1934 (15 U.S.C. 521 ).

      (vi) List the obligations of members of a cooperative, governed by this section, to ensure the full payment of all AFA fee liabilities that may be due.

      (2)  A cooperative contract that includes catcher vessels must include adequate provisions to prevent each non-exempt member catcher vessel from exceeding an individual vessel sideboard limit for each BSAI or GOA sideboard species or species group that is issued to the vessel by the cooperative in accordance with the following formula:

      (i) The aggregate individual vessel sideboard limits issued to all member vessels in a cooperative must not exceed the aggregate contributions of each member vessel towards the overall groundfish sideboard amount as calculated by NMFS under § 679.64(b) and as announced to the cooperative by the Regional Administrator, or

      (ii) In the case of two or more cooperatives that have entered into an inter-cooperative agreement, the aggregate individual vessel sideboard limits issued to all member vessels subject to the inter-cooperative agreement must not exceed the aggregate contributions of each member vessel towards the overall groundfish sideboard amount as calculated by NMFS under § 679.64(b) and as announced by the Regional Administrator.

      (f)  Any fishery cooperative governed by this section must submit an annual written report on fishing activity to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, 605 West 4th Avenue, Suite 306, Anchorage, AK 99501. The Council will make copies of each report available to the public upon request.

      § 679.62   Inshore sector cooperative allocation program.

#### § § 679.62

      (a)  An inshore catcher vessel cooperative that applies for and receives an AFA inshore cooperative fishing permit under § 679.4(l)(6) will receive a sub-allocation of the annual BS subarea inshore sector directed fishing allowance. Each inshore cooperative's annual allocation amount(s) will be determined using the following procedure:

      (1)  The Regional Administrator will calculate an official AFA inshore cooperative catch history for every inshore-sector endorsed AFA catcher vessel according to the following steps:

      (i)  For each year from 1995 through 1997 the Regional Administrator will determine each vessel's total non-CDQ inshore pollock landings from the Bering Sea Subarea and Aleutian Islands Subarea separately, except for the F/V PROVIDIAN (USCG documentation number 1062183).

      (ii)  For the F/V PROVIDIAN, pursuant to Public Law 106-562, the Regional Administrator will substitute the 1992 through 1994 total Bering Sea subarea and Aleutian Islands subarea pollock non-CDQ inshore landings made by the F/V OCEAN SPRAY (USCG documentation number 517100 for the purpose of determining annual cooperative quota share percentage.

      (iii)  If a catcher vessel made a total of 500 or more mt of landings of non-CDQ Bering Sea Subarea pollock or Aleutian Islands Subarea pollock to catcher/processors or offshore motherships other than the EXCELLENCE (USCG documentation number 967502); GOLDEN ALASKA (USCG documentation number 651041); or OCEAN PHOENIX (USCG documentation number 296779) over the 3-year period from 1995 through 1997, then all non-CDQ offshore pollock landings made by that vessel during from 1995 through 1997 will be added to the vessel's inshore catch history by year and subarea.

      (iv)  After steps (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are completed, the 2 years with the highest landings will be selected for each subarea and added together to generate the vessel's official AFA inshore cooperative catch history for each subarea. A vessel's best 2 years may be different for the Bering Sea subarea and the Aleutian Islands Subarea.

      (2)  (i) If NMFS approves the application of an owner of a catcher vessel that is a member of an inshore vessel cooperative to replace a catcher vessel pursuant to § 679.4(l)(7), NMFS will assign the AFA inshore pollock catch history of the replaced vessel to the replacement vessel.

      (ii) If NMFS approves the application of an owner of a catcher vessel that is a member of an inshore vessel cooperative to remove a catcher vessel from the AFA directed pollock fishery pursuant to § 679.4(l)(7), NMFS will assign the AFA inshore pollock catch history of the removed vessel to one or more vessels in the inshore vessel cooperative to which the removed vessel belonged as required by § 679.4(l)(7); NMFS will not assign the catch history for any non-pollock species of the removed vessel to any other vessel, and NMFS will permanently extinguish any exemptions from sideboards that were specified on the AFA permit of the removed vessel.

      (3)  Each inshore pollock cooperative that applies for and receives an AFA inshore pollock cooperative fishing permit will receive an annual quota share percentage of pollock for the BS subarea that is equal to the sum of each member vessel's official AFA inshore cooperative catch history for the BS subarea divided by the sum of the official AFA inshore cooperative catch histories of all inshore-sector endorsed AFA catcher vessels. The cooperative's quota share percentage will be listed on the cooperative's AFA pollock cooperative permit.

      (4)  (Effective April 1, 2005) Each inshore pollock cooperative that receives a quota share percentage for a fishing year will receive an annual allocation of Bering Sea and/or Aleutian Islands pollock that is equal to the cooperative's quota share percentage for that subarea multiplied by the annual inshore pollock allocation for that subarea. Each cooperative's annual pollock TAC allocation may be published in the proposed and final BSAI harvest specifications notice.

      (b)  A cooperative that receives a cooperative fishing permit under § 679.4(l)(6) must comply with all of the fishing restrictions set out in this subpart. The owners and operators of all the member vessels that are named on an inshore cooperative fishing permit and the owners and operators of any vessels under contract to the cooperative under paragraph (c) of this section are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with all of the requirements of a cooperative fishing permit pursuant to § 679.4(l)(6).

      (1)  Only catcher vessels listed on a cooperative's AFA inshore cooperative fishing permit or vessels under contract to the cooperative under paragraph (c) of this section are permitted to harvest any portion of an inshore cooperative's annual pollock allocation.

      (2)  The following catches will accrue against a cooperative's annual pollock allocation regardless of whether the pollock was retained or discarded:

      (i)  All pollock caught by a member vessel while engaged in directed fishing for pollock in the BS subarea unless the vessel is under contract to another cooperative and the pollock is assigned to another cooperative.

      (ii)  All pollock contracted for harvest and caught by a vessel under contract to the cooperative under paragraph (c) of this section while the vessel was engaged in directed fishing for pollock in the BS subarea.

      (c)  A cooperative that wishes to contract with a non-member vessel to harvest a portion of the cooperative's annual pollock allocation must comply with the following procedures.

      (1)  A cooperative that wishes to contract with a non-member vessel must submit a completed contract fishing application to the Alaska Region, NMFS, in accordance with the contract fishing application instructions.

      (2)  The following information must be included on a contract fishing application:

      (i)  The names of the cooperative or cooperatives that wish to contract with a non-member vessel.

      (ii)  The names and signatures of the designated representatives for the cooperatives that wish to contract with a non-member vessel and the vessel's home cooperative.

      (iii)  The name and AFA permit number of the contracted vessel.

      (iv)  The name and signature of the owner of the contracted vessel.

      (v)  A completed harvest schedule showing how all catch and any overages by the contracted vessel will be allocated between the contracting cooperative (or cooperatives) and the contract vessel's home cooperative. In the event that multiple cooperatives are jointly contracting with a non-member vessel, the harvest schedule must clearly specify how all catch and any overages will be allocated among the various cooperatives.

      (3)  Only AFA catcher vessels with an inshore fishing endorsement that are members of an inshore cooperative may conduct contract fishing on behalf of another inshore cooperative.

      (4)  A cooperative that has contracted with a non-member vessel to harvest a portion of its inshore pollock allocation must inform any AFA inshore processors to whom the vessel will deliver pollock while under contract to the cooperative prior to the start of fishing under the contract.

      (5)  An AFA inshore processor that receives pollock harvested by a vessel under contract to a cooperative must report the delivery to NMFS on the electronic delivery report by using the co-op code for the contracting cooperative rather than the co-op code of the vessel's home cooperative.

      § 679.63   Catch weighing requirements for vessels and processors.

#### § § 679.63

      (a) —(1)  All groundfish landed by listed AFA catcher/processors or received by AFA motherships must be weighed on a NMFS-certified scale and made available for sampling by a NMFS certified observer. The owner and operator of a listed AFA catcher/processor or an AFA mothership must ensure that the vessel is in compliance with the scale requirements described at § 679.28(b), that each groundfish haul is weighed separately, and that no sorting of catch, except halibut sorted on deck by vessels participating in the halibut deck sorting described at § 679.102, takes place prior to weighing.

      (2)  The owner and operator of a listed AFA catcher/processor or AFA mothership must provide an observer sampling station as described at § 679.28(d) and must ensure that the vessel operator complies with the observer sampling station requirements described at § 679.28(d) at all times that the vessel harvests groundfish or receives deliveries of groundfish harvested in the BSAI or GOA.

      (b)  The owner or operator of an unlisted AFA catcher/processor must comply with the catch weighing and observer sampling station requirements set out in paragraph (a) of this section at all times the vessel is engaged in directed fishing for pollock in the BSAI.

      (c)  The owner and operator of an AFA replacement vessel are subject to the catch weighing requirements and the observer sampling station requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that applied to the owner and operator of the replaced vessel.

      (d) —(1)  All groundfish landed by AFA catcher vessels engaged in directed fishing for pollock in the BSAI must be sorted and weighed on a scale approved by the State of Alaska as described in § 679.28(c), and be made available for sampling by a NMFS certified observer. The observer must be allowed to test any scale used to weigh groundfish in order to determine its accuracy.

      (2) The plant manager or plant liaison must notify the observer of the offloading schedule for each delivery of BSAI pollock by an AFA catcher vessel at least 1 hour prior to offloading. An observer must monitor each delivery of BSAI pollock from an AFA catcher vessel and be on site the entire time the delivery is being weighed or sorted.

      § 679.64   Harvesting sideboard limits in other fisheries.

#### § § 679.64

      (a)  The Regional Administrator will restrict the ability of listed AFA catcher/processors and a catcher/processor designated on a listed AFA catcher/processor permit to engage in directed fishing for non-pollock groundfish species to protect participants in other groundfish fisheries from adverse effects resulting from the AFA and from fishery cooperatives in the BS subarea directed pollock fishery.

      (1)  Except for Aleutian Islands pollock and BSAI Pacific cod, the Regional Administrator will establish annual AFA catcher/processor harvest limits for each groundfish species or species group in which a TAC is specified for an area or subarea of the BSAI as follows:

      (i)  (A) The Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch harvest limit will be equal to the 1996 through 1997 aggregate retained catch of Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch by catcher/processors listed in Sections 208(e)(1) through (20) and 209 of the AFA in non-pollock target fisheries divided by the sum of the Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch catch in 1996 and 1997 multiplied by the remainder of the Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch TAC after the subtraction of the CDQ reserve under § 679.20(b)(1)(ii)(C) in the year in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (B) If the amount of Pacific ocean perch calculated under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section is determined by the Regional Administrator to be insufficient to meet bycatch needs of AFA catcher/processors in other directed fisheries for groundfish, the Regional Administrator will prohibit directed fishing for Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch by AFA catcher/processors and establish the sideboard amount equal to the amount of Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch caught by AFA catcher/processors incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species.

      (ii)  The Atka mackerel harvest limit for each area and season will be equal to:

      (A) Bering Sea subarea and Eastern Aleutian Islands, zero; and

      (B) Western Aleutian Islands, 20 percent of the annual TAC specified for Atka mackerel.

      (iii)  The harvest limit for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole will be equal to the 1995 through 1997 aggregate retained catch of that species by catcher/processors listed in Sections 208(e)(1) through (e)(20) and 209 of the AFA in non-pollock target fisheries divided by the sum of the catch of that species in 1995 through 1997 multiplied by the remainder of the TAC of that species after the subtraction of the CDQ reserve under § 679.20(b)(1)(ii)(C) in the year in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (iv)  (A) Except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the harvest limit for each BSAI groundfish species or species group will be equal to the 1995 through 1997 aggregate retained catch of that species by catcher/processors listed in Sections 208 (e)(1) through (e)(20) and 209 of the AFA in non-pollock target fisheries divided by the sum of the catch of that species in 1995 through 1997 multiplied by the TAC of that species available for harvest by catcher/processors in the year in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (B) If the amount of a species calculated under paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section is determined by the Regional Administrator to be insufficient to meet bycatch needs for AFA catcher/processors in other directed fisheries for groundfish, the Regional Administrator will prohibit directed fishing for that species by AFA catcher/processors and establish the sideboard amount equal to the amount of that species caught by AFA catcher/processors incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species.

      (v)  AFA catcher/processors will not be subject to a harvest limit for yellowfin sole in the BSAI during a calendar year if the aggregate ITAC of yellowfin sole assigned to the Amendment 80 sector and BSAI trawl limited access sector is greater than or equal to 125,000 metric tons.

      (2)  The halibut and crab PSC bycatch limits specified for catcher/processors in the BSAI are listed in Tables 40 and 41 to this part.

      (3)  (i) The Regional Administrator will manage groundfish harvest limits and PSC bycatch limits for AFA catcher/processors through directed fishing closures in fisheries established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in accordance with the procedures set out in §§ 679.20(d)(1)(iv) and 679.21(b)(4)(iii).

      (ii) Directed fishing for the BSAI groundfish that have sideboard limits listed in Table 54 of this part is prohibited.

      (b)  The Regional Administrator will restrict the ability of AFA catcher vessels to engage in directed fishing for other groundfish species to protect participants in other groundfish fisheries from adverse effects resulting from the AFA and from fishery cooperatives in the BS subarea directed pollock fishery.

      (1)  Catcher vessel harvest limits and PSC bycatch limits apply to all AFA catcher vessels participating in all GOA groundfish fisheries and all non-pollock groundfish fisheries in the BSAI except vessels qualifying for sideboard exemptions in the specific fisheries identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2)  (i) BSAI Pacific cod sideboard exemptions—(A) AFA catcher vessels less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that are determined by the Regional Administrator to have harvested a combined total of less than 5,100 mt of BSAI pollock, and to have made 30 or more legal landings of Pacific cod in the BSAI directed fishery for Pacific cod from 1995 through 1997 are exempt from sideboard closures for BSAI Pacific cod.

      (B) AFA catcher vessels with mothership endorsements are exempt from BSAI Pacific cod catcher vessel sideboard directed fishing closures after March 1 of each fishing year.

      (ii)  AFA catcher vessels less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that are determined by the Regional Administrator to have harvested less than 5,100 mt of BSAI pollock and to have made 40 or more landings of GOA groundfish from 1995 through 1997 are exempt from GOA groundfish catcher vessel sideboard directed fishing closures.

      (iii) An AFA rebuilt catcher vessel will have the same sideboard exemptions, if any, as the vessel before rebuilding, irrespective of the length of the AFA rebuilt catcher vessel.

      (iv) An AFA replacement vessel for an AFA catcher vessel will have the same sideboard exemptions, if any, as the replaced AFA catcher vessel, irrespective of the length of the AFA replacement vessel, except that if the replacement vessel was already designated on an AFA permit as exempt from sideboard limits, the replacement vessel will maintain the exemption even if the replaced vessel was not exempt from sideboard limits.

      (3)  Except for Aleutian Islands pollock, the Regional Administrator will establish annual AFA catcher vessel harvest limits for each groundfish species or species group in which a TAC is specified for an area or subarea of the GOA and BSAI as follows:

      (i)  The AFA catcher vessel groundfish harvest limit for each BSAI groundfish species or species group other than BSAI Pacific cod will be equal to the aggregate retained catch of that groundfish species or species group from 1995 through 1997 by all AFA catcher vessels; divided by the sum of the TACs available to catcher vessels for that species or species group from 1995 through 1997; multiplied by the TAC available to catcher vessels in the year or season in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (ii)  The AFA catcher vessel groundfish harvest limit for BSAI Pacific cod will be equal to the retained catch of BSAI Pacific cod in 1997 by AFA catcher vessels not exempted under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section divided by the BSAI Pacific cod TAC available to catcher vessels in 1997; multiplied by the BSAI Pacific cod TAC available to catcher vessels in the year or season in which the harvest limit will be in effect. This limit is in effect only for C season.

      (iii)  The AFA catcher vessel groundfish harvest limit for each Amendment 80 species other than BSAI Pacific cod will be equal to the aggregate retained catch of that Amendment 80 species from 1995 through 1997 by all AFA catcher vessels, divided by the sum of the TAC available to catcher vessels for that species or species group from 1995 through 1997, and multiplied by the remainder of the TAC after the subtraction of the CDQ reserve under § 679.20(b)(1)(ii)(C) in the year or season in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (iv)  The non-exempt AFA catcher vessels and the associated LLP licenses groundfish harvest limit for each GOA groundfish species or species group will be equal to the aggregate retained catch of that groundfish species or species group from 2009 through 2019 by AFA catcher vessels not exempted under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; divided by the sum of the TACs of that species or species group available to catcher vessels from 2009 through 2019; multiplied by the TAC available to catcher vessels in the year or season in which the harvest limit will be in effect.

      (4) —(i) [Reserved]

      (ii) The non-exempt AFA catcher vessels and the associated LLP licenses PSC bycatch limit for halibut in the GOA will be an annual amount based on a static ratio of 0.072 derived from the aggregate retained groundfish catch by non-exempt AFA CVs in each PSC target category from 2009 through 2019.

      (5)  (i) The Regional Administrator will manage groundfish harvest limits and PSC bycatch limits for AFA catcher vessels using directed fishing closures according to the procedures set out at §§ 679.20(d)(1)(iv) and 679.21(d)(7) and (e)(3)(v).

      (ii) Directed fishing for the BSAI groundfish that have sideboard limits listed in Table 55 of this part and the GOA groundfish that have sideboard limits listed in Table 56 of this part is prohibited.

      (6)  AFA catcher vessels will not be subject to a harvest limit for yellowfin sole in the BSAI during a calendar year if the aggregate ITAC of yellowfin sole assigned to the Amendment 80 sector and BSAI trawl limited access sector is greater than or equal to 125,000 metric tons.

      (iii) The person designated as the representative of the AFA mothership cooperative at the time of a Bering Sea pollock landing.

      (2)  (i) Subsequent transfer of AFA permits held by cooperative members does not affect the designated representative's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (ii) Changes in the membership in a cooperative, such as members joining or departing during the relevant year, or changes in the holdings of AFA permits of those members do not affect the designated representative's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (3)  Each designated representative (as identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) is responsible for submitting the cost recovery payment for all Bering Sea pollock landings debited against the AFA cooperative's or AFA sector's AFA pollock fishery allocation.

      (4) —(i)  The designated representative (as identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) must submit all AFA fee payment(s) to NMFS at the address provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the Bering Sea pollock landings were made.

      (ii)  Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.

      (iii)  Submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form.

      (b) —(1)  A designated representative must use the AFA standard price determined by NMFS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  Each year the Regional Administrator will publish the _AFA standard price_ in the  by December 1 of the year in which the landings were made. The AFA standard price will be described in U.S. dollars per AFA pollock equivalent pound for Bering Sea pollock landings made by AFA cooperative or AFA sector members during the current calendar year.

      (ii)  The AFA standard price published by NMFS shall apply to all Bering Sea pollock landings made by an AFA cooperative or AFA sector member during the current calendar year.

      (iii)  NMFS will calculate the AFA standard price to reflect, as closely as possible, the standard price of Bering Sea pollock landings based on information provided in the COAR for the previous year, as described in § 679.5(p). The Regional Administrator will base the AFA standard price on the following information:

      (A) Landed pounds of Bering Sea pollock;

      (ii)  NMFS will apply the calculated AFA fee percentages to all Bering Sea directed pollock landings made between January 1 and December 31 of the current year.

      (4)  A designated representative must use the AFA fee percentage applicable at the time a Bering Sea directed pollock landing is debited from an AFA pollock fishery allocation to calculate the AFA fee liability for any retroactive payments for that landing.

      (5)  (i) Each AFA inshore cooperative, the AFA mothership cooperative, and the AFA catcher/processor sector will be subject to an AFA fee liability for any Bering Sea pollock debited from its AFA pollock fishery allocation during a calendar year.

      (ii) The AFA fee liability assessed to an AFA inshore cooperative will be based on the proportion of the AFA fee liability of Bering Sea pollock debited from that AFA inshore cooperative's AFA pollock fishery allocation relative to all AFA inshore cooperatives during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (iii) The AFA fee liability assessed to the AFA catcher/processor sector will be based on the standard ex-vessel value of Bering Sea pollock debited from the sector's AFA pollock fishery allocation during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (iv) The AFA fee liability assessed to the AFA mothership cooperative will be based on the proportion of the standard ex-vessel value of Bering Sea pollock debited from the cooperative's AFA pollock fishery allocation during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (v) NMFS will provide a fee liability summary letter to each designated representative by December 1 of each year. The summary will explain the AFA fee liability determination including the current fee percentage and details of Bering Sea pollock pounds debited from the AFA pollock fishery allocation by permit, species, date, and prices.

      (d) —(1) No AFA inshore cooperative will receive its AFA pollock fishery allocation until the cooperative's designated representative submits full payment of the cooperative's AFA fee liability.

      (2) The AFA mothership cooperative will not receive its AFA pollock fishery allocation until the cooperative's designated representative submits full payment of that cooperative's AFA fee liability.

      (3) The AFA catcher/processor sector will not receive its Bering Sea pollock allocation until the entity's designated representative defined at § 679.21(f)(8)(i)(C) submits full payment of the AFA fee liability at the time of a Bering Sea pollock landing, except the Regional Administrator may release to the AFA catcher/processor sector a portion of the AFA catcher/processor sector's Bering Sea pollock allocation that is equal to the portion of the fee liability submitted by the entity's designated representative.

      (4) If the designated representative fails to submit full payment for the AFA fee liability by the date described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Regional Administrator, at any time thereafter, may send an IAD to the designated representative stating that the estimated fee liability, based on the information submitted by the designated representative, is the AFA fee liability due from the designated representative.

      (5) If the designated representative fails to submit full payment for the AFA fee liability by the date described at paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Regional Administrator will not issue a Bering Sea pollock allocation to that AFA cooperative or AFA sector for the following calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

      (6) Upon final agency action determining that the designated representative has not submitted the AFA fee liability payment, the Regional Administrator may continue to not issue a Bering Sea pollock allocation for that AFA cooperative or AFA sector for any subsequent calendar years until NMFS receives the unpaid fees. If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.

      (e)  Upon issuance of final agency action, payment submitted to NMFS in excess of the AFA fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the designated representative unless the designated representative requests the agency to credit the excess amount against a cooperative's or sector's future AFA fee liability.

      (f)  The designated representative who receives an IAD for incomplete payment of an AFA fee liability may appeal under the appeals procedures set out at 15 CFR part 906.

      (g)  Each year, NMFS will publish a report describing the AFA Cost Recovery Fee Program.

An applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, will be provided a single 30-day evidentiary period to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the Rockfish Program official record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the Rockfish Program official record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct. Any claims that remain inconsistent or that are not accepted after the 30-day evidentiary period will be denied, and the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination (IAD) of his or her appeal rights under § 679.43.

      (6)  If an applicant is notified by an IAD that claims made by the applicant have been denied, that applicant may appeal that IAD under the provisions in § 679.43.

      (e) —(1)  The Regional Administrator will assign rockfish QS only to a person who submits a timely application for rockfish QS that is approved by NMFS based on:

      (i) The amount of rockfish legal landings assigned to an LLP license as established in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or

      (ii) The number of years during which a person made a rockfish legal landing to an entry level processor under the authority of an LLP license in the entry level trawl fishery during 2007, 2008, or 2009 as established in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (2)  Based on the Rockfish Program official record, the Regional Administrator shall determine the initial allocation of rockfish QS for each rockfish primary species assigned to each LLP license indicated on a timely and complete Application for Rockfish QS that is approved by NMFS, and that qualifies for an allocation of QS based on rockfish legal landings from 2000 to 2006 (and that is not assigned rockfish QS under the entry level trawl fishery transition allocation under the provisions in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), according to the following procedure:

      (i) Sum the rockfish legal landings for each rockfish primary species “s” for each eligible LLP license “l” for each year during the fishery seasons established in Table 28a to this part. For purposes of this calculation, the Regional Administrator will not assign any amount of rockfish legal landings to an LLP license that is assigned rockfish QS under the provisions in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. This yields the Rockfish Total Catch for each rockfish primary species for each year.

      (ii) For each rockfish primary species, sum the highest 5 years of Rockfish Total Catch for each eligible LLP license described under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. This yields the Highest 5 Years This amount is equal to the number of rockfish QS units for that LLP license for that rockfish primary species.

      (iii) Sum the Highe*s*t 5 Years in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section of all eligible LLP licenses for each rockfish primary species. The result is the ∑Highest 5 Years (or All Highest 5 Years).

      (3)  Based on the Rockfish Program official record, the Regional Administrator shall determine the initial allocation of rockfish QS for each rockfish primary species assigned to each LLP license indicated on a timely and complete Application for Rockfish QS that is approved by NMFS, that qualifies for an allocation of QS based on rockfish legal landings from 2007, 2008, or 2009 under the entry level trawl fishery transition allocation (and that is not assigned rockfish QS under the provisions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section), according to the following procedure:

      (i) Assign one Rockfish Landing Unit to an LLP *l*icense for each year a rockfish legal landing of any rockfish primary species was made to an entry level processor under the authority of an LLP license during the season dates for the entry level trawl fishery in 2007, 2008, or 2009 as established in Table 28b to this part. This yields the Rockfish Landing Units. For purposes of this calculation, the Regional Administrator will not assign any Rockfish Landing Units to an LLP license that is assigned rockfish QS under the provisions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

      (ii) Sum the Rockfish Landing Units of all eligible LLP licenses.

      (iii) Divide the Rockfish Landing Units in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for an LLP ***l***icense by the sum of all Rockfish Landing Units of all eligible LLP licenses in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. The result is the Percentage of the Total Entry Level Trawl Fishery Transition Rockfish QS Pool as presented in the following equation:

      (iv) Determine the Total Entry Level Trawl Fishery Transition Rockfish QS pool for each rockfish primary species “s” as presented in the following equation:

      (v) Multiply the Percentage of the Total Entry Level Trawl Fishery Transition Rockfish QS pool for each LLP license, as calculated in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, by the Total Entry Level Trawl Fishery Transition Rockfish QS pool for each rockfish primary species, as calculated in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. This yields the number of rockfish QS units for that LLP license for that rockfish primary species.

      (vi) All rockfish QS units calculated in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section are assigned to the catcher vessel sector.

      (4)  The rockfish initial QS pool for each rockfish primary species, and for each sector, is equal to the sum of all QS units assigned to LLP licenses, and in each sector, as calculated under paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section as of February 14, 2012.

      (5)  Rockfish QS assigned to an LLP license is non-severable from that LLP license, except as provided for under § 679.80(f)(2).

      (f) —(1)  A person may transfer an LLP license, and any rockfish QS assigned to that LLP license under the provisions in § 679.4(k)(7), provided that the LLP license is not assigned rockfish QS in excess of the use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2) at the time of transfer.

      (2)  (i) If an LLP license is assigned an initial allocation of aggregate rockfish QS that exceeds a use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2), the LLP license holder may transfer rockfish QS in excess of the use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2) separate from that LLP license and assign it to one or more LLP licenses. However, a transfer may not be approved by NMFS if that transfer would cause the receiving LLP license to exceed a use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2).

      (ii) Prior to the transfer of an LLP license that is assigned an initial allocation of aggregate rockfish QS that exceeds a use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2), the LLP license holder must transfer the rockfish QS that is in excess of the use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2), separate from that LLP license, and assign it to one or more LLP licenses under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. On completion of the transfer of QS, the LLP license that was initially allocated an amount of aggregate rockfish QS in excess of the use cap may not exceed the use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2).

      (iii) Any rockfish QS associated with the LLP license that is in excess of the use cap may be transferred only if Block C of the Application for Transfer License Limitation Program Groundfish/Crab License is filled out entirely.

      (iv) Rockfish QS may only be transferred to an LLP license that has been assigned rockfish QS with the same sector designation as the rockfish QS to be transferred.

      (v) Rockfish QS that is transferred from an LLP license that was initially allocated an amount of aggregate rockfish QS in excess of the use cap specified in § 679.82(a)(2) and assigned to another LLP license may not be severed from the receiving LLP license.

      § 679.81   Rockfish Program annual harvester privileges.

#### § § 679.81

      (a) —(1)  Each calendar year, the Regional Administrator will determine the tonnage of rockfish primary species that will be assigned to participants in a rockfish cooperative. This amount will be assigned to rockfish cooperatives as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (2)  (i) The amount of rockfi*s*h primary species “s” allocated to the Rockfish Program is calculated by deducting the incidental catch allowance the Regional Administrator determines is required on an annual basis in other non-target fisheries from the TAC. The remaining TAC for that rockfish primary species (TAC) is assigned for use by the rockfish entry level longline fishery and rockfish cooperatives.

      (ii) The allocation of TAC for each rockfi*s*h primary species to the rockfish entry level longline fishery is established in Table 28e to this part.

      (iii) The allocation of TAC to rockfi**s**h cooperatives is equal to the amount remaining after allocation to the rockfish entry level longline fishery (cooperative TAC).

      (b) —(1)   Cooperative TAC a***s***signed for a rockfish primary species will be divided between the catcher/processor sector and the catcher vessel sector. Each sector will receive a percentage of cooperative TAC for each rockfish primary species equal to the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to all LLP licenses that receive rockfish QS in that sector divided by the rockfish QS pool for that rockfish primary species. Expressed algebraically for each rockfish primary species “s” in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

      (i) Catcher/Proce****s****sor Sector TAC = [(Cooperative TAC) × (Rockfish QS Units in the Catcher/Processor Sector/Rockfish QS Pool)].

      (ii) Catcher Ve****s****sel Sector TAC = [(Cooperative TAC) × (Rockfish QS Units in the Catcher Vessel Sector/Rockfish QS Pool)].

      (2)  TAC is assigned to each rockfish cooperative based on the rockfish QS assigned to that fishery in each sector according to the following procedures:

      (i)  The amount of TAC for each rockfi**s**h primary species assigned to a catcher vessel rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of rockfish QS units assigned to that rockfish cooperative divided by the total rockfish QS assigned to rockfish cooperatives in the catcher vessel sector multiplied by the catcher vessel TAC Once TAC for a rockfish primary species is assigned to a catcher vessel rockfish cooperative, it is issued as CQ specific to that rockfish cooperative. The amount of CQ for each rockfish primary species that is assigned to a rockfish cooperative is expressed algebraically as follows:

      (ii)  The amount of TAC for each rockfi*s*h primary species assigned to a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of rockfish QS units assigned to that rockfish cooperative divided by the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to rockfish cooperatives in the catcher/processor sector multiplied by the catcher/processor TAC Once TAC for a rockfish primary species is assigned to a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative, it is issued as CQ specific to that rockfish cooperative.

      The amount of CQ for each rockfish primary species that is assigned to a rockfish cooperative is expressed algebraically as follows:

      (c) —(1)  Each calendar year, the Regional Administrator will determine the tonnage of rockfish secondary species that may be assigned to the rockfish cooperatives as rockfish CQ. This amount will be assigned to the rockfish cooperatives in the catcher/processor sector and the catcher vessel sector.

      (2)  The amount of rockfish secondary species tonnage that may be assigned to the catcher/processor sector and the catcher vessel sector is specified in Table 28c to this part.

      (3)  Rockfish secondary species will be assigned only to rockfish cooperatives.

      (4)  The amount of CQ for each rockfish secondary species that is assigned to each rockfish cooperative is determined according to the following procedures:

      (i)  The CQ for a rockfish secondary species that is assigned to a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of that rockfish secondary species allocated to the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program as specified in Table 28c to this part, multiplied by the sum of the rockfish QS units for all rockfish primary species assigned to that catcher/processor rockfish cooperative divided by the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to rockfish cooperatives for all rockfish primary species in the catcher/processor sector. Expressed algebraically in the following equation:

      (ii)  The CQ for a rockfish secondary species that is assigned to a catcher vessel rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of that rockfish secondary species allocated to the catcher vessel sector in the Rockfish Program as specified in Table 28c to this part, multiplied by the sum of the rockfish QS units for all rockfish primary species assigned to that catcher vessel rockfish cooperative divided by the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to rockfish cooperatives for all rockfish primary species in the catcher vessel sector. Expressed algebraically in the following equation:

      (d) —(1)  Each calendar year, the Regional Administrator will determine the tonnage of rockfish halibut PSC that will be assigned to the Rockfish Program. This amount will be allocated appropriately to the catcher/processor sector and the catcher vessel sector. The tonnage of rockfish halibut PSC assigned to a sector will be further assigned as CQ only to rockfish cooperative(s) within that sector.

      (2)  (i) The amount of halibut PSC that may be assigned to the catcher vessel and catcher/processor sectors is specified in Table 28d to this part.

      (ii) The amount of halibut PSC that is not assigned to the catcher vessel and catcher/processor sectors as specified in Table 28d to this part will not be assigned for use as halibut PSC or as halibut IFQ.

      (3)  (i) Rockfish halibut PSC assigned to a sector will be assigned only to rockfish cooperatives within that sector.

      (ii) Rockfish halibut PSC specified in Table 28d is not assigned to rockfish opt-out vessels.

      (iii) Rockfish halibut PSC specified in Table 28d is not assigned to the rockfish entry level longline fishery.

      (4)  The amount of rockfish halibut PSC CQ that is assigned to each rockfish cooperative is determined according to the following procedures:

      (i)  The CQ for halibut PSC that is assigned to a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of halibut PSC allocated to the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program as specified in Table 28d to this part, multiplied by the sum of the rockfish QS units for all rockfish primary species assigned to that catcher/processor rockfish cooperative divided by the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to rockfish cooperatives for all rockfish primary species in the catcher/processor sector. This is expressed algebraically in the following equation:

      (ii)  The CQ for halibut PSC that is assigned to a catcher vessel rockfish cooperative is equal to the amount of halibut PSC allocated to the catcher vessel sector in the Rockfish Program as specified in Table 28d to this part, multiplied by the sum of the rockfish QS units for all rockfish primary species assigned to that catcher vessel rockfish cooperative divided by the sum of the rockfish QS units assigned to rockfish cooperatives for all rockfish primary species in the catcher vessel sector. This is expressed algebraically in the following equation:

      (e) —(1)  Each calendar year, a person that is participating in the Rockfish Program may assign an LLP license and the rockfish QS assigned to that LLP license to a Rockfish cooperative. A rockfish eligible harvester assigns rockfish QS to a rockfish cooperative on a complete application for CQ that is approved by NMFS and that meets the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.

      (i) An LLP license and rockfish QS may be assigned to a catcher vessel cooperative if that rockfish QS is derived from legal rockfish landings assigned to the catcher vessel sector.

      (ii) An LLP license and rockfish QS may be assigned to a catcher/processor cooperative if that rockfish QS is derived from rockfish legal landings assigned to the catcher/processor sector.

      (2)  Each calendar year, a person holding an LLP license assigned rockfish QS in the catcher/processor sector may opt-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative. NMFS will presume a person has opted-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative if that person and LLP license with rockfish QS is not named on a timely submitted Annual Application for Cooperative Fishing Quota. A person may not assign an LLP license assigned rockfish QS in the catcher/processor sector to both a rockfish cooperative and opt-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative.

      (f) —(1)  If a designated rockfish cooperative representative submits a complete and timely application that is approved by NMFS, the cooperative will receive a CQ permit. The CQ permit will list the amount of CQ, by rockfish primary species, rockfish secondary species, and halibut PSC held by the rockfish cooperative, the members of the rockfish cooperative, LLP licenses assigned to that rockfish cooperative, and the vessels that are authorized to harvest fish under that CQ permit. This application may only be submitted to NMFS using the methods described on the application.

      (2)  Application forms are available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  or by contacting NMFS at (800) 304-4846, Option 2.

      (3)  (i) A completed application must be received by NMFS no later than 1700 hours, A.l.t., on March 15, 2012, for the first year of the program and March 1 for all subsequent years, or if sent by U.S. mail, the application must be postmarked by that time. For applications delivered by hand delivery or carrier only, the receiving date of signature by NMFS staff is the date the application was received. If the application is submitted by facsimile, the receiving date of the application is the date stamped received by NMFS.

      (ii) Objective written evidence of timely application will be considered as proof of a timely application.

      (4)  A completed application must contain the information specified on the Application for Rockfish Cooperative Fishing Quota identifying the rockfish cooperative, members of the cooperative, and processor associate of a catcher vessel rockfish cooperative, with all applicable fields accurately filled-in and all required documentation attached. The initial application must contain all documents specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. Subsequent applications will only be required to resubmit documents specified at paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section if the information they contain has changed.

      (i)  For the cooperative application to be considered complete, the following documents must be attached to the initial application:

      (A) A copy of the business license issued by the state in which the rockfish cooperative is registered as a business entity;

      (B) A copy of the articles of incorporation or partnership agreement of the rockfish cooperative;

      (C) Provide the names of all persons, to the individual level, holding an ownership interest in the LLP license and the percentage ownership each person and individual holds in the LLP license;

      (D) A copy of the rockfish cooperative agreement signed by the members of the rockfish cooperative (if different from the articles of incorporation or partnership agreement of the rockfish cooperative) that includes terms that specify that:

      () Rockfish QS holders affiliated with rockfish processors cannot participate in price setting negotiations except as permitted by general antitrust law;

      () The rockfish cooperative must establish a monitoring program sufficient to ensure compliance with the Rockfish Program;

      () [Reserved]

      () Terms and conditions to specify the obligations of rockfish QS holders who are members of the rockfish cooperative to ensure the full payment of rockfish cost recovery fees that may be due.

      (ii)  The applicant, including the processor associate of the rockfish cooperative, must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. If the application is completed by a designated representative, then explicit authorization signed by the applicant must accompany the application.

      (5)  NMFS will not issue a CQ permit if an application is not complete and approved by NMFS. Issuance by NMFS of a CQ permit is not a determination that the rockfish cooperative is formed or is operating in compliance with antitrust law.

      (6)  NMFS will prohibit any LLP licenses with rockfish QS assigned to that LLP license from fishing in the directed rockfish primary fisheries in the Central GOA for a calendar year if that LLP license is not designated on a timely and complete application for CQ for that calendar year that is approved by NMFS. Rockfish sideboard provisions described in § 679.82 shall apply to that LLP license, as applicable.

      (g) —(1)  NMFS will process an application for inter-cooperative transfer of CQ provided that an electronic online transfer application is completed by the transferor and transferee, with all applicable fields accurately filled-in.

      (2)  (i) The transferor's designated representative must log into NMFS' online system and create a transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferor's NMFS ID and password, and submitting the transfer request, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (ii) The transferee's designated representative must log into the online system and accept the transfer request. By using the transferee's NMFS ID and password, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (h) —(1)  A vessel assigned to a rockfish cooperative and fishing under a CQ permit may harvest groundfish species not allocated as CQ up to the amounts of the MRAs for those species as established in Table 30 to this part.

      (2)  A rockfish eligible harvester who opted-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative is subject to MRAs for rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species as established in Table 10 to this part.

      (3)  A person directed fishing in the rockfish entry level longline fishery may harvest groundfish species other than rockfish primary species up to amounts of the MRAs for those species as established in Table 10 to this part.

      (4)  (i) The MRA for groundfish species not allocated as CQ (incidental catch species) for vessels fishing under the authority of a CQ permit is calculated as a proportion of the total allocated rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species on board the vessel in round weight equivalents using the retainable percentage in Table 30 to this part; except that—

      (ii) Once the amount of shortraker rockfish harvested in the catcher vessel sector is equal to 9.72 percent of the shortraker rockfish TAC in the Central GOA regulatory area, then shortraker rockfish may not be retained by any participant in the catcher vessel sector while fishing under the authority of a CQ permit.

      (5)  The MRA for groundfish species not allocated as CQ (incidental catch species) for vessels fishing under the authority of a CQ permit is calculated as a proportion of the total allocated rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species on board the vessel in round weight equivalents using the retainable percentage in Table 30 to this part as determined under § 679.20(e)(3)(iv).

      (i) —(1)  This section governs the formation and operation of rockfish cooperatives. The regulations in this section apply only to rockfish cooperatives that have formed for the purpose of fishing with CQ issued annually by NMFS.

      (i) Members of rockfish cooperatives should consult legal counsel before commencing any activity if the members are uncertain about the legality under the antitrust laws of the rockfish cooperative's proposed conduct.

      (ii) Membership in a rockfish cooperative is voluntary. No person may be required to join a rockfish cooperative.

      (iii) Members may leave a rockfish cooperative, but any CQ contributed by the rockfish QS held by that member remains assigned to that rockfish cooperative for the remainder of the calendar year.

      (iv) An LLP license or vessel that has been assigned to a rockfish cooperative and that leaves the rockfish cooperative continues to be subject to the sideboard provisions established for that rockfish cooperative under § 679.82(d) and (e), as applicable, for that calendar year.

      (v) If a person becomes the holder of an LLP license that had been previously assigned to a rockfish cooperative, then that person may join that rockfish cooperative upon receipt of that LLP license, but may not assign that LLP license to another rockfish cooperative during that calendar year.

      (2)  A rockfish cooperative must meet the following legal and organizational requirements before it is eligible to receive CQ:

      (i) Each rockfish cooperative must be formed as a partnership, corporation, or other legal business entity that is registered under the laws of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia;

      (ii) Each rockfish cooperative must appoint an individual as designated representative to act on the rockfish cooperative's behalf and serve as contact point for NMFS for questions regarding the operation of the rockfish cooperative. The designated representative must be an individual, and may be a member of the rockfish cooperative, or some other individual designated by the rockfish cooperative;

      (iii) Each rockfish cooperative must submit a complete and timely application for CQ.

      (3)  The following table describes the requirements to form a rockfish cooperative in the catcher vessel or catcher/processor sector.

      (4) —(i)  A person fishing CQ assigned to a rockfish cooperative must maintain a copy of the CQ permit onboard any vessel that is being used to harvest any rockfish primary species, or rockfish secondary species, or that uses any rockfish halibut PSC CQ.

      (ii)  Rockfish cooperatives may transfer CQ during a calendar year with the following restrictions:

      (A) A rockfish cooperative may only transfer CQ to another rockfish cooperative;

      (B) A rockfish cooperative may only receive CQ from another rockfish cooperative;

      (C) A rockfish cooperative may transfer or receive rockfish CQ only if that cooperative has been assigned at least two LLP licenses with rockfish QS assigned to those LLP licenses;

      (D) A rockfish cooperative in the catcher vessel sector may not transfer any CQ to a rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector;

      (E) A rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector may not transfer any rougheye rockfish CQ or shortraker rockfish CQ to a rockfish cooperative in the catcher vessel sector.

      (F) A rockfish cooperative receiving rockfish primary species CQ by transfer must assign that rockfish primary species CQ to a member(s) of the rockfish cooperative for the purposes of applying the use caps established under § 679.82(a). NMFS will not approve a transfer if that member would exceed the use cap as a result of the transfer. Rockfish secondary species or halibut PSC CQ is not assigned to a specific member of a rockfish cooperative;

      (G) A rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector may not transfer any sideboard limit assigned to it; and

      (H) After November 15 of the year for which the CQ permit is issued, or upon approval of a rockfish cooperative termination of fishing declaration described in § 679.4(n)(2):

      () A cooperative may only use rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species CQ for transfer;

      () A cooperative may not transfer halibut PSC CQ;

      (5)  (i) A rockfish cooperative in the catcher vessel sector may not use a rockfish primary species CQ in excess of the amounts specified in § 679.82(a).

      (ii) For purposes of CQ use cap calculation, the total amount of CQ held or used by a person is equal to all tons of CQ derived from the rockfish QS held by that person and assigned to the rockfish cooperative and all tons of CQ assigned to that person by the rockfish cooperative from approved transfers.

      (iii) The amount of rockfish QS held by a person, and CQ derived from that rockfish QS is calculated using the individual and collective use cap rule established in § 679.82(a).

      (6)  If a member of a rockfish cooperative dies (in the case of an individual) or dissolves (in the case of a business entity), the LLP license(s) and associated rockfish QS held by that person will be transferred to the legal successor-in-interest under the procedures described in § 679.4(k)(6)(iv)(A). However, the CQ derived from that rockfish QS and assigned to the rockfish cooperative for that year from that person remains under the control of the rockfish cooperative for the duration of that calendar year. Each rockfish cooperative is free to establish its own internal procedures for admitting a successor-in-interest during the fishing season to reflect the transfer of an LLP license and associated rockfish QS.

      (j)  Annual reallocation of Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species—

      (1)  After the Rockfish Program fisheries close on November 15, the Regional Administrator may reallocate any unused amount of Pacific cod from the Rockfish Program to other sectors through notification in the  consistent with regulations at § 679.20(a)(12)(ii).

      (2) —(i)  The Regional Administrator may reallocate a portion of a Central GOA rockfish ICAs to rockfish cooperatives if the amounts assigned to the Central GOA rockfish ICAs are projected not to be harvested or used. The timing of a reallocation will be at the discretion of the Regional Administrator.

      (ii)  If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a reallocation of a portion of the ICAs of Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species to rockfish cooperatives is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will issue a revised CQ permit to reallocate that amount of Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species to rockfish cooperatives according to the following:

      (A) Catcher vessel rockfish cooperatives will be given priority for reallocation; and

      (B) The amount of additional CQ issued to each rockfish cooperative = Amount of Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species available for reallocation to rockfish cooperatives × (Amount of CQ for that Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species initially assigned to that rockfish cooperative/Σ CQ for that Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish species initially assigned to all rockfish cooperatives in the respective sector).

      § 679.82   Rockfish Program use caps and sideboard limits.

#### § § 679.82

      (a) —(1)  (i) _Use caps_ limit the amount of rockfish QS that may be held or used by a rockfish eligible harvester and the amount of CQ that may be held or used by a rockfish cooperative, harvested by a vessel, or received or processed by a rockfish processor.

      (ii) Use caps do not apply to halibut PSC CQ.

      (iii) Use caps may not be exceeded unless the entity subject to the use cap is specifically allowed to exceed a cap according to the criteria established under this paragraph (a), or by an operation of law.

      (iv) All rockfish QS use caps are based on the aggregate rockfish primary species initial rockfish QS pool established by NMFS in Table 29 to this part.

      (v) Sablefish and Pacific cod CQ processing use caps are based on the amount of CQ assigned to the catcher vessel sector during a calendar year.

      (vi) Any transfer of reallocated rockfish ICA (as authorized under § 679.81(j)(2)) or catcher/processor CQ to a catcher vessel cooperative does not apply to catcher vessel ownership, cooperative, harvester CQ, or shoreside processor CQ use caps.

      (2)  A person may not individually or collectively hold or use more than:

      (i) Four (4.0) percent of the aggregate rockfish primary species QS initially assigned to the catcher vessel sector and resulting CQ unless that rockfish eligible harvester qualifies for an exemption to this use cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

      (ii) Forty (40.0) percent of the aggregate rockfish primary species QS initially assigned to the catcher/processor sector and resulting CQ unless that rockfish eligible harvester qualifies for an exemption to this use cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

      (3) [Reserved]

      (4)  (i) A catcher vessel may not harvest an amount of Pacific ocean perch CQ greater than 8.0 percent of the Pacific ocean perch CQ issued to the catcher vessel sector during a calendar year.

      (ii) A catcher/processor vessel may not harvest an amount of rockfish primary species CQ greater than 60.0 percent of the aggregate rockfish primary species CQ issued to the catcher/processor sector during a calendar year.

      (5)  (i) A rockfish processor may not receive or process an amount of rockfish primary species harvested with CQ assigned to the catcher vessel sector greater than 40.0 percent of the aggregate rockfish primary species CQ assigned to the catcher vessel sector during a calendar year.

      (ii) A rockfish processor may not receive or process an amount of Pacific cod harvested with CQ assigned to the catcher vessel sector greater than 40.0 percent of Pacific cod CQ issued to the catcher vessel sector during a calendar year.

      (iii) A rockfish processor may not receive or process an amount of sablefish harvested with CQ assigned to the catcher vessel sector greater than 40.0 percent of sablefish CQ issued to the catcher vessel sector during a calendar year.

      (6) —(i)  A rockfish QS holder may receive an initial allocation of aggregate rockfish QS in excess of the use cap in that sector only if that rockfish QS is assigned to LLP license(s) held by that rockfish eligible harvester prior to June 14, 2010, and continuously through the time of application for rockfish QS.

      (ii)  A rockfish eligible harvester that receives an initial allocation of aggregate rockfish QS that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not receive any rockfish QS by transfer (except by operation of law) unless and until that harvester's holdings of aggregate rockfish QS in that sector are reduced to an amount below the use cap specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (b)  Any vessel named on an LLP license that is not named on an approved Annual Application for Cooperative Fishing Quota, may not fish with any vessel named on the opted-out LLP license during that fishing year in any directed fishery for any rockfish primary species in the Central GOA and waters adjacent to the Central GOA when the rockfish primary species caught by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC specified under § 679.20.

      (c) — The regulations in this section restrict the vessels and holders of LLP licenses with rockfish legal landings that could generate rockfish QS from using the increased flexibility provided by the Rockfish Program to expand their level of participation in other GOA groundfish fisheries. These limitations are commonly known as “sideboards.”

      (1)  Three types of sideboard restrictions apply under the Rockfish Program:

      (i) Catcher vessel sideboard restrictions as described under paragraph (d) of this section;

      (ii) Catcher/processor rockfish sideboard restrictions as described under paragraph (e) of this section; and,

      (iii) Opt-out sideboard restrictions as described under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

      (2)  After NMFS determines which vessels and LLP licenses may be subject to sideboard limitations as described in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, NMFS will inform each vessel owner and LLP license holder in writing of the type of rockfish sideboard limitation and issue a revised Federal Fisheries Permit and/or LLP license that displays the sideboard limitation(s) that may apply to that FFP or LLP on its face.

      (3)  A vessel owner or LLP license holder who believes that NMFS has incorrectly identified his or her vessel or LLP license as meeting the criteria for a sideboard limitation, or who disagrees with the specific sideboard ratio assigned to that LLP license, may make a contrary claim and provide evidence to NMFS. All claims must be submitted in writing with any documentation or evidence supporting the request within 30 days of being notified by NMFS of the sideboard limitation. NMFS will provide instructions for submitting such claims with the sideboard notification. An applicant must submit any documentation or evidence supporting a claim within 30 days of being notified by NMFS of the sideboard limitation. If NMFS finds the claim is unsupported, the claim will be denied in an Initial Administrative Determination (IAD). The affected persons may appeal this IAD using the procedures described in § 679.43.

      (4)  Unless otherwise specified, all sideboard limitations established under paragraph (e) of this section only apply from July 1 through July 31 of each year.

      (d) —(1)  Any vessel not specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (d):

      (i) Any vessel whose rockfish legal landings could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher vessel sector; and,

      (ii) Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made that could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher vessel sector.

      (2)  The following vessels are exempt from the sideboard limits in paragraph (d) of this section:

      (i) Any AFA catcher vessel that is not exempt from GOA groundfish sideboards under the AFA as specified under § 679.64(b)(2)(ii);

      (ii) Any vessel that made rockfish legal landings during the fishery seasons established in Table 28a to this part and during the entry level trawl fishery during 2007, 2008, or 2009 established in Table 28b to this part and that is designated on an approved application for rockfish QS as being excluded from the Rockfish Program as specified under § 679.80(d)(4)(ii); and

      (iii) Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made during the fishery seasons established in Table 28a to this part and during the entry level trawl fishery during 2007, 2008, or 2009 established in Table 28b to this part if that LLP license is designated on an approved application for rockfish QS as being excluded from the Rockfish Program as specified under § 679.80(d)(4)(ii).

      (3)  Vessels subject to the provisions in this paragraph (d) may not participate in directed fishing in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District for northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and dusky rockfish (or in waters adjacent to the Western GOA and West Yakutat District when northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and dusky rockfish by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under § 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.

      (4)  Vessels subject to the provisions in this paragraph (d) may not participate in directed fishing for arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole in the GOA (or in waters adjacent to the GOA when arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole caught by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under § 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.

      (e) —(1)  Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (e):

      (i) Any vessel whose rockfish legal landings could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program; or

      (ii) Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made that could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program.

      (2)  Any vessel that meets the criteria established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and that is not an Amendment 80 vessel is prohibited from directed fishing for northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and dusky rockfish in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District (or in waters adjacent to the Western GOA and West Yakutat District when northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and dusky rockfish by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under § 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.

      (3)  NMFS will determine specific rockfish sideboard ratios for each LLP license assigned to the catcher/processor sector that could generate rockfish QS. These rockfish sideboard ratios will be noted on the face of an LLP license and will be calculated as follows:

      (i) For each rockfish sideboard fishery, divide the retained catch of that rockfish sideboard fishery from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 made under the authority of that LLP license, by the total retained catch of that rockfish sideboard fishery from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all eligible LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.

      (ii) For the deep-water halibut PSC sideboard limit, divide the halibut PSC used in the deep-water complex, except in the Central GOA rockfish fisheries, from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 under the authority of that LLP license, by the total deep-water halibut PSC used from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.

      (iii) For the shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limit, divide the halibut PSC used in the shallow-water complex from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 under the authority of that LLP license, by the total shallow-water halibut PSC used from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.

      (4)  The rockfish sideboard ratio for each rockfish fishery in the West Yakutat District is an established percentage of the TAC for catcher/processors in the directed fishery for dusky rockfish and Pacific ocean perch. These percentages are confidential.

      (5)  (i) The annual deep-water complex halibut PSC sideboard limit in the GOA is 2.5 percent of the annual halibut mortality limit.

      (ii) The annual shallow-water complex halibut PSC sideboard limit in the GOA is 0.1 percent of the annual halibut mortality limit.

      (6)  Each rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector will be assigned a portion of the rockfish sideboard limit for each rockfish species established in paragraph (e)(4) of this section according to the following formula.

      (i) For each rockfish sideboard fishery specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, sum the rockfish sideboard ratios of all LLP licenses as calculated under paragraph (e)(3) of this section assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount of TAC (in metric tons) assigned to that rockfish sideboard fishery.

      (ii) Once assigned, a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative may not exceed any rockfish sideboard limit assigned to that cooperative from July 1 through July 31.

      (7)  Holders of catcher/processor designated LLP licenses that opt-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative will receive the portion of each rockfish sideboard limit established in paragraph (e)(3) of this section not assigned to rockfish cooperatives.

      (8)  (i) If the Regional Administrator determines that an annual rockfish sideboard limit for opt-out vessels is sufficient to support directed fishing for that rockfish sideboard fishery, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance applicable to holders of catcher/processor designated LLPs that have opted-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative.

      (ii) If the Regional Administrator determines that a sideboard limit is insufficient to support a directed fishing allowance for that rockfish sideboard fishery, then the Regional Administrator may not allow directed fishing and set the allowance to zero for catcher/processor opt-out vessels from July 1 through July 31.

      (iii) Upon determining that a halibut PSC sideboard limit is or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for the rockfish sideboard fishery in the regulatory area or district for catcher/processor opt-out vessels that will be effective from July 1 through July 31.

      (9)  Each rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector will be assigned a percentage of the deep-water and shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limits based on the following calculation:

      (i) Sum the deep-water ratios of all LLP licenses assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount set out in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section; and

      (ii) Sum the shallow-water ratios of all LLP licenses assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount set out in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section; and

      (iii) A rockfish cooperative may not exceed any deep-water or shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limits assigned to that cooperative when directed fishing for species other than rockfish.

      (10)  Catcher/processor opt-out vessels will receive the portion of the deep-water and shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limit not assigned to catcher/processor rockfish cooperatives.

      (11)  (i) If the Regional Administrator determines that a halibut PSC sideboard limit for opt-out vessels is sufficient to support a directed fishing allowance for groundfish in the deep-water or shallow-water halibut PSC complex, then the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species or species group applicable to catcher/processor opt-out vessels.

      (ii) If the Regional Administrator determines that a sideboard limit is insufficient to support a directed fishing allowance for groundfish in the deep-water or shallow-water halibut PSC complex, then the Regional Administrator may not allow directed fishing and set the allowance to zero for the deep-water or shallow-water halibut PSC complex for catcher/processor opt-out vessels from July 1 through July 31.

      (iii) Upon determining that a halibut PSC sideboard limit is or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for the species or species in that complex for catcher/processors opt-out vessels that will be effective from July 1 through July 31. The following specific directed fishing closures will be implemented if a halibut PSC sideboard limit is reached:

      (A) If the shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limit for catcher/processor opt-out vessels is or will be reached, then NMFS will close directed fishing in the GOA for:

      () Flathead sole; and

      () Shallow-water flatfish.

      (B) If the deep-water halibut PSC sideboard limit is or will be reached for catcher/processor opt-out vessels, then NMFS will close directed fishing in the GOA for:

      () Rex sole;

      () Deep-water flatfish; and

      () Arrowtooth flounder.

      (iv)  Any halibut mortality occurring under a CQ permit from July 1 through July 31 will not apply against the halibut PSC sideboard limits established in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

      (f) —(1)  In addition to the sideboards for opt-out vessels in paragraphs (e)(7) and (e)(10) of this section, any catcher/processor opt-out vessel that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (f):

      (i) Any vessel whose legal rockfish landings could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector that is not assigned to a rockfish cooperative; or,

      (ii) Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority legal rockfish landings were made that could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector and that is not assigned to a rockfish cooperative.

      (2)  (i) Any vessel that is subject to the opt-out sideboard restriction under paragraph (f) of this section is prohibited from directed fishing in any groundfish fishery in the GOA and waters adjacent to the GOA when groundfish caught by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC specified under § 679.20 (except sablefish harvested under the IFQ Program) from July 1 through July 14 of each year if that vessel has not participated in that directed groundfish fishery in any 2 years from 2000 through 2006 during the following time periods:

      (A) July 9, 2000, through July 15, 2000;

      (B) July 1, 2001, through July 7, 2001;

      (F) July 3, 2005, through July 9, 2005; and

      (G) July 2, 2006, through July 8, 2006.

      (ii) For purposes of determining participation in a directed groundfish fishery for paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, a vessel may participate:

      (A) In the flathead sole and shallow-water flatfish fisheries if that vessel participated in a directed groundfish fishery for either of these two fisheries during any 2 years during the 2000 through 2006 qualifying period defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (B) In the arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole fisheries if that vessel participated in a directed groundfish fishery for any of these three fisheries during any 2 years during the 2000 through 2006 qualifying period defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.

      (b) —(1)  A CQ permit holder must use the rockfish standard ex-vessel value determined by NMFS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  Each year the Regional Administrator will publish rockfish standard ex-vessel values in the  during the first quarter of each calendar year. The standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per equivalent pound, for rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species landings made by rockfish CQ holders during the previous calendar year.

      (ii)  The rockfish standard ex-vessel value published by NMFS shall apply to all rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species landings made by a rockfish CQ holder during the previous calendar year.

      (iii)  NMFS will calculate the rockfish standard ex-vessel value to reflect, as closely as possible by month, the variations in the actual ex-vessel values of landings based on information provided in the Rockfish Ex-vessel Volume and Value Report as described in § 679.5(r)(10). The Regional Administrator will base rockfish standard ex-vessel values on the following types of information:

      (A) Landed pounds by rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species landings and month;

      (B) Total ex-vessel value by rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species landings and month; and

      (C) Price adjustments, including retroactive payments.

      (c) —(1)  The rockfish fee percentage is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (C) The costs directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of the Rockfish Program.

      (ii)  NMFS must use the following equations to determine the fee percentage:

      (3) —(i)  During the first quarter of the year following the calendar year in which the rockfish CQ landings were made, NMFS shall calculate the rockfish fee percentage based on the calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  The calculated rockfish fee percentage is applied to rockfish CQ landings made in the previous calendar year.

      (4)  The CQ permit holder must use the rockfish fee percentage applicable at the time a rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species landing is debited from a rockfish CQ allocation to calculate the rockfish cost recovery fee liability for any retroactive payments for that rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species.

      (5)  (i) All rockfish CQ holders will be subject to a fee liability for any rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species CQ debited from a rockfish CQ allocation during a calendar year.

      (ii) The rockfish fee liability assessed to a rockfish CQ holder will be based on the proportion of the standard ex-vessel value of rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species debited from a rockfish CQ holder relative to all rockfish CQ holders during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (iii) NMFS will provide a fee liability summary letter to all CQ permit holders during the first quarter of the year following the calendar year in which the rockfish CQ landings were made. The summary will explain the fee liability determination including the current fee percentage, details of rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species CQ pounds debited from rockfish CQ allocations by permit, species, date, and prices.

      (d)  (1) Pursuant to § 679.81(f), no rockfish CQ holder will receive any rockfish CQ until the rockfish CQ holder submits a complete application. A complete application shall include full payment of an applicant's complete rockfish cost recovery fee liability.

      (2) If a rockfish CQ holder fails to submit full payment for rockfish cost recovery fee liability by the date described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:

      (i) At any time thereafter send an IAD to the CQ permit holder stating that the CQ permit holder's estimated fee liability, as indicated by his or her own submitted information, is the rockfish cost recovery fee liability due from the CQ permit holder.

      (ii) Disapprove any application to transfer rockfish CQ to or from the CQ permit holder in accordance with § 679.81(g).

      (3) If a rockfish CQ holder fails to submit full payment by the rockfish cost recovery fee liability payment deadline described at paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

      (i) No CQ permit will be issued to that rockfish CQ holder for that calendar year; and

      (ii) No rockfish CQ will be issued based on the rockfish QS held by the members of that rockfish cooperative to any other CQ permit for that calendar year.

      (4) Upon final agency action determining that a CQ permit holder has not paid his or her rockfish cost recovery fee liability, the Regional Administrator may continue to prohibit issuance of a CQ permit for any subsequent calendar years until NMFS receives the unpaid fees. If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.

      (e)  Upon issuance of final agency action, payment submitted to NMFS in excess of the rockfish cost recovery fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the CQ permit holder unless the permit holder requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the permit holder's future rockfish cost recovery fee liability. Payment processing fees may be deducted from any fees returned to the CQ permit holder.

      (f)  A CQ permit holder who receives an IAD for incomplete payment of a rockfish fee liability may appeal the IAD pursuant to 50 CFR 679.43.

      (g)  Each year, NMFS will publish a report describing the rockfish program cost recovery fee program.

      (3)  Only Amendment 80 legal landings as defined in § 679.2 will be used to assign Amendment 80 QS units to an Amendment 80 QS permit unless an Amendment 80 vessel has no Amendment 80 legal landings, in which case Amendment 80 QS units will be allocated to the Amendment 80 QS permit derived from that Amendment 80 vessel according to the procedures established under paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section.

      (4)  An Amendment 80 legal landing is assigned only to the Amendment 80 vessel that was used to make that Amendment 80 legal landing.

      (d) —(1) Amendment 80 QS units derived from an Amendment 80 vessel and issued to an Amendment 80 QS holder. NMFS will assign a specific amount of Amendment 80 QS units to each Amendment 80 QS permit based on the Amendment 80 legal landings of each Amendment 80 vessel for each Amendment 80 species in each management area for that Amendment 80 species as listed in Table 32 to this part, using information from the Amendment 80 official record according to the following procedures:

      (i)  (A) For each Amendment 80 species, sum the Amendment 80 legal landings for each Amendment 80 vessel in all management areas for that Amendment 80 species listed in Table 32 to this part for each calendar year from 1998 through 2004.

      (B) Select the five calendar years that yield the highest amount of Amendment 80 legal landings of that Amendment 80 species in all management areas for that Amendment 80 species listed in Table 32 to this part, including zero metric tons if necessary.

      (C) Sum the Amendment 80 legal landings of the highest five years for an Amendment 80 species. This yields the Highest Five Years for that Amendment 80 species.

      (D) Divide the Highest Five Years for an Amendment 80 species in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section for an Amendment 80 vessel by the sum of all Highest Five Years for all Amendment 80 vessels for that Amendment 80 species based on the Amendment 80 official record for that Amendment 80 species as presented in the following equation:

      (ii)  Multiply the Percentage of the Total for that Amendment 80 vessel for Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch and BSAI Pacific cod as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section by the Amendment 80 initial QS pool for Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch and BSAI Pacific cod as set forth in Table 32 to this part. This yields the number of Amendment 80 QS units for that Amendment 80 vessel for Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean perch and BSAI Pacific cod Pacific cod.

      (iii)  (A) If an Amendment 80 vessel did not have any Amendment 80 legal landings during 1998 through 2004, that Amendment 80 vessel will receive 0.5 percent of the Percentage of the Total for BSAI rock sole and BSAI yellowfin sole as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

      (B) All Amendment 80 vessels that did have Amendment 80 legal landings will have the Percentage of the Total assigned to that Amendment 80 vessel as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section adjusted to account for the assignment of the Percentage of the Total to Amendment 80 vessels under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section for BSAI rock sole and BSAI yellowfin sole as presented in the following equation:

      (C) Multiply the Adjusted Percentage of the Total for that Amendment 80 vessel by the Amendment 80 initial QS pool for BSAI rock sole and BSAI yellowfin sole as set forth in Table 32 to this part. This yields the number of Amendment 80 QS units for that Amendment 80 vessel for BSAI rock sole or BSAI yellowfin sole.

      (iv)  (A) If an Amendment 80 vessel did not have any Amendment 80 legal landings during 1998 through 2004, that Amendment 80 vessel will receive 0.1 percent of the Percentage of the Total for BSAI flathead sole as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

      (B) All Amendment 80 vessels that did have Amendment 80 legal landings during 1998 through 2004 will have the Percentage of the Total assigned to that Amendment 80 vessel as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section adjusted to account for the assignment of the Percentage of the Total to Amendment 80 vessels under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section for BSAI flathead sole as presented in the following equation:

      (C) Multiply the Adjusted Percentage of the Total for that Amendment 80 vessel by the Amendment 80 initial QS pool for BSAI flathead sole as set forth in Table 32 to this part. This yields the number of Amendment 80 QS units for that Amendment 80 vessel for BSAI flathead sole.

      (v)  (A) Multiply the Percentage of the Total for that Amendment 80 vessel as calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section by the Amendment 80 initial QS pool for BSAI Atka mackerel as set forth in Table 32 to this part. This yields the number of Amendment 80 QS units for that Amendment 80 vessel for _BSAI Atka mackerel._

      (B) If an Amendment 80 vessel is an Amendment 80 non-mackerel vessel, determine the percentage of the Amendment 80 QS pool that is assigned to each Atka mackerel management area listed in Table 32 to this part in each year from 1998 through 2004 for that Amendment 80 non-mackerel vessel based on the percentage of Amendment 80 legal landings in that Atka mackerel management area from 1998 through 2004 for that Amendment 80 non-mackerel vessel.

      (C) The sum of the Amendment 80 QS units allocated to all Amendment 80 non-mackerel vessels is the Total Amendment 80 non-mackerel QS pool.

      (D) The sum of the Amendment 80 QS units allocated to all Amendment 80 mackerel vessels is the Total Amendment 80 mackerel QS pool.

      (2)  Once the Regional Administrator determines the amount of Amendment 80 QS units to be issued for an Amendment 80 species derived from an Amendment 80 vessel based on the criteria described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, NMFS will assign that amount of Amendment 80 QS units for each Amendment 80 species as an Amendment 80 QS permit to the Amendment 80 QS holder as follows:

      (i)  NMFS will issue an Amendment 80 QS permit for each Amendment 80 vessel to the owner of that Amendment 80 vessel if that person submitted a timely and complete Application for Amendment 80 QS that was approved by NMFS under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; or

      (ii)  NMFS will issue an Amendment 80 QS permit as an endorsement on an Amendment 80 LLP license to the holder of an LLP license originally assigned to an Amendment 80 vessel listed in Column A of Table 31 to this part, under the provisions of § 679.4(k)(7), if that person submitted a timely and complete Application for Amendment 80 QS that was approved by NMFS under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (e) —(1)  (i) An Amendment 80 QS holder may not transfer an Amendment 80 QS permit to another person unless all Amendment 80 QS units for all Amendment 80 species on that Amendment 80 QS permit are transferred in their entirety to the same person at the same time; and

      (ii) If an Amendment 80 QS permit is assigned to an Amendment 80 LLP license originally assigned to an Amendment 80 vessel, that Amendment 80 LLP license is designated as an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license. A person may not separate the Amendment 80 QS permit from that Amendment 80 LLP/QS license.

      (2)  A person holding an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license may transfer that Amendment 80 LLP/QS license to another person only under the provisions of § 679.4(k)(7).

      (3)  (i) A person holding an Amendment 80 QS permit assigned to an Amendment 80 vessel may transfer that Amendment 80 QS permit to another person, to the LLP license originally assigned to an Amendment 80 vessel, or to a vessel approved by NMFS as an Amendment 80 replacement vessel in accordance with § 679.4(o)(4) by submitting an Application to Transfer an Amendment 80 QS permit that is approved by NMFS under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

      (ii) A person holding an Amendment 80 LLP license that is designated as an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license may designate a vessel approved as an Amendment 80 replacement vessel by submitting an Application For Transfer License Limitation Program Groundfish/Crab License that is approved by NMFS under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

      (4)  An Amendment 80 vessel owner holding an Amendment 80 QS permit assigned to an Amendment 80 vessel may transfer that Amendment 80 QS permit to the LLP license originally assigned to that Amendment 80 vessel only by submitting an application to transfer an Amendment 80 QS permit that is approved by NMFS under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

      (f)  A person holding an Amendment 80 QS permit who wishes to transfer the Amendment 80 QS permit to the LLP license originally assigned to the Amendment 80 vessel, or transfer the Amendment 80 QS permit to another person, or transfer the Amendment 80 QS permit to an Amendment 80 replacement vessel must submit to NMFS a complete Application to Transfer an Amendment 80 QS permit. The holder of an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license may designate the replacement vessel on the LLP license by using the Application for Transfer License Limitation Program Groundfish/Crab License. An application must contain the information specified on the form, with all required fields accurately completed and all required documentation attached.

If the application is completed by a designated representative, then explicit authorization signed by the applicant must accompany the application.

      (c) —(1)  Each calendar year, the Regional Administrator will determine the tonnage of Amendment 80 species that will be assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector and the Amendment 80 sector. For participants in the Amendment 80 sector, the tonnage of fish will be further assigned between Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.

      (2) —(i)  NMFS will determine the TAC and ITAC for each Amendment 80 species in a calendar year in the annual harvest specification process in § 679.20.

      (ii)  The annual apportionment of ITAC for each Amendment 80 species between the Amendment 80 sector and the BSAI trawl limited access sector in a given calendar year is established in Tables 33 and 34 to this part.

      (3) —(i)  The amount of ITAC for each Amendment 80 species assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative is equal to the amount of Amendment 80 QS units assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative by Amendment 80 QS holders divided by the total Amendment 80 QS pool multiplied by the Amendment 80 sector ITAC for that Amendment 80 species in that management area. Once ITAC for an Amendment 80 species in a management area is assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative, it is issued as CQ specific to that Amendment 80 cooperative.

      (ii)  The amount of CQ for each Amendment 80 species except BSAI Atka mackerel that is assigned to a Amendment 80 cooperative is expressed algebraically as follows:

      (iii)  The amount of CQ for BSAI Atka mackerel that is assigned to each Amendment 80 cooperative in each management area is determined by the following procedure:

      (A) Determine the amount of non-mackerel ITAC in each management area using the following equation:

      (B) Determine the amount of mackerel ITAC in each management area using the following equation:

      (C) Determine the amount of non-mackerel CQ assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative using the following equation:

      (D) Determine the amount of mackerel CQ assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative using the following equation:

      (E) The total amount of Atka mackerel CQ assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative for a management area is equal to the sum of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(C) and (D) of this section.

      (4)  The amount of ITAC in a management area for each Amendment 80 species assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the Amendment 80 sector ITAC remaining after subtracting all CQ issued to all Amendment 80 cooperatives for that Amendment 80 species in that management area.

      (d) —(1)  The amount of halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 sector for each calendar year is determined according to the procedure in § 679.21(b)(1)(i). That halibut PSC limit is then assigned to Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. If one or more Amendment 80 vessels participate in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery, the halibut PSC limit assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperatives will be reduced pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

      (2)  For each calendar year, the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned as CQ to an Amendment 80 cooperative is determined by the following procedure:

      (i) Multiply the amount of annual halibut PSC established according to the procedure in § 679.21(b)(1)(i) by the percentage of the Amendment 80 halibut PSC apportioned to each Amendment 80 species as established in table 36 to this part. This yields the halibut PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species.

      (ii) For each Amendment 80 species, divide the amount of Amendment 80 QS units assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative by the Amendment 80 QS pool. This yields the percentage of Amendment 80 QS units held by that Amendment 80 cooperative.

      (iii) For each Amendment 80 species, multiply the halibut PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the percentage of the Amendment 80 QS pool assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative for that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. This yields the amount of halibut PSC apportioned to that cooperative for that Amendment 80 species.

      (iv) For each Amendment 80 cooperative, sum the results of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section for all Amendment 80 species. This yields the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative as CQ.

      (3)  The amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC limit assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the amount of halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector, as established according to the procedure in § 679.21(b)(1)(i), less the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned as CQ to all Amendment 80 cooperatives as determined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, multiplied by 80 percent.

      (4) —(i)  An amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC is assigned to the CQ permit issued to an Amendment 80 cooperative for use while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any halibut PSC used by an Amendment 80 cooperative must be deducted from the amount of halibut PSC CQ on its CQ permit. Amendment 80 halibut PSC on a CQ permit may only be used by the members of the Amendment 80 cooperative to which it is assigned. Halibut PSC assigned as CQ is not subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (ii)  An amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for use by all Amendment 80 vessels in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any halibut PSC used by Amendment 80 vessels assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery must be deducted from the amount of halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (5)  Halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector for groundfish fishing in the BSAI may only be used by the members of the BSAI trawl limited access sector unless modified by reallocation to Amendment 80 cooperatives according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. Halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (e) —(1)  The amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector for each Amendment 80 crab PSC in a calendar year is specified in Table 35 to this part. That amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is then assigned to Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.

      (2)  For each calendar year, for each Amendment 80 crab PSC, the amount assigned as CQ to an Amendment 80 cooperative is determined by the following procedure:

      (i) Multiply the amount of an Amendment 80 crab PSC established in Table 35 to this part by the percentage of the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportioned to each Amendment 80 species as established in Table 36 to this part. This yields the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species.

      (ii) For each Amendment 80 species, divide the amount of Amendment 80 QS units assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative by the Amendment 80 QS pool. This yields the percentage of Amendment 80 QS units held by that Amendment 80 cooperative.

      (iii) For each Amendment 80 species, multiply the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportionment to that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section by the percentage of the Amendment 80 QS pool held by an Amendment 80 cooperative as established in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. This yields the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC apportioned to that Amendment 80 cooperative for that Amendment 80 species.

      (iv) For each Amendment 80 crab PSC, sum the results of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) for all Amendment 80 species. This yields the amount of that Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative.

      (3)  The amount of each Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the amount of that Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector specified in Table 35 to this part subtracting the amount of that crab PSC that has been assigned as CQ to all Amendment 80 cooperatives as determined in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.

      (4)  An amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is assigned to the CQ permit issued to an Amendment 80 cooperative for use while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any Amendment 80 crab PSC used by an Amendment 80 cooperative must be deducted from the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC CQ on its CQ permit. Amendment 80 crab PSC on a CQ permit may only be used by the members of the Amendment 80 cooperative to which it is assigned. Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned as CQ is not subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (ii)  An amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for use by all Amendment 80 vessels in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any Amendment 80 crab PSC used by Amendment 80 vessels assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery must be deducted from the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (5)  Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector for groundfish fishing in the BSAI may only be used by the members of the BSAI trawl limited access sector unless modified by reallocation to Amendment 80 cooperatives according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21.

      (f) —(1)  The Regional Administrator may reallocate a portion of an ICA or ITAC of an Amendment 80 species, crab PSC, or halibut PSC amount assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives if the amount assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is projected not to be harvested or used. Any reallocation will result in an amended CQ permit for each Amendment 80 cooperative. The timing of a reallocation will be at the discretion of the Regional Administrator.

      (2)  The Regional Administrator may consider the following factors when reallocating an ICA, a directed fishing allowance of an Amendment 80 species, or crab PSC, or halibut PSC amounts from the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives:

      (i) The risk of biological harm to a groundfish species or species group;

      (ii) The risk of socioeconomic harm to other domestic fishery participants;

      (iii) The impact that the allocation might have on the socioeconomic well-being of Amendment 80 cooperatives;

      (iv) Current catch and PSC use in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;

      (v) Historic catch and PSC use in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;

      (vi) Harvest capacity and any stated intent on the future harvesting patterns of vessels in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;

      (vii) Administrative requirements to reissue CQ permits; and

      (viii) Any other relevant biological, socioeconomic, or administrative factors.

      (3)  If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a reallocation of a portion of the ITAC or ICA of an Amendment 80 species assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will issue a revised CQ permit to reallocate that amount of Amendment 80 species to each Amendment 80 cooperative according to the following formula:

      (4)  If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a reallocation of a portion of the halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will issue a revised CQ permit to reallocate that amount of halibut PSC to each Amendment 80 cooperative according to the following procedure:

      (i) Multiply the amount of the halibut PSC limit to be reallocated by 95 percent (0.95). This yields the maximum amount of halibut PSC available for allocation to Amendment 80 cooperatives; and

      (ii) Determine the halibut PSC CQ issued to each Amendment 80 cooperative according to the following formula:

      (5)  If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a reallocation of a portion of a crab PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will issue a revised CQ permit to reallocate that amount of crab PSC to each Amendment 80 cooperative according to the following formula:

      (g) —(1)  NMFS will process an application for inter-cooperative transfer of Amendment 80 cooperative quota (CQ) provided that a paper or electronic application is completed by the transferor and transferee, with all applicable fields accurately filled in, and all required additional documentation is attached.

      (2)  Amendment 80 species CQ must be assigned to a member of the Amendment 80 cooperative receiving the CQ for purposes of use cap calculations. No member of an Amendment 80 cooperative may exceed the CQ use cap applicable to that member.

      (3)  For purposes of Amendment 80 species CQ use cap calculations, the total amount of Amendment 80 species CQ held or used by a person is equal to all metric tons of Amendment 80 species CQ derived from all Amendment 80 QS units on all Amendment 80 QS permits held by that person and assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative and all metric tons of Amendment 80 species CQ assigned to that person by the Amendment 80 cooperative from approved transfers.

      (4)  The amount of Amendment 80 QS units held by a person, and CQ derived from those Amendment 80 QS units, is calculated using the individual and collective use cap rule established in § 679.92(a).

      (5) —(i)  The transferor's designated representative must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete. The transferor's designated representative must submit the paper application as indicated on the application.

      (ii)  The transferor's designated representative must log into the system and create a transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferor's NMFS ID, password, and Transfer Key and submitting the transfer request, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (6) —(i)  The transferee's designated representative must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (ii)  The transferee's designated representative must log into the system and accept the transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferee's NMFS ID, password and Transfer Key, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (h) —(1)  This section governs the formation and operation of _Amendment 80 cooperative_s. The regulations in this section apply only to Amendment 80 cooperatives that have formed for the purpose of applying for and fishing with CQ issued annually by NMFS. Members of Amendment 80 cooperatives should consult legal counsel before commencing any activity if the members are uncertain about the legality under the antitrust laws of the Amendment 80 cooperative's proposed conduct. Membership in an Amendment 80 cooperative is voluntary. No person may be required to join an Amendment 80 cooperative. If a person becomes the owner of an Amendment 80 vessel or a holder of an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license that has been assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative, then that person may join that Amendment 80 cooperative as a member upon receipt of that Amendment 80 vessel or Amendment 80 LLP/QS license. Members may leave an Amendment 80 cooperative, but any CQ contributed by the Amendment 80 QS permit(s) held by that member will remain with that Amendment 80 cooperative for the duration of the calendar year.

      (2)  An Amendment 80 cooperative must meet the following legal and organizational requirements before it is eligible to receive CQ:

      (i) Each Amendment 80 cooperative must be formed as a partnership, corporation, or other legal business entity that is registered under the laws of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia;

      (ii) Each Amendment 80 cooperative must appoint an individual as the designated representative to act on the Amendment 80 cooperative's behalf and to serve as a contact point for NMFS for questions regarding the operation of the Amendment 80 cooperative. The designated representative may be a member of the Amendment 80 cooperative, or some other individual designated by the Amendment 80 cooperative to act on its behalf;

      (iii) Each Amendment 80 cooperative must submit a timely and complete application for CQ; and

      (iv) Each Amendment 80 cooperative must meet the mandatory requirements established in paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section applicable to that Amendment 80 cooperative.

      (3)  The following table describes the requirements to form an Amendment 80 cooperative:

      (4)  If a member of an Amendment 80 cooperative dies (in the case of an individual) or dissolves (in the case of a business entity), the CQ derived from the Amendment 80 QS permits assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative for that year from that person remains under the control of the Amendment 80 cooperative for the duration of that calendar year as specified in the Amendment 80 cooperative contract. Each Amendment 80 cooperative is free to establish its own internal procedures for admitting a successor-in-interest during the fishing season due to the death or dissolution of an Amendment 80 cooperative member.

      (i) —(1)  The Regional Administrator will determine the _Amendment 80 ABC reserves_ for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole that will be assigned to the Amendment 80 sector as part of the annual harvest specifications described at § 679.20(c). Amendment 80 ABC reserves will be further allocated to Amendment 80 cooperative(s), as described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

      (2)  The amount of Amendment 80 ABC reserve for each species of flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative is equal to the amount of Amendment 80 QS units of that species assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative by Amendment 80 QS holders divided by the total Amendment 80 QS pool for that species multiplied by the Amendment 80 ABC reserve for that species.

      (3)  An Amendment 80 cooperative may request that NMFS approve a Flatfish Exchange to add flathead sole, rock sole, or yellowfin sole CQ to its Amendment 80 CQ account in exchange for reducing its Amendment 80 CQ by an equal amount of flathead sole, rock sole, or yellowfin sole. An Amendment 80 cooperative may request Flatfish Exchanges by submitting a completed Flatfish Exchange Application as described in § 679.4(p).

      § 679.92   Amendment 80 Program use caps and sideboard limits.

#### § § 679.92

      (a) —(1)  _Use caps_ limit the amount of Amendment 80 QS units and Amendment 80 species CQ that may be held or used by an Amendment 80 QS holder or Amendment 80 vessel. Use caps may not be exceeded unless the Amendment 80 QS holder or Amendment 80 vessel subject to the use cap is specifically allowed to exceed a cap according to the criteria established under this paragraph (a) or by an operation of law. There are two types of use caps: Person use caps and vessel use caps. All Amendment 80 QS unit use caps are based on the aggregate Amendment 80 species Amendment 80 initial QS pool set forth in Table 32 to this part. The use caps apply as follows:

      (2) —(i)  A person may not individually or collectively hold or use more than thirty (30.0) percent of the aggregate Amendment 80 QS units initially assigned to the Amendment 80 sector and resulting CQ unless that person receives those Amendment 80 QS units on an Amendment 80 permit(s) based on Amendment 80 legal landings assigned to Amendment 80 vessel(s) or Amendment 80 LLP license(s) held by that Amendment 80 QS holder:

      (A) Prior to June 9, 2006; and

      (B) At the time of application for Amendment 80 QS.

      (ii)  For purposes of calculating and applying the CQ use cap, a person is assigned CQ based on:

      (A) The amount of CQ derived from the Amendment 80 QS units held by that person; and

      (B) Any CQ assigned to that person in an Application for CQ transfer.

      (iii)  (A) An Amendment 80 QS holder that receives an initial allocation of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section cannot receive any Amendment 80 QS permit by transfer unless and until that person's holdings of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units are reduced to an amount below the use cap specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (B) If an Amendment 80 QS holder that received an initial allocation of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units on his or her Amendment 80 QS permits that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section transfers an Amendment 80 QS permit to another person, the transferor may not hold more than the greater of either the amount of Amendment 80 QS units held by the transferor after the transfer if the amount of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units continues to exceed the use cap, or the amount equal to the Amendment 80 QS unit use cap established in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (C) An Amendment 80 QS holder that receives an initial allocation of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units on his or her Amendment 80 QS permits that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is prohibited from having any CQ assigned to that Amendment 80 QS holder in an application for CQ transfer unless and until that Amendment 80 QS holder's holdings of aggregate Amendment 80 QS units are reduced to an amount below the use cap specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (3)  An Amendment 80 vessel may not be used to catch an amount of Amendment 80 species greater than twenty (20.0) percent of the aggregate Amendment 80 species ITACs assigned to the Amendment 80 sector. This amount includes ITAC that is assigned as CQ or to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.

      (b) —(1)  Amendment 80 vessels may not be used to catch more than the amounts of groundfish in the management areas specified in Table 37 to this part from January 1 through December 31 of each year, except that GOA groundfish sideboard limits specified in Table 37 to this part do not apply when an Amendment 80 vessel is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops in the GOA.

      (2)  All Amendment 80 vessels, other than the fishing vessel GOLDEN FLEECE as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, may not use halibut PSC in the fishery categories and management areas, greater than the amounts specified in Table 38 to this part during January 1 through December 31 of each year. Any residual amount of a seasonal sideboard halibut PSC limit may carry forward to the next season limit. This restriction on halibut PSC usage does not apply to the following two exceptions:

      (i) An Amendment 80 vessel that uses halibut PSC CQ in the Central GOA subject to the regulations established in the Rockfish Program under subpart G to this part is not subject to the halibut PSC sideboard limits in Table 38 to this part while fishing under a Rockfish CQ permit; and

      (ii) Halibut PSC sideboard limits in Table 38 to this part do not apply when an Amendment 80 vessel is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops in the GOA.

      (c) —(1)  An Amendment 80 vessel listed in column A of Table 39 to this part may be used to fish in the directed arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, rex sole, and shallow-water flatfish fisheries in the GOA and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season.

      (2)  (i) Any vessel that NMFS approves to replace an Amendment 80 vessel listed in column A of Table 39 to this part may be used to fish in the directed arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, rex sole, and shallow-water flatfish fisheries in the GOA and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season.

      (ii) Any vessel that NMFS subsequently approves to replace an Amendment 80 replacement vessel that replaced an Amendment 80 vessel listed in column A of Table 39 to this part may be used to fish in the directed arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, rex sole, and shallow-water flatfish fisheries in the GOA and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season.

      (d)  (1) The fishing vessel GOLDEN FLEECE (USCG documentation number 609951):

      (i) May not be used for directed groundfish fishing for northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, pollock, Pacific cod, or Pacific ocean perch in the GOA and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season; and

      (ii) Is not subject to halibut PSC sideboard limits as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the GOA or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season.

      (2)  (i) If the vessel replacing the GOLDEN FLEECE is of an LOA less than or equal to 124 ft. (38.1 m) (the MLOA of the LLP license that was originally assigned to the GOLDEN FLEECE, LLG 2524), then the sideboard provisions at § 679.92(c) and (d)(1) apply.

      (ii) If the vessel replacing the GOLDEN FLEECE is greater than 124 ft. (38.1 m) (the MLOA of the LLP license that was originally assigned to the GOLDEN FLEECE, LLG 2524), then the sideboard provisions at § 679.92(b) and (c) apply.

      (e)  All Amendment 80 vessels not designated on:

      (1) An Amendment 80 QS permit and an Amendment 80 LLP license; or

      (2) An Amendment 80 LLP/QS license will be allocated a catch limit of 0 mt in the BSAI and GOA.

      § 679.93   Amendment 80 Program recordkeeping, permits, monitoring, and catch accounting.

#### § § 679.93

      (a)  See § 679.5(s).

      (b)  See § 679.4(o).

      (c)  The requirements under paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section apply to all Amendment 80 vessels except Amendment 80 vessels using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops, and any other catcher/processor not listed in § 679.4(l)(2)(i) using trawl gear and fishing or receiving fish in the BSAI and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Except when using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops, at all times when an Amendment 80 vessel or a catcher/processor not listed in § 679.4(l)(2)(i) using trawl gear has BSAI groundfish onboard the vessel, the vessel owner or operator must ensure that:

      (1)  All catch, except halibut sorted on deck by vessels participating in halibut deck sorting described at § 679.102, are weighed on a NMFS-approved scale in compliance with the scale requirements at § 679.28(b). Each haul must be weighed separately, all catch must be made available for sampling by a NMFS-certified observer, and no sorting of catch, except halibut sorted on deck by vessels participating in halibut deck sorting described at § 679.102, may take place prior to weighing.

      (2)  An observer sampling station meeting the requirements at § 679.28(d) is available at all times.

      (3)  The vessel is in compliance with the observer coverage requirements described at § 679.51(a)(2).

      (4)  The vessel has no more than one operational line or other conveyance for the mechanized movement of catch between the scale used to weigh total catch and the location where the observer collects species composition samples.

      (5)  No fish are allowed to remain on deck unless an observer is present, except for fish inside the codend and fish accidentally spilled from the codend during hauling and dumping. Fish accidentally spilled from the codend must be moved to the fish bin.

      (6)  There is sufficient space to accommodate a minimum of 10 observer sampling baskets. This space must be within or adjacent to the observer sampling station.

      (7)  The Observer Program is notified by phone at 1 (907) 581-2060 (Dutch Harbor, AK) or 1 (907) 481-1770 (Kodiak, AK) at least 24 hours prior to departure when the vessel will be carrying an observer who has not previously been deployed on that vessel within the last 12 months. Subsequent to the vessel's departure notification, but prior to departure, NMFS may contact the vessel to arrange for a pre-cruise meeting. The pre-cruise meeting must minimally include the vessel operator or manager and any observers assigned to the vessel.

      (8)  The vessel operator stops the flow of fish and clears all belts between the bin doors and the area where the observer collects samples of unsorted catch when requested to do so by the observer.

      (9)  The vessel owner or operator must comply with the bin monitoring standards specified in § 679.28(i)(1).

      (d)  The requirements under this section apply to any Amendment 80 vessel fishing in the GOA and in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season except Amendment 80 vessels using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops. At all times when an Amendment 80 vessel is not using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops and has GOA groundfish onboard the vessel owner or operator must ensure that:

      (1) Catch from an individual haul is not mixed with catch from another haul prior to sampling by an observer, and all catch is made available for sampling by an observer;

      (2) The vessel is in compliance with the observer coverage requirements described at § 679.51(a)(2);

      (3)  The vessel has no more than one operational line or other conveyance for the mechanized movement of catch at the location where the observer collects species composition samples; and

      (4) The requirements in § 679.93(c)(5), (8), and (9) are met.

      (e) —(1) —(i)  All _Amendment 80 species_ caught in the BSAI, including catch in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, by an Amendment 80 vessel assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative will be debited from the CQ permit for that Amendment 80 cooperative for that calendar year unless that Amendment 80 vessel is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops.

      (ii)  All Amendment 80 species caught in the BSAI, including catch in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, by an Amendment 80 vessel assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery will be debited against the ITAC for that Amendment 80 species in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for that calendar year unless that Amendment 80 vessel is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops.

      (2) —(i)  All crab PSC or halibut PSC used by an Amendment 80 vessel assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative in the BSAI, including crab PSC or halibut PSC used in the adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, will be debited against the CQ permit for that Amendment 80 cooperative for that calendar year unless that Amendment 80 vessel is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops.

      (ii)  All crab PSC or halibut PSC used by an Amendment 80 vessel assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery in the BSAI, including crab PSC or halibut PSC used in the adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, will be debited against the crab PSC or halibut PSC limit assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for that calendar year, unless that Amendment 80 vessels is using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops.

      (3)  All Amendment 80 sideboard species defined in Table 37 to this part caught in the GOA, including catch in adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, by an Amendment 80 vessel will be debited against the Amendment 80 sideboard limit for that Amendment 80 sideboard species for that calendar year except Amendment 80 sideboard species caught by Amendment 80 vessel using dredge gear while directed fishing for scallops.

      (4)  All halibut PSC used by all Amendment 80 vessels in the GOA, including halibut PSC used in the adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season, will be debited against the sideboard limit established for the Amendment 80 sector, except:

      (i) Halibut PSC CQ used by the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program in the Central GOA;

      (ii) Halibut PSC used by the fishing vessel GOLDEN FLEECE (USCG Documentation number 609951); and

      § 679.95   Amendment 80 Program cost recovery.

#### § § 679.95

      (a) —(1)  The person designated as the Amendment 80 cooperative representative at the time of an Amendment 80 CQ landing must comply with the requirements of this section, notwithstanding:

      (i) Subsequent transfer of Amendment 80 CQ or Amendment 80 QS held by Amendment 80 cooperative members;

      (ii) Non-renewal of an Amendment 80 CQ permit; or

      (iii) Changes in the membership in an Amendment 80 cooperative, such as members joining or departing during the relevant year, or changes in the amount of Amendment 80 QS holdings of those members.

      (2)  Each Amendment 80 cooperative representative is responsible for submitting the cost recovery payment for Amendment 80 CQ landings made under the authority of its Amendment 80 CQ permit.

      (3) —(i)  An Amendment 80 cooperative representative must submit all Amendment 80 fee liability payment(s) to NMFS at the address provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the Amendment 80 CQ landings were made.

      (ii)  Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.

      (iii)  Submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form. Payments must be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  Instructions for electronic payment will be made available on both the payment Web site and a fee liability summary letter mailed to the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder.

      (iv)  Payment must be made electronically in U.S. dollars by automated clearing house, credit card, or electronic check drawn on a U.S. bank account.

      (b) —(1)  An Amendment 80 cooperative representative must use the Amendment 80 standard prices determined by NMFS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  Each year the Regional Administrator will publish _Amendment 80 standard prices_ in the  by December 1 of the year in which the Amendment 80 species landings were made. The standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per Amendment 80 equivalent pound for Amendment 80 species landings made by Amendment 80 CQ permit holders during the current calendar year.

      (ii)  The Amendment 80 standard prices published by NMFS will apply to all Amendment 80 species landings made by an Amendment 80 CQ permit holder during that calendar year.

      (iii)  NMFS will calculate the Amendment 80 standard prices for Amendment 80 species based on the following information:

      (A)  NMFS will use the standard prices calculated for Pacific cod based on information provided in the Pacific Cod Ex-vessel Volume and Value Report described at § 679.5(u)(1).

      (B)  () The Regional Administrator will base Amendment 80 standard prices for all Amendment 80 species other than Pacific cod on the First Wholesale Volume and Value reports specified in § 679.5(u)(2).

      () The Regional Administrator will establish Amendment 80 standard prices for all Amendment 80 species other than Pacific cod on an annual basis; except the Regional Administrator will establish a first Amendment 80 standard price for rock sole for all landings from January 1 through March 31, and a second Amendment 80 standard price for rock sole for all landings from April 1 through December 31.

      () The average first wholesale product prices reported on the First Wholesale Volume and Value reports, specified in § 679.5(u)(2), will be multiplied by 0.4 to obtain a proxy for the ex-vessel prices of Amendment 80 species other than Pacific cod.

      (c) —(1)  The _Amendment 80 fee percentage_ is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This amount will be announced by publication in the  in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This amount must not exceed 3.0 percent pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).

      (2)  Each year NMFS will calculate and publish the fee percentage according to the following factors and methodology:

      (i)  NMFS will use the following factors to determine the fee percentage:

      (A) The catch to which the Amendment 80 cost recovery fee will apply;

      (B) The ex-vessel value of that catch; and

      (C) The costs directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of the Amendment 80 Program.

      (ii)  NMFS will use the following equations to determine the fee percentage: 100 × DPC/V, where:

      (A) DPC = the direct program costs for the Amendment 80 Program for the most recent fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) with any adjustments to the account from payments received in the previous year.

      (B) V = total of the standard ex-vessel value of the landings subject to the Amendment 80 fee liability for the current year.

      (3) —(i)  NMFS will calculate and announce the Amendment 80 fee percentage in a  notice by December 1 of the year in which the Amendment 80 landings were made. NMFS will calculate the Amendment 80 fee percentage based on the calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  NMFS will apply the calculated Amendment 80 fee percentage to Amendment 80 CQ landings made between January 1 and December 31 of the same year.

      (4)  The Amendment 80 CQ permit holder must use the Amendment 80 fee percentage applicable at the time an Amendment 80 species landing is debited from an Amendment 80 CQ allocation to calculate the Amendment 80 fee liability for any retroactive payments for that Amendment 80 species.

      (5)  (i) Each Amendment 80 CQ permit holder will be subject to a fee liability for any Amendment 80 species CQ debited from an Amendment 80 CQ allocation between January 1 and December 31 of the current year.

      (ii) The Amendment 80 fee liability assessed to an Amendment 80 CQ permit holder will be based on the proportion of the standard ex-vessel value of Amendment 80 species debited from an Amendment 80 CQ permit holder relative to all Amendment 80 CQ permit holders during a calendar year as determined by NMFS.

      (iii) NMFS will provide a fee liability summary letter to each Amendment 80 CQ permit holder by December 1 of each year. The summary will explain the fee liability determination including the current fee percentage, and details of Amendment 80 species CQ pounds debited from Amendment 80 CQ allocations by permit, species, date, and prices.

      (d) —(1) No Amendment 80 cooperative will receive its Amendment 80 CQ until the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder submits full payment of an applicant's complete Amendment 80 fee liability.

      (2) If an Amendment 80 CQ permit holder fails to submit full payment for its Amendment 80 fee by the date described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:

      (i) At any time thereafter send an IAD to the Amendment 80 cooperative's representative stating that the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder's estimated fee liability, based on information submitted by the Amendment 80 cooperative's representative, is the Amendment 80 fee liability due from the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder.

      (ii) Disapprove any application to transfer Amendment 80 CQ to or from the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder in accordance with § 679.91(g).

      (3) If an Amendment 80 cooperative representative fails to submit full payment by the Amendment 80 fee payment deadline described at paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

      (i) The Regional Administrator will not issue a Amendment 80 CQ permit to that Amendment 80 cooperative for the following calendar year; and

      (ii) The Regional Administrator will not issue Amendment 80 CQ based on the Amendment 80 QS held by the members of that Amendment 80 cooperative to any other CQ permit for that calendar year.

      (4) Upon final agency action determining that an Amendment 80 CQ permit holder has not paid his or her Amendment 80 fee, the Regional Administrator may continue to not issue an Amendment 80 CQ permit for any subsequent calendar years until NMFS receives the unpaid fees. If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.

      (e)  Upon issuance of final agency action, payment submitted to NMFS in excess of the Amendment 80 fee determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the Amendment 80 cooperative unless the Amendment 80 cooperative's representative requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the Amendment 80 CQ permit holder's future Amendment 80 fee.

      (f)  An Amendment 80 cooperative representative who receives an IAD for incomplete payment of an Amendment 80 fee may appeal under the appeals procedures set out a 15 CFR part 906.

      (g)  Each year, NMFS will publish a report describing the Amendment 80 Cost Recovery Fee Program.

#### § § 679.118

      This section applies to vessels engaged in commercial fishing and recreational fishing for salmon in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area.

      (a) —(1)  NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will specify the annual TAC amounts for commercial fishing for each salmon stock or species after accounting for projected recreational fishing removals.

      (2)  The annual determinations of TAC for each salmon species or stock may be based on a review of the following:

      (i) Resource assessment documents prepared regularly for the Council that provide information on historical catch trends; updated estimates of the MSY of the salmon stocks or stock complexes; assessments of the stock condition of each salmon stock or stock complex; SSC recommendations on reference points established for salmon stocks; management uncertainty; assessments of the multispecies and ecosystem impacts of harvesting the salmon stocks at current levels, given the assessed condition of stocks, including consideration of rebuilding depressed stocks; and alternative harvesting strategies and related effects on the salmon species;

      (ii) Social and economic considerations that are consistent with Salmon FMP goals for the Cook Inlet EEZ Area, including the need to promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources, including minimizing costs; the desire to conserve, protect, and rebuild depleted salmon stocks; the importance of a salmon fishery to harvesters, processors, local communities, and other salmon users in Cook Inlet; and the need to promote utilization of certain species.

      (b) —(1)  (i) As soon as practicable after consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish proposed specifications for the salmon fishery in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area; and

      (ii) NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed specifications established by this section for a period specified in the notice of proposed specifications published in the .

      (2)  NMFS will consider comments received on the proposed specifications and will publish a notice of final specifications in the  unless NMFS determines that the final specifications would not be a logical outgrowth of the notice of proposed specifications. If the final specifications would not be a logical outgrowth of the notice of proposed specifications, NMFS will either:

      (i) Publish a revised notice of proposed specifications in the  for public comment, and after considering comments received on the revised proposed specifications, publish a notice of final specifications in the ; or

      (ii) Publish a notice of final specifications in the  without an additional opportunity for public comment based on a finding that good cause pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act justifies waiver of the requirement for a revised notice of proposed specifications and opportunity for public comment thereon.

      (c) —(1)  (i) For commercial fishing, if NMFS determines that any salmon TAC for commercial fishing as specified under paragraph (b) of this section has been or may be reached for any salmon species or stock, NMFS will publish notification in the  prohibiting commercial fishing for salmon in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area.

      (ii) For recreational fishing, if NMFS determines that any salmon ABC as specified under paragraph (b) of this section has been or may be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the  prohibiting retention of that salmon species when recreational fishing in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area and may also prohibit recreational fishing for one or more salmon species in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area. The Regional Administrator maintains the authority to open or close the Cook Inlet EEZ Area to recreational fishing for one or more salmon species if they deem it appropriate for conservation or other management purposes. Factors such as the ABC, anticipated harvest rates, expected mortality, and the number of participants will be considered in making any such determination.

      (d) —(1)  The MRA of an incidental catch species is calculated as a proportion of the basis species retained on board the vessel using the retainable percentages in table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories.

      (2)  (i) To calculate the MRA for a specific incidental catch species, an individual retainable amount must be calculated with respect to each basis species that is retained on board that vessel.

      (ii) To obtain these individual retainable amounts, multiply the appropriate retainable percentage for the incidental catch species/basis species combination, set forth in table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories, by the amount of the relevant basis species on board, in round-weight equivalents.

      (iii) The MRA for that specific incidental catch species is the sum of the individual retainable amounts for each basis species.

      (e) —(1)  Directed fishing for salmon using drift gillnet gear in the Cook Inlet EEZ Area may be conducted from 0700 hours, A.l.t., from the third Monday in June or June 19, whichever is later, through 1900 hours, A.l.t., August 15.

    Subpart L—Pacific Cod Trawl Cooperative Program

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 53735, Aug. 8, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

      § 679.130   Allocation, use, and transfer of PCTC Program QS permits.

#### § § 679.130

      (a)  (1) The PCTC Program applies to the Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel sector in the BSAI as defined at § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A).

      (2) The following fishing seasons apply to fishing under this subpart subject to other provisions of this part:

      (i) Fishing by vessels participating in a cooperative is authorized for the PCTC Program A season from 1200 hours, A.l.t., January 20 through 1200 hours, A.l.t., April 1.

      (ii) Fishing by vessels participating in a cooperative is authorized for the PCTC Program B season from 1200 hours, A.l.t., April 1 through 1200 hours, A.l.t., June 10.

      (iii) The PCTC Program does not apply to the Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel C season, as defined at § 679.23(e)(5)(ii)(C)().

      (b)  Pacific cod legal landings means the retained catch of Pacific cod caught using trawl gear in a management area in the BSAI by a catcher vessel during the directed fishing season for Pacific cod that:

      (1) Was made in compliance with State and Federal regulations in effect at that time; and

      (2) Was recorded on a State of Alaska fish ticket for shoreside deliveries or in observer data for mothership deliveries; and

      (3) Was the predominately retained species on the fishing trip; and

      (4) Was authorized by:

      (i) An LLP license and caught in the A or B season of a Federal or parallel groundfish fishery during the qualifying years 2009 through 2019; or

      (ii) An LLP license with a transferable AI endorsement prior to receiving the AI endorsement and was caught in a parallel fishery between January 20, 2004, and September 13, 2009; and

      (5) Was not made in a CDQ fishery; and

      (6) Was not made in a State of Alaska GHL fishery.

      (c)  NMFS will assign Pacific cod legal landings to an LLP license only if the qualifying Pacific cod legal landings of BSAI trawl catcher vessel Pacific cod were made under the authority of a fully transferable LLP license endorsed for BS or AI Pacific cod with a trawl gear designation from 2009 through 2019 or under the authority of an LLP license endorsed for Pacific cod with a trawl gear designation prior to earning a transferable AI endorsement from 2004 through September 13, 2009;

      (d)  (1) NMFS will assign Pacific cod legal landings to an LLP license in the form of PCTC Program QS only if the holder of the LLP license that authorized those landings submits a timely and complete application for PCTC Program QS under paragraph (h) of this section that is approved by NMFS.

      (2) NMFS will assign Pacific cod legal landings to an LLP license that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

      (3) NMFS will reissue LLP licenses to eligible harvesters that specify the number of PCTC Program QS units assigned to their LLP licenses.

      (e)  NMFS will assign legal landings to an eligible PCTC Program processor if the processor operates under the authority of either a valid FPP or FFP and holds an LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement, and received deliveries of legal landings of Pacific cod from the trawl catcher vessel sector from 2009 through 2019. A processor is ineligible to receive PCTC Program QS if it does not hold an active FFP or FPP as of September 7, 2023.

      (f)  (1) NMFS will assign Pacific cod processing history to a processor in the form of PCTC Program QS only if the FFP or FPP holder submits a timely and complete application for PCTC Program QS that is approved by NMFS pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.

      (2) NMFS will assign Pacific cod processing history based on legal landings delivered to a processor authorized by an FPP or FFP that meets the requirements of this section.

      (3) For the initial allocation of PCTC Program QS, qualifying processing history is attached to the processor at the time legal landings were received.

      (4) An eligible processor will be issued a PCTC Program QS permit that specifies the number of QS units assigned to that processor.

      (g)  (1) The PCTC Program official record will contain information used by the Regional Administrator to determine:

      (i) The amount of Pacific cod legal landings as defined at in this section assigned to an LLP license;

      (ii) The amount of Pacific cod processing history of legal landings as defined at § 679.130 assigned to an FPP or FFP;

      (iii) The amount of PCTC Program QS resulting from Pacific cod legal landings assigned to an LLP license held by an eligible harvester, or QS resulting from Pacific cod processing history assigned to an FPP or FFP held by an eligible processor;

      (iv) The amount of Pacific cod sideboard ratios assigned to LLP licenses;

      (v) Eligibility to participate in the PCTC Program; and

      (vi) QS assigned to PCTC Program participants.

      (2) The PCTC Program official record is presumed to be correct. An applicant participating in the PCTC Program has the burden to prove otherwise.

      (3) Only Pacific cod legal landings and processing history of legal landings, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, shall be used to establish an allocation of PCTC Program QS. Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to documentation of state or Federal catch reports that indicate the amount of Pacific cod harvested, the groundfish reporting area in which it was caught, the vessel and gear type used to catch it, and the date of harvesting, landing, or reporting.

      (h) —(1)  A person who wishes to receive QS to participate in the PCTC Program as an eligible harvester or an eligible processor must submit a timely and complete application for PCTC Program QS. An application form will be provided by NMFS or available from NMFS Alaska Region website as defined at § 679.2. The acceptable submittal methods will be described on the application form.

      (2)  A completed application for PCTC Program QS must be received by NMFS no later than 1700 hours, A.l.t., on October 10, 2023, or if sent by U.S. mail, postmarked by that time. Objective written evidence of timely application will be considered proof of a timely application.

      (3)  A timely and complete application must contain the information specified on the application for PCTC Program QS with all required documentation attached.

      (i) Additional required documentation for LLP license holders. Vessel names, ADF&G vessel registration numbers, and USCG documentation numbers of all vessels that fished under the authority of each LLP license, including dates when landings were made under the authority of an LLP license from 2009 through 2019 or under the authority of an LLP license prior to earning a transferable AI endorsement from 2004-2019;

      (ii) Additional required documentation for processors. Processor name, FFP or FPP number, and location of processing plant, including dates when landings were made under the authority of an LLP license from 2009 through 2019;

      (iii) The applicant must sign and date the application certifying under penalty of perjury that all information is true and correct. If the application is completed by a designated representative, then explicit authorization signed by the applicant must accompany the application.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate applications and compare all claims of catch history or processing history in an application with the information in the PCTC Program official record. Application claims that are consistent with information in the PCTC Program official record will be approved by the Regional Administrator. Application claims that are inconsistent with the PCTC Program official record will not be approved unless supported by documentation sufficient to substantiate such claims. An applicant who submits claims of catch history or processing history that are inconsistent with the official record without sufficient evidence, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section, will be provided a single 30-day evidentiary period to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify their claims of catch or processing history, or submit a revised application consistent with information in the PCTC Program official record. An applicant who claims catch or processing history that is inconsistent with information in the PCTC Program official record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct. Any claims that remain unsubstantiated after the 30-day evidentiary period will be denied. All applicants will be notified of NMFS's final application determinations by an initial administrative determination (IAD), which will inform applicants of their appeal rights under 15 CFR part 906.

      (5)  An applicant may appeal an IAD under the provisions in 15 CFR part 906.

      (i)  The Regional Administrator will assign PCTC Program QS only to an eligible harvester or eligible processor who submits a timely application for PCTC Program QS that is approved by NMFS.

      (1)  NMFS will assign a specific amount of PCTC Program QS units to each LLP license based on the Pacific cod legal landings of each LLP license using information from the PCTC Program official record according to the following procedures:

      (i) Determine the Pacific cod legal landings for each LLP license for each calendar year from 2009 through 2019.

      (ii) Select the 10 calendar years from the qualifying time period with the highest amount of legal landings for each LLP license, including years with zero metric tons if necessary.

      (iii) Sum the Pacific cod legal landings of the highest 10 years for each LLP license. This yields the PCTC Program QS units (in metric tons) for each LLP license.

      (2)  NMFS will assign a specific amount of PCTC Program QS units to each LLP license with a transferable AI endorsement based on the Pacific cod legal landings of each using information from the PCTC Program official record according to the following procedures:

      (i) Determine the Pacific cod legal landings for each LLP license with a transferable AI endorsement for each calendar year from 2004 through 2019.

      (ii) Select the fifteen calendar years that yield the highest amount of legal landings for each LLP license, including years with zero metric tons if necessary.

      (iii) Sum the Pacific cod legal landings of the highest fifteen years for each LLP license with transferable AI endorsement. This yields the PCTC Program QS units (in metric tons) for each LLP license with a transferable AI endorsement.

      (3)  The initial PCTC Program QS pool for all LLP licenses, with and without a transferable AI endorsement, is the sum of the sum of the PCTC Program QS units assigned to all LLP licenses in metric tons based on the PCTC Program official record as of December 31, 2022.

      (4)  NMFS will assign a specific amount of PCTC Program QS units to each eligible processor based on the Pacific cod legal landings delivered to each FPP or FFP using information from the PCTC Program official record according to the following procedures:

      (i) Sum the Pacific cod legal landings delivered to each FPP or FFP for each calendar year from 2009 through 2019;

      (ii) Select the ten calendar years that yield the highest amount of legal landings delivered to each FPP or FFP, including years with zero metric tons if necessary;

      (iii) Sum the Pacific cod legal landings of the highest 10 years for each FPP or FFP. This yields the QS units for each eligible processor, which will be specified on a PCTC Program QS permit for that processor;

      (iv) The PCTC Program QS pool for processors is the sum of all QS units assigned to processors in metric tons based on the PCTC official record as of December 31, 2022.

      (5)  Pacific cod legal landings are non-severable from the LLP license, transferable AI endorsement, or FPP to which those Pacific cod legal landings are assigned in the PCTC Program official record except under the following provisions:

      (i) If multiple LLP licenses authorized catch by a vessel, the LLP license holders must submit to NMFS an agreement specifying the amount of shared catch history to assign to each LLP license with the application for PCTC Program QS. In the absence of an agreement, the owner of the vessel that made the catch will assign qualifying catch history to each LLP license.

      (ii) For the LLP licenses associated with non-exempt AFA catcher vessels, within 90 days of initial issuance of PCTC Program QS, the owners of the LLP licenses that are associated with AFA non-exempt catcher vessels that engaged in fish transfer agreements during the qualifying periods may transfer PCTC Program QS to other LLP licenses associated with AFA non-exempt vessels, subject to the ownership cap at § 679.133.

      (A) NMFS will execute permanent transfers of PCTC Program QS between eligible LLP licenses during the 90-day transfer provision upon request. The transferor and transferee must show they agree to the one-time permanent transfer of PCTC Program QS, or show a transfer is authorized by an operation of law ( a court order). Requests to transfer PCTC Program QS must specify which LLP license is transferring PCTC Program QS, which LLP license is receiving PCTC Program QS, and the amount of PCTC Program QS to be transferred.

      (B) After the expiration of the 90-day transfer provision, PCTC Program QS will no longer be severable from the LLP license to which it is assigned unless authorized by the transfer rules specified in paragraph (j) or modification is supported by an operation of law.

      (j)  (1) Transfer of an LLP license with PCTC Program QS. A person may transfer an LLP license and the PCTC Program QS assigned to that LLP license under the provisions at § 679.4(k)(7), provided that the LLP license is not assigned PCTC Program QS in excess of the ownership cap specified at § 679.133 at the time of transfer.

      (2) Transfer of PCTC Program QS assigned to LLP licenses that exceeds PCTC Program QS ownership caps.

      (i) If an LLP license receives an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS that exceeds an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a), upon transfer of the LLP license, the LLP license holder may transfer the amount of PCTC Program QS in excess of the ownership cap separately from the LLP license and assign it to one or more LLP licenses. However, a transfer will not be approved by NMFS if that transfer would cause the receiving LLP license to exceed an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a).

      (ii) Prior to the transfer of an LLP license that received an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS that exceeds an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a), the LLP license holder must transfer the PCTC Program QS that is in excess of the ownership cap separately from that LLP license and assign it to one or more LLP licenses. On completion of the transfer of PCTC Program QS, the LLP license that was initially allocated an amount of PCTC Program QS in excess of the ownership cap may not exceed any ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a).

      (iii) Any PCTC Program QS associated with the LLP license that is in excess of the ownership cap may be assigned to another LLP license through the application used to transfer LLP licenses, and only if the application is approved as specified at § 679.4(k)(7).

      (iv) PCTC Program QS that is transferred from an LLP license that was initially allocated an amount of PCTC Program QS in excess of the ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a) and assigned to another LLP license may not be severed from the receiving LLP license.

      (3) Transfer of processor PCTC Program QS Permits. A person may transfer a PCTC Program QS permit to another processor with an active FPP issued under § 679.4. A transfer of processor-held PCTC Program QS may not cause the receiver of the permit to exceed the ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a) at the time of transfer. A PCTC Program QS permit held by a processor and associated QS may be transferred only if the application for transfer of PCTC Program QS permit is filled out entirely. A PCTC Program QS permit initially issued to an FFP holder may be transferred to a processor with an active FPP issued under § 679.4 or to a processor with an active FFP that authorizes a vessel named on an LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement.

      (4) Transfer of PCTC Program QS assigned to a processor-held PCTC Program QS permit that exceeds PCTC Program ownership caps.

      (i) If a PCTC Program QS permit receives an initial allocation of QS that exceeds an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a), the processor may transfer QS in excess of the ownership cap separately from that PCTC Program QS permit and assign it to the PCTC Program QS permit of one or more processors with an active FPP or FFP. However, a transfer will not be approved by NMFS if that transfer would cause the receiving processor to exceed an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a).

      (ii) Prior to the transfer of a PCTC Program QS permit that received an initial allocation of QS that exceeds an ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a), the permit holder must transfer the QS that is in excess of the ownership cap separately from that PCTC Program QS permit and assign it to one or more PCTC Program QS permits. On completion of the transfer of QS, the PCTC Program QS permit that was initially allocated an amount of QS in excess of the ownership cap may not exceed any ownership cap specified at § 679.133(a).

      (iii) Any QS associated with the PCTC Program QS permit held by a processor that is in excess of an ownership cap may be transferred only if the application for transfer of PCTC Program QS permit is filled out entirely.

      § 679.131   PCTC Program annual harvester privileges.

#### § § 679.131

      (a) —(1)  ( also § 679.4(q)). (i) Every calendar year, PCTC Program QS assigned to LLP licenses and PCTC Program QS permits held by a PCTC Program processor must be assigned to a PCTC Program cooperative through a CQ permit to use the CQ derived from that PCTC Program QS to catch Pacific cod, crab PSC, or halibut PSC assigned to the PCTC Program.

      (ii) NMFS will issue a CQ permit to a PCTC Program cooperative based on the aggregate PCTC Program QS of all LLP licenses and associated processors designated on an application for CQ that is approved by the Regional Administrator as described under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      (iii) Processors must associate with a PCTC Program cooperative for the PCTC Program QS assigned to that processor's PCTC Program QS permit to be issued to a PCTC Program cooperative as CQ.

      (2)  Any PCTC Program QS assigned to an LLP license or PCTC Program QS permit after NMFS has issued CQ for a calendar year will not result in any additional CQ being issued to a PCTC Program cooperative even if that QS holder has assigned their LLP license or PCTC Program QS permit to a PCTC Program cooperative for that calendar year.

      (3)  Failure to designate an LLP license with PCTC Program QS or a PCTC Program QS permit on a timely and complete application for CQ that is approved by the Regional Administrator as described under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, will result in the Regional Administrator not assigning that QS to a PCTC Program cooperative for the applicable calendar year.

      (4)  PCTC Program cooperatives must submit a complete application by November 1 to receive CQ that includes the following:

      (i) PCTC Program cooperative identification, including but not limited to the name of the cooperative and the taxpayer identification number;

      (ii) PCTC Program QS holders and ownership documentation;

      (iii) PCTC Program cooperative member vessels and LLP licenses;

      (iv) PCTC Program cooperative associated processors;

      (v) Vessels with FFPs on which the CQ issued to the PCTC Program cooperative will be used;

      (vi) Certification of cooperative representative;

      (vii) An attached copy of the membership agreement or contract that includes the following terms:

      (A) How the cooperative intends to harvest its CQ;

      (B) The obligations of QS holders who are members of a PCTC Program cooperative to ensure the full payment of PCTC Program fee liabilities that may be due;

      (C) How cooperatives monitor and report leasing activity in GOA fisheries; and

      (D) For a cooperative intending to harvest any amount of the CQ set-aside, the cooperative's plan for coordinating harvest and delivery of the CQ set-aside with an Aleutian Islands shoreplant as defined § 679.2.

      (viii) Each year, all cooperatives must establish an inter-cooperative agreement. This inter-cooperative agreement must be included as part of each annual cooperative application and is required before NMFS will issue CQ. The inter-cooperative agreement must establish how the cooperatives intend to harvest the CQ set-aside in years when it applies and ensure harvests in the BS do not exceed the minimum set-aside as specified at § 679.132(a)(4)(i). For the calendar year 2023, NMFS will allow each cooperative to submit the inter-cooperative agreement prior to December 31, 2023.

      (b) —(1)  Each calendar year, the Regional Administrator will determine the amount of the BSAI trawl catcher vessel sector's Pacific cod A and B season allocations that will be assigned to the PCTC Program as follows:

      (i)  For the A and B seasons, the Regional Administrator will establish an ICA to account for projected incidental catch of Pacific cod by trawl catcher vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish other than PCTC Program Pacific cod.

      (ii)  The remaining trawl catcher vessel sector's Pacific cod A and B season allocations are established as a DFA for the PCTC Program.

      (2) —(i)  NMFS will determine the Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel TAC in a calendar year in the annual harvest specification process at § 679.20.

      (ii)  The annual apportionment of Pacific cod in the A and B seasons between the PCTC Program DFA and the ICA in a given calendar year is established in the annual harvest specifications.

      (3) —(i)  NMFS will assign 77.5 percent of the PCTC Program DFA to the QS attached to LLP licenses assigned to PCTC Program cooperatives. Each LLP license's QS units will correspond to a portion of the DFA according to the following equation: (LLP license QS units/(sum of all LLP license QS units)) × (.775 × DFA).

      (ii)  NMFS will assign 22.5 percent of the PCTC Program DFA to the QS attached to PCTC Program QS permits assigned to PCTC Program cooperatives. Each QS permit's QS units will correspond to a portion of the DFA according to the following equation: (PCTC Program QS permit QS units/(sum of all PCTC Program QS permit QS units)) × (.225 × DFA).

      (4) —(i)  Annual CQ will be issued to each PCTC Program cooperative by NMFS based on the aggregate QS attached to LLP licenses and PCTC Program QS permits that are assigned to the cooperative. NMFS will issue CQ by A and B season and cooperatives will ensure the seasonal limits are not exceeded. Unused A season CQ may be rolled over to the B season. Annual CQ may be harvested from either BS or AI subareas subject to any limitations on BS harvest when the AI set-aside is in effect.

      (ii)  The amount of CQ that is issued to a PCTC Program cooperative is calculated according to the following formula:

      (iii)  A and B season trawl catcher vessel Pacific cod sector DFAs will be issued to PCTC Program cooperatives as CQ. Annual CQ for each PCTC cooperative will include separate A and B season CQ.

      (iv)  When in effect, the AI set-aside will be established annually as specified further at § 679.132.

      (c) —(1)  NMFS specifies the overall halibut PSC limit for the PCTC Program for each calendar year in the harvest specifications pursuant to the procedures specified at § 679.21(b). NMFS calculates the halibut PSC limit according to the formula described in this paragraph. NMFS assigns that halibut PSC limit to PCTC Program cooperatives pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

      (i) Multiply the halibut PSC limit apportioned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector's Pacific cod fishery category by 98 percent, which yields the halibut PSC apportioned to the trawl catcher vessel sector. The remaining 2 percent is apportioned to the AFA catcher/processor sector as specified at § 679.21(b)(4).

      (ii) Assign 95 percent of the trawl catcher vessel sector's halibut PSC limit to the A and B seasons and 5 percent to the C season.

      (iii) Each year after apportioning halibut PSC to the trawl catcher vessel sector for the A and B season, apply one of the following reductions to the A and B season trawl catcher vessel halibut PSC limit to determine the overall PCTC Program halibut PSC limit:

      (A) In the first year of the PCTC Program, reduce the A and B season halibut PSC limit by 12.5 percent.

      (B) In the second year, and each year thereafter, reduce the A and B season halibut PSC limit by 25 percent.

      (2)  For each calendar year, the amount of halibut PSC assigned to a cooperative is determined by the following procedure and the amount will be specified on the CQ permit:

      (i) Divide the amount of CQ units assigned to each PCTC Program cooperative by the amount of CQ allocated to all cooperatives. This yields the percentage of CQ units held by each cooperative.

      (ii) Multiply the overall PCTC Program halibut PSC limit by the percentage of the CQ assigned to a cooperative. This yields the amount of halibut PSC issued to that cooperative as CQ.

      (3)  Halibut PSC limits assigned to the CQ permit issued to a PCTC Program cooperative may only be used by the members of that PCTC Program cooperative while harvesting CQ in the BSAI. Any halibut PSC used by a cooperative must be deducted from the amount of halibut PSC on its CQ permit. Halibut PSC limits for cooperatives are not subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21. Halibut PSC limits are issued to the PCTC Program for the duration of the A and B seasons. Unused halibut PSC limits may be reapportioned to the C season.

      (d) —(1)  NMFS specifies the overall crab PSC limit for the PCTC Program for each calendar year in the harvest specifications pursuant to the procedures specified at § 679.21(e). NMFS calculates the crab PSC limit according to the formula described in this paragraph. NMFS then assigns that crab PSC limit to PCTC Program cooperatives with CQ pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

      (i) Multiply the crab PSC limit apportioned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector's Pacific cod fishery category by 90.6 percent, which yields the percentage of crab PSC apportioned to the trawl catcher vessel sector. The remaining 9.4 percent goes to the AFA catcher/processor sector as specified at § 679.21(b)(4).

      (ii) Assign 95 percent of the trawl catcher vessel sector's crab PSC limit to the A and B seasons and 5 percent to the C season.

      (iii) Reduce the A and B season trawl catcher vessel crab PSC limit by 35 percent to determine the overall PCTC Program crab PSC limit.

      (2)  For each calendar year, the amount of crab PSC limit assigned to a cooperative is determined by the following procedure and the amount will be specified on the CQ permit:

      (i) Divide the amount of CQ assigned to each PCTC Program cooperative by the total CQ assigned to all cooperatives. This yields the percentage of CQ held by that cooperative.

      (ii) Multiply the overall PCTC Program crab PSC limit by the percentage of the CQ pool assigned to a cooperative. This yields the crab PSC limit issued to that cooperative as CQ.

      (3)  Crab PSC limits assigned to the CQ permit issued to a PCTC Program cooperative may only be used by the members of that PCTC Program cooperative while harvesting CQ in the BSAI. Any crab PSC used by a cooperative must be deducted from the amount of crab PSC limit on its CQ permit. Crab PSC limits for cooperatives are not subject to seasonal apportionment under § 679.21. Crab PSC limits are issued to the PCTC Program for the duration of the A and B seasons. Unused crab PSC limits may be reapportioned to the C season.

      (e)  Halibut and crab PSC limits are transferable between cooperatives according to the same rules established for CQ in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (f)  The PCTC Program allocations are for directed fishing for Pacific cod by trawl catcher vessels. All groundfish species not allocated to PCTC Program cooperatives are managed to the maximum retainable amounts (MRAs), as described under § 679.20(e).

      (g)  If, after June 10, the Regional Administrator determines that reallocating a portion of the Pacific cod ICA or DFA from the PCTC Program to the BSAI trawl limited access sector C season is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may do so through notification in the  consistent with regulations at § 679.20(a)(7)(iii).

      (h)  If, after June 10, the Regional Administrator determines that reallocating a portion of the halibut or crab PSC limits from the PCTC Program to the BSAI trawl limited access sector C season is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may do so through notification in the  consistent with regulations at § 679.91(f)(4) and (5).

      (i)  NMFS will process an application through the NMFS online system for an inter-cooperative transfer of CQ, including PSC, provided that all information is completed by the transferor and transferee, with all applicable fields accurately filled in, and all required documentation is provided.

      (j) —(1)  This section governs the formation and operation of _PCTC Program cooperatives_. The regulations in this section apply only to PCTC Program cooperatives that have formed for the purpose of applying for and fishing with CQ issued annually by NMFS. PCTC Program cooperatives and cooperative members are responsible for ensuring the conduct of cooperatives is consistent with any relevant State or Federal antitrust laws. Membership in a cooperative is voluntary. No person may be required to join a cooperative. Any LLP license holder with PCTC Program QS may join a PCTC Program cooperative and assign their QS to that cooperative. Members may leave a cooperative, but any CQ derived from the QS held by that member will remain with that cooperative for the duration of the calendar year.

      (2)  A PCTC Program cooperative must meet the following legal and organizational requirements before it is eligible to receive CQ:

      (i) Each PCTC Program cooperative must be formed as a partnership, corporation, or other legal business entity that is registered under the laws of one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia;

      (ii) Each PCTC Program cooperative must appoint an individual as the designated representative to act on the cooperative's behalf and to serve as a contact point for NMFS for questions regarding the operation of the cooperative. The designated representative may be a member of the cooperative, or some other individual designated by the cooperative to act on its behalf;

      (iii) Each PCTC Program cooperative must submit a timely and complete application for CQ; and

      (iv) Each PCTC Program cooperative must meet the mandatory requirements established in paragraph (j)(3) of this section.

      (3)  The following table describes the necessary elements to form and operate a PCTC Program cooperative:

      (4)  If a member of a PCTC Program cooperative dies (in the case of an individual) or dissolves (in the case of a business entity), the CQ derived from the QS assigned to the cooperative for that year from that person remains under the control of the cooperative for the duration of that calendar year as specified in the cooperative contract. Each cooperative is free to establish its own internal procedures for admitting a successor-in-interest during the fishing season due to the death or dissolution of a cooperative member.

      § 679.132   Aleutian Islands CQ set-aside provisions in the PCTC Program.

#### § § 679.132

      (a) —(1)  Each year, during the annual harvest specifications process set forth at § 679.20(c), the Regional Administrator will specify the AI Pacific cod non-CDQ ICA, the DFA from the AI Pacific cod non-CDQ TAC, and the AI set-aside as follows:

      (2)  The AI Pacific cod non-CDQ ICA will be deducted from the aggregate portion of the AI Pacific cod non-CDQ TAC annually allocated to the non-CDQ sectors identified at § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A).

      (3)  The AI Pacific cod non-CDQ DFA will be the amount of the AI Pacific cod TAC remaining after subtraction of the AI Pacific cod CDQ reserve and the AI Pacific cod non-CDQ ICA.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator will specify the AI set-aside in either of the following ways:

      (i) When the AI DFA exceeds 12 percent of A season CQ, the AI set-aside is 12 percent of the PCTC Program A season CQ and is in effect during the A and B seasons.

      (ii) If the AI non-CDQ DFA is below 12 percent of the PCTC Program A season CQ, then the AI set-aside will be set equal to the AI non-CDQ DFA and is in effect during the A and B seasons. When the AI set-aside is in effect and set equal to the AI non-CDQ DFA, directed fishing for Pacific cod in the AI may only be conducted by PCTC Program vessels that deliver their catch of AI Pacific cod to an Aleutian Islands shoreplant. After June 10, the Regional Administrator may open directed fishing for AI non-CDQ Pacific cod for other sectors.

      (b) —(1)  The provisions of this section will apply if a representative of either the City of Adak or the City of Atka submits to the Regional Administrator a timely and complete notice of its intent to process PCTC Program Pacific cod during the upcoming fishing year.

      (2)  The notice of intent to process PCTC Program Pacific cod for the upcoming fishing year must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator by a representative of the City of Adak or the City of Atka no later than October 15 of each year in order for the provisions of this section to apply during the upcoming fishing year. Notices of intent to process received later than October 15 may not be accepted by the Regional Administrator.

      (3)  A notice of intent to process PCTC Program Pacific cod for the upcoming fishing year must contain the following information:

      (i) Date of submission,

      (ii) Name of city,

      (iii) Statement of intent to process PCTC Program Pacific cod,

      (iv) Identification of the fishing year during which the city intends to process PCTC Program Pacific cod,

      (v) Contact information for the representative of the city, and

      (vi) Documentation of authority to represent the City of Adak or the City of Atka.

      (4)  On or before November 30, the Regional Administrator will notify the representative of the City of Adak or the City of Atka, confirming receipt of their official notice of intent to process PCTC Program Pacific cod. Then, NMFS will announce through notification in the  whether the AI set-aside will be in effect for the upcoming fishing year.

      (5)  If the representative of the City of Adak or the City of Atka submits a timely and complete notice of intent to process in accordance of this section, then the following provisions will apply for the fishing year following the notice:

      (i) The PCTC Program cooperative(s) are required to set-aside an amount of CQ calculated by the Regional Administrator pursuant to (a)(4) of this section for delivery to an Aleutian Islands shoreplant as defined at § 679.2.

      (ii) All cooperatives must enter into an inter-cooperative agreement that describes how the AI set-aside will be administered by the cooperatives to ensure that the PCTC Program harvests from the BS do not exceed the minimum set-aside. This inter-cooperative agreement must establish how the cooperatives intend to harvest the AI set-aside when it applies. This inter-cooperative agreement must be provided as part of the annual PCTC Program cooperative application as specified at § 679.131(a)(4) and is required before NMFS can issue CQ.

      (iii) The inter-cooperative agreement must establish how cooperatives would ensure that trawl catcher vessels less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA assigned to an LLP license with a transferable AI trawl endorsement have the opportunity to harvest 10 percent of the AI set-aside for delivery to an Aleutian Islands shoreplant.

      (c)  (1) If the Regional Administrator has approved a notice of intent to process, vessels authorized under the PCTC Program shall not harvest the amount of the AI set-aside in the BS subarea.

      (2) PCTC Program cooperatives may not deliver more than the PCTC A season CQ minus the AI set-aside established under this section to processors in the BS subarea when the AI CQ set-aside is in effect.

      (3) The City of Adak or the City of Atka may withdraw their annual notice of intent to process prior to the end of B season.

      (4) The Regional Administrator may remove the delivery requirement for some or all of the projected unused AI CQ set-aside if the Regional Administrator determines that the Aleutian Islands shoreplants will not process the entire AI CQ set-aside.

      (5) In the event all notices of intent to process are withdrawn, the Regional Administrator will remove the delivery requirement for CQ that was set-aside for that calendar year.

      (6) To remove the AI CQ set-aside delivery requirement for that calendar year, the Regional Administrator will publish a document in the .

      (2)  A person may not individually or collectively own more than 5 percent of the PCTC Program QS initially assigned to harvesters unless that person qualifies for an exemption to this ownership cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section based on their qualifying catch history. Processor-issued QS does not count toward this ownership cap.

      (3)  A catcher vessel may not harvest an amount of CQ greater than 5 percent of the CQ issued to the PCTC Program during a calendar year unless that vessel qualifies for an exemption to this use cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section based on their qualifying catch history.

      (4)  A person may not individually or collectively own more than 20 percent of the PCTC Program QS initially assigned to processors unless that person qualifies for an exemption to this ownership cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section based on their qualifying processing history.

      (5)  A processor, at the firm or company level, may not process more than 20 percent of the CQ assigned to the PCTC Program during a calendar year unless that processor qualifies for an exemption to this use cap under paragraph (a)(6) of this section based on their qualifying processing history. The amount of CQ that is received by a PCTC Program processor is calculated based on the sum of all landings made with CQ received or processed by that processor and the CQ received or processed by any person affiliated with that processor as that term is defined at § 679.2.

      (6)  (i) A person may receive an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS in excess of the harvester ownership cap. This exemption is non-transferable.

      (iii) A vessel designated on an LLP license that received an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS in excess of the harvester ownership cap may harvest CQ in excess of the vessel use cap up to the amount of CQ resulting from QS assigned to the LLP license. This exemption is non-transferable.

      (iv)  A processor that received an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS in excess of the processor ownership cap may process more than 20 percent of CQ during a calendar year up to an amount of CQ proportional to the ratio of QS held by the processor to the total amount of QS held by processors. This exemption is non-transferable. An Aleutian Islands shoreplant is not subject to this processor use cap.

      (7)  An eligible harvester that receives an initial allocation of PCTC Program QS that exceeds the ownership cap listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not receive any PCTC Program QS by transfer unless and until the eligible harvester's holdings of PCTC Program QS in the PCTC Program are reduced to an amount below the use cap specified in this paragraph (a).

      (b)  The regulations in this section restrict the holders of LLP licenses issued PCTC Program QS from using the increased flexibility provided by the PCTC Program to expand their level of participation in GOA groundfish fisheries.

      (1)  LLP licenses that authorize AFA non-exempt catcher vessels will be subject to the sideboard limitations specified at § 679.64(b)(4)(i).

      (2)  A sideboard limit will be specified on each LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement. Each LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement may receive CQ deliveries from a catcher vessel not to exceed 125 percent of a catcher/processor's processing history as defined at § 679.130 and subject to eligibility requirements under BSAI FMP Amendment 120 to limit CPs acting as motherships.

If such a provision is included in the contract with the Formula Arbitrator, the Arbitration QS/IFQ Arbitration Organizations and the PQS/IPQ Arbitration Organizations must include a provision in the contract with the Formula Arbitrator to produce a Non-Binding Price Formula not later than June 30 for the crab QS fishery that was expected to remain closed but subsequently opens for fishing during the crab fishing year.

      (2) The contract with the Formula Arbitrator must specify that:

      (i) The Formula Arbitrator will conduct a single annual fleet-wide analysis of the markets for crab to establish a Non-Binding Price Formula under which a fraction of the weighted average first wholesale prices for crab products from the fishery may be used to set an ex-vessel price; and

      (ii) The Non-Binding Price Formula shall:

      (A) Be based on the historical distribution of first wholesale revenues between fishermen and processors in the aggregate based on arm's length first wholesale prices and ex-vessel prices, taking into consideration the size of the harvest in each year; and

      (B) Establish a price that preserves the historical division of revenues in the fishery while considering the following:

      () Current ex-vessel prices, including ex-vessel prices received for crab harvested under Class A, Class B, and CVC IFQ permits;

      () Consumer and wholesale product prices for the processing sector and the participants in arbitrations (recognizing the impact of sales to affiliates on wholesale pricing);

      () Innovations and developments of the harvesting and processing sectors and the participants in arbitrations (including new product forms);

      () Efficiency and productivity of the harvesting and processing sectors (recognizing the limitations on efficiency and productivity arising out of the management program structure);

      () Quality (including quality standards of markets served by the fishery and recognizing the influence of harvest strategies on the quality of landings);

      () The interest of maintaining financially healthy and stable harvesting and processing sectors;

      () Safety and expenditures for ensuring adequate safety;

      () Timing and location of deliveries; and

      () The cost of harvesting and processing less than the full IFQ or IPQ allocation (underages) to avoid penalties for overharvesting IFQ and a mechanism for reasonably accounting for deadloss.

      (C) Include identification of various relevant factors such as product form, delivery time, and delivery location.

      (D) Consider the “highest arbitrated price” for the fishery from the previous crab fishing season, where the “highest arbitrated price” means the highest arbitrated price for arbitrations of IPQ and Arbitration IFQ which represent a minimum of at least 7 percent of the IPQ resulting from the PQS in that fishery. For purposes of this process, the Formula Arbitrator may aggregate up to three arbitration findings to collectively equal a minimum of 7 percent of the IPQ. When arbitration findings are aggregated with 2 or more entities, the lesser of the arbitrated prices of the arbitrated entities included to attain the 7 percent minimum be considered for the highest arbitrated price.

      (iii) The Non-Binding Price Formula may rely on any relevant information available to the Formula Arbitrator, including, but not limited to,

      (A) Information provided by the QS, PQS, IPQ and IFQ holders in the fishery, and

      (B) The Market Report for the fishery.

      (iv) The Formula Arbitrator:

      (A) May meet with IFQ holders who are members of any single FCMA cooperative collectively;

      (B) Shall meet with IPQ holders individually;

      (C) Shall meet with distinct FCMA cooperatives individually; and

      (D) Shall meet with IFQ holders who are not members of the same FCMA cooperative individually.

      (v) The Formula Arbitrator may request any relevant information from QS, PQS, IPQ, and IFQ holders in the fishery, but the Formula Arbitrator shall not have subpoena power.

      (vi) The Formula Arbitrator may obtain information from persons other than QS, PQS, IPQ, and IFQ holders in the fishery, if those persons agree to provide such data. Any information that is provided must be based on activities occurring more than three months prior to the date of submission to the Formula Arbitrator.

      (vii) The Formula Arbitrator shall keep confidential the information that is not publicly available and not disclose the identity of the persons providing specific information.

      (viii) (A) In 2005, the non-binding price formula shall be produced not later than September 30, 2005 or 25 days prior to the first crab fishing season for that crab QS fishery whichever is later in that crab fishing year as required under this section.

      (B) In all subsequent years and except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the Non-Binding Price Formula must be produced not later than 50 days prior to the first crab fishing season for that crab QS fishery, except that the Non-Binding Price Formulas for the western Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery and the eastern Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery must be produced not later than 30 days prior to the first crab fishing season for those crab QS fisheries.

      (C) The contract with the Formula Arbitrator must specify that the Formula Arbitrator will provide the non-binding price formula in that crab fishing year to:

      () Each Arbitration Organization in that fishery;

      () NMFS in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

      () The Market Analyst and all Contract Arbitrators in the fishery.

      (ix) The Formula Arbitrator shall not disclose any information to any person unless required under this section.

      (h) —(1)  For each crab QS fishery, the Arbitration QS/IFQ Arbitration Organizations and PQS/IPQ Arbitration Organizations shall establish a contract with all Contract Arbitrators in that fishery that specifies that each Contract Arbitrator may be selected to resolve a dispute concerning the terms of delivery, price, or other factors in the fishery.

      (2)  The contract with the Contract Arbitrator shall specify the means by which the Contract Arbitrator will be selected to resolve specific disputes. This contract must specify that for any dispute for which the Contract Arbitrator is selected, the Contract Arbitrator will comply with the last best offer arbitration method as set forth in this section.

      (3)  The contract with the Contract Arbitrator(s) shall specify the following approaches for negotiation and Binding Arbitration among members of the Arbitration Organizations:

      (i)  An IFQ and an IPQ holder may negotiate individually. Groups of IFQ holders may negotiate collectively with an IPQ holder only under the following provisions:

      (A) Members of an FCMA cooperatives may participate collectively with other members of the same FCMA cooperative in Binding Arbitration except as otherwise provided under this section.

      (B) Members of different FCMA cooperatives shall not participate collectively in Binding Arbitration.

      (C) IPQ holders shall not participate collectively. Only one IPQ holder shall enter into Binding Arbitration with any IFQ holder or IFQ holder(s).

      (D) An Arbitration Organization must not negotiate on behalf of a member. This shall not prohibit the members of an Arbitration IFQ Arbitration Organization from negotiation if the Arbitration Organization qualifies as an FCMA cooperative.

      (ii)  At any time prior to the date of the first crab fishing season of a crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery, any holder of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may negotiate with any holder of uncommitted IPQ, the price and delivery terms for that season for any uncommitted IFQ and uncommitted IPQ.

      (A) Uncommitted Arbitration IFQ holders and Uncommitted IPQ holders may freely contact each other and initiate open negotiations.

      (B) If Arbitration IFQ holders and IPQ holders do not reach an agreement on price, delivery terms, or other terms after committing shares, an Arbitration IFQ holder may initiate Binding Arbitration in accordance with the procedures specified in this section in order to resolve disputes in those price, delivery terms, or other terms.

      (C) Once IFQ or IPQ has been committed, the IFQ holder and IPQ holder cannot engage in open negotiation using those shares.

      (iii)  (A) Prior to the date of the first crab fishing season for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year a committed IPQ holder and one or more committed Arbitration IFQ holders may choose to adopt a Lengthy Season approach. The Lengthy Season approach is an alternative method to the Binding Arbitration proceedings.

      (B) A Lengthy Season approach allows a committed IPQ holder and a committed Arbitration IFQ holder to agree to postpone negotiation of specific contract terms until a time during the crab fishing year as agreed upon by the Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder participating in the negotiation. The Lengthy Season approach allows the Arbitration IFQ holders and IPQ holder involved in the negotiation to postpone Binding Arbitration, if necessary, until a time during the crab fishing year. If the parties ready a final agreement on the contract terms, Binding Arbitration is not necessary.

      (C) If a committed IPQ holder and one or more committed Arbitration IFQ holder(s) are unable to reach an agreement on whether to adopt a Lengthy Season approach, they may request mediation to assist the parties in determining whether to adopt a Lengthy Season approach. The parties may request a Contract Arbitrator to act as a mediator. If the mediation proves unsuccessful or is not selected, the Arbitration IFQ holder may initiate enter Binding Arbitration to determine whether to adopt a lengthy season approach.

      () Binding Arbitration may begin immediately with the same Contract Arbitrator.

      () If the Contract Arbitrator serves as a mediator in an unsuccessful mediation, either party may request another Contract Arbitrator for the Binding Arbitration.

      (iv)  (A) At any time 120 hours (five days) after NMFS issues IFQ and IPQ for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year, holders of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may choose to commit the delivery of harvests of crab to be made with that uncommitted Arbitration IFQ to an uncommitted IPQ holder. The issuance of IFQ and IPQ for a crab QS fishery occurs on the time and date that IFQ and IPQ amounts for that crab QS fishery are posted on the NMFS, Alaska Region website at

      (B) To commit Arbitration IFQ, the holder of uncommitted IFQ must offer an amount of Arbitration IFQ:

      () Not less than 50 percent of the Arbitration IFQ holder's total uncommitted Arbitration IFQ, or an amount of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ equal to the total amount of uncommitted IPQ available, whichever is less, if the Arbitration IFQ holder is not an FCMA cooperative; and

      () Not less than _2_5 percent of the Arbitration IFQ holder's total uncommitted Arbitration IFQ, or an amount of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ equal to the total amount of uncommitted IPQ available, whichever is less, if the Arbitration IFQ holder is an FCMA cooperative.

      (C) Any holder of uncommitted IPQ must accept all proposed Arbitration IFQ commitments, up to the amount of its uncommitted IPQ. The commitment of IPQ will take place on receipt of notice from the holder of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ of the intention to commit that IFQ.

      (D) After matching, an Arbitration IFQ holder and an IPQ holder may decide to enter mediation to reach agreement on contract terms. The Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder may request a Contract Arbitrator to act as a mediator to facilitate an agreement.

      () If the mediation proves unsuccessful, or if mediation is not selected, the Arbitration IFQ holder may initiate Binding Arbitration which may begin immediately with the same Contract Arbitrator.

      () If the Contract Arbitrator serves as a mediator in an unsuccessful mediation, the Arbitration IFQ holder may request another Contract Arbitrator for the Binding Arbitration.

      (v)  If an Arbitration IFQ holder intends to initiate Binding Arbitration, the Arbitration IFQ holder must initiate the Binding Arbitration procedure not later than 360 hours (15 days) after NMFS issues IFQ and IPQ for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year. Binding Arbitration is initiated after the committed Arbitration IFQ holder notifies a committed IPQ holder and selects a Contract Arbitrator. Binding Arbitration may be initiated to resolve price, terms of delivery, and other disputes. There will be only one Binding Arbitration Proceeding for an IPQ holder but multiple Arbitration IFQ holders may participate in this proceeding. This limitation on the timing of Binding Arbitration proceedings does not include proceedings that arise due to:

      (A) The lengthy season approach;

      (B) Performance disputes; and

      (C) Quality disputes.

      (vi)  Any uncommitted Arbitration IFQ holder may join a Binding Arbitration proceeding as a party by committing the shares to the arbitration and providing notice to the IPQ holder and the Contract Arbitrator(s). An Arbitration IFQ holder may join a Binding Arbitration proceeding only if uncommitted IPQ is available. Once shares are committed to a Binding Arbitration Proceeding they cannot be uncommitted. The contract with the Contract Arbitrator may specify the terms and timing of joining the proceedings.

      (vii)  The Contract Arbitrator shall meet with all parties to a Binding Arbitration proceeding as soon as possible once a Binding Arbitration proceeding has been initiated for the sole purpose of establishing a schedule for the Binding Arbitration. This schedule shall include the date by which the IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) must submit their last best offer and any supporting materials, and any additional meetings or mediation if agreed to by all parties. This meeting will discuss the schedule of the Binding Arbitration proceedings and not address terms of last best offers.

      (viii)  The Contract Arbitrator will meet with the parties to the Binding Arbitration proceeding to determine the matters that must be included in the last best offer, which may include a fixed price or a price over a time period specified by the parties, a method for adjusting prices over a crab fishing year, or an advance price paid at the time of delivery.

      (ix)  The parties to a Binding Arbitration proceeding shall each submit to the Contract Arbitrator(s) a last best offer defining all the terms specified for inclusion in a last best offer by the Contract Arbitrator. An Arbitration IFQ holder that is an FCMA cooperative may submit a last best offer that defines terms for the delivery of crab harvested by members of that FCMA cooperative with IFQ held by the cooperative. An Arbitration IFQ holder that is not an FCMA cooperative may submit a last best offer that defines the term of delivery of crab harvested with IFQ held by that person. The IPQ holder that is a party to the proceeding shall submit a single offer that defines terms for delivery of crab harvested with all IFQ that are subject to the proceedings.

      (x)  The Contract Arbitrator(s) shall decide among each offer received from an Arbitration IFQ holder and the offer received from the IPQ holder. Each arbitration decision shall result in a binding contract between the IPQ holder and the Arbitration IFQ holder defined by the terms of the offer selected by Contract Arbitrator(s). An arbitration decision applies to all committed IFQ and committed IPQ in that arbitration.

      (xi)  (A) If last best offers are submitted at least 15 days before the first crab fishing season for that crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery, arbitration decisions shall be issued no later than 10 days before the first crab fishing season for that crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery. Otherwise, the Contract Arbitrator will notify the parties of the arbitration decision within 5 days of the parties submitting their last best offers.

      (B) The Contract Arbitrator will notify the parties by providing each Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder that is a party to the Binding Arbitration proceeding, a copy of any decision. The decision is binding on the parties to the Binding Arbitration proceeding.

      (4)  The contract with the Contract Arbitrator shall specify that the Contract Arbitrator will be subject to the following provisions when deciding which last best offer to select.

      (i) The Contract Arbitrator's decision shall:

      (A) Be based on the historical distribution of first wholesale revenues between fishermen and processors in the aggregate based on arm's length first wholesale prices and ex-vessel prices, taking into consideration the size of the harvest in each year; and

      (B) Establish a price that preserves the historical division of revenues in the fishery while considering the following:

      () Current ex-vessel prices, including ex-vessel prices received for crab harvested under Class A IFQ, Class B IFQ, and CVC IFQ permits;

      () Consumer and wholesale product prices for the processing sector and the participants in the arbitration (recognizing the impact of sales to affiliates on wholesale pricing);

      () Innovations and developments of the harvesting and processing sectors and the participants in the arbitration (including new product forms);

      () Efficiency and productivity of the harvesting and processing sectors (recognizing the limitations on efficiency and productivity arising out of the management program structure);

      () Quality (including quality standards of markets served by the fishery and recognizing the influence of harvest strategies on the quality of landings);

      () The interest of maintaining financially healthy and stable harvesting and processing sectors;

      () Safety and expenditures for ensuring adequate safety;

      () Timing and location of deliveries; and

      () The cost of harvesting and processing less than the full IFQ or IPQ allocation (underages) to avoid penalties for overharvesting IFQ and a mechanism for reasonably accounting for deadloss.

      (C) Consider the Non-Binding Price Formula established in the fishery by the Formula Arbitrator.

      (ii) The Contract Arbitrator's decision may rely on any relevant information available to the Contract Arbitrator, including, but not limited to:

      (A) Information provided by the QS, PQS, IPQ and IFQ holders in the fishery regarding the factors identified in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section; and

      (B) The Market Report for the fishery.

      (iii) Each of the Arbitration IFQ holders and the IPQ holders that is party to the proceeding may provide the Contract Arbitrator with additional information to support its last best offer. The Contract Arbitrator must receive and consider all data submitted by the parties.

      (iv) The Contract Arbitrator may request specific information from the Arbitration IFQ holder(s) and IPQ holder that will be useful in reaching a final decision. The Contract Arbitrator will not have subpoena power and it is in the sole discretion of the person from whom information is requested as to whether to provide the requested information.

      (5)  The parties to a Binding Arbitration proceeding shall be precluded from full access to the information provided to the Contract Arbitrator.

      (i) Arbitration IFQ holders that are party to an arbitration proceeding shall have access only to information provided directly by the IPQ holder to the Contract Arbitrator for that Binding Arbitration proceeding.

      (ii) IPQ holders that are party to an arbitration proceeding shall have access only to information provided directly by an Arbitration IFQ holder to the Contract Arbitrator for that Binding Arbitration proceeding.

      (iii) The Contract Arbitrator shall keep confidential the information provided by any QS, PQS, IFQ, or IPQ holders in the fishery and not disclose the identity of the persons providing specific information except as provided in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.

      (iv) The Arbitration IFQ holders and IPQ holders shall not release information received in a Binding Arbitration proceeding to persons who were not party to that Binding Arbitration proceeding other than the final result of that arbitration proceeding except as provided for in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.

      (6)  The Contract Arbitrator must provide any information, documents, or data required under this paragraph to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section not later than 30 days prior to the end of the crab fishing year for which the open negotiation or arbitration applied. The contract with the Contract Arbitrator must specify that the Contract Arbitrator provide NMFS with:

      (i) A copy of any minutes from any meeting attended by that Contract Arbitrator between or among any PQS or IPQ holders concerning any negotiations under this section;

      (ii) Any last-best offers made during the Binding Arbitration process, including all contract details, the names of other participants in the arbitration, and whether the bid was accepted by the Contract Arbitrator; and

      (iii) A copy of any information, data, or documents given by the Contract Arbitrator to any person who is not a party to the particular arbitration for which that information was provided. The Contract Arbitrator must identify the arbitration to which the information, data, or documents apply, and the person to whom those information, data, or documents were provided.

      (7)  The decision of the Contract Arbitrator for Binding Arbitration shall be enforced among the parties to that arbitration.

      (8)  Except as provided for in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, the failure of a Contract Arbitrator to perform shall be enforced by the Arbitration Organizations.

      (9)  (i) An Arbitration IFQ holder with uncommitted IFQ, may opt-in to any contract that results from a completed a Binding Arbitration procedure with any IPQ holder that has uncommitted IPQ.

      (A) All the terms from the arbitrated contract will apply. The Contract Arbitrator may determine fees and a time frame by which a Post Binding Arbitration opt-in may occur if those terms are not specified in the arbitrated contract.

      (B) Once exercised, the opt-in results in a contract that is binding on both the Arbitration IFQ and IPQ holder.

      (ii) To initiate the opt-in process, the holder of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ will notify the holder of uncommitted IPQ in writing of its intent to opt-in.

      (iii) Holders of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may opt-in to a contract resulting from a completed Binding Arbitration procedure with a person that holds uncommitted IPQ for that fishery.

      (iv) If the IPQ holder and the Arbitration IFQ holder are unable to resolve a dispute regarding whether the opt-in offer is consistent with the original contract from the completed Binding Arbitration procedure, the dispute may be decided by the Contract Arbitrator to the original arbitration that resulted in the contract to which the Arbitration IFQ holder is seeking to opt-in. The Contract Arbitrator will decide only whether the proposed opt-in terms are consistent with the original contract.

      (10)  If an IPQ holder and an Arbitration IFQ holder are unable to resolve disputes regarding the obligations to perform specific contract provisions after substantial negotiations or when time is of the essence, the issues of that dispute shall be submitted for Binding Arbitration before a Contract Arbitrator for that fishery.

      (i) Binding Arbitration resulting from a performance dispute can occur at any point during or after the crab fishing year. The dispute must be raised by the IPQ holder or the Arbitration IFQ holder. Arbitration of that performance dispute must be initiated prior to the date of the first crab fishing season for the following crab fishing year in that crab QS fishery.

      (ii) Performance dispute arbitration shall follow the applicable procedures described for a Binding Arbitration in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, except that the time frame for the procedure applicable to a performance dispute will be determined by the Contract Arbitrator once the dispute has been raised.

      (iii) If a party fails to abide by the arbitration decision, a party may pursue available contract remedies.

      (iv) The costs of arbitrating performance disputes shall be provided from the general fees collected by the Arbitration Organizations pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

      (v) The Contract Arbitrator may assign fees to any party bringing frivolous complaints. Any such fees shall be paid by the party and not from the fees collected under paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section.

      (11)  When disputes regarding the quality of the harvested crab arise within the context of an existing contract, the parties may settle the disputes within the context of the arbitration system according to the following:

      (i) In cases where the IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) have agreed to a formula-based price for crab but where they cannot reach an agreement on the quality and price of the crab, the IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) will receive their share of the value of the amount of crab delivered based on the provisions of the contract.

      (ii) In quality disputes where the Arbitration IFQ holders prefer to use actual ex-vessel price and not a formula-based price and a dispute arises regarding crab quality and price, the dispute should be referred to a mutually agreeable independent quality specialist firm. This independent quality specialist firm will determine the quality of the crab. This information will be used as the basis for subsequent price determinations. The IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) with this quality dispute shall share the cost of hiring the specialist firm and agree to abide by its findings according to the terms of their agreement.

      (i)  The Arbitration Organizations, Market Analyst, Contract Arbitrator, Formula Arbitrator, and the Third Party Data Provider are authorized to adopt arbitration system procedures and make administrative decisions, including additional provisions in the various contracts, provided those actions are not inconsistent with any other provision in the regulations.

      § 680.21   Crab harvesting cooperatives.

#### § § 680.21

      This section governs the formation and operation of crab harvesting cooperatives. The regulations in this section apply only to crab harvesting cooperatives that have formed for the purpose of applying for and fishing under a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit issued by NMFS. Members of crab harvesting cooperatives that are not FCMA cooperatives should consult counsel before commencing any activity if the members are uncertain about the legality under the antitrust laws of the crab harvesting cooperative's proposed conduct.

      (a)  The following requirements apply to the formation of crab harvesting cooperatives.

      (1)  A crab harvesting cooperative is limited to QS holders that hold any amount of CPO, CVO, CPC, or CVC QS, and that NMFS has determined are eligible to receive crab IFQ.

      (i)  Each crab harvesting cooperative must include at least four unique QS holding entities. A unique QS holding entity is a QS holder or group of affiliated QS holders that are not affiliated with any other QS holders or QS holding entities in the crab harvesting cooperative. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “affiliation” is defined at § 680.2.

      (ii)  Membership in a crab harvesting cooperative is voluntary. No person may be required to join a crab harvesting cooperative, and no crab harvesting cooperative may be required to accept a member who the crab harvesting cooperative chooses not to accept.

      (iii)  (A) A QS holder may join one crab harvesting cooperative per CR fishery.

      (B) Upon joining a crab harvesting cooperative for a CR fishery, NMFS will convert all of a QS holder's QS holdings for that CR fishery to crab harvesting cooperative IFQ.

      (2)  A crab harvesting cooperative must meet the following legal and organizational requirements before it is eligible to apply for a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit:

      (i)  Each crab harvesting cooperative must be formed as a partnership, corporation, or other legal business entity that is registered under the laws of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia.

      (ii)  Each crab harvesting cooperative must appoint an individual as designated representative to act on the crab harvesting cooperative's behalf and serve as contact point for NMFS for questions regarding the operation of the crab harvesting cooperative. The designated representative may be a member of the crab harvesting cooperative or some other individual authorized by the crab harvesting cooperative to act on its behalf.

      (b)  A crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit is an annual permit issued to a crab harvesting cooperative that establishes an annual catch limit of crab that is based on the collective QS holdings of the members of the crab harvesting cooperative that have been contributed by the members. A crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit will list the IFQ amount, by fishery, held by the crab harvesting cooperative and identify the members of the crab harvesting cooperative. Each crab harvesting cooperative will be issued a separate IFQ permit for each type of QS held by a member (or members) of the crab harvesting cooperative.

      (1)  A completed Application for Annual Crab Harvesting Cooperative Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Permit listing the name of each member of the crab harvesting cooperative must be submitted annually by each crab harvesting cooperative and received by NMFS no later than June 15 (or postmarked by this date, if sent via U.S. mail or a commercial carrier) for the upcoming crab fishing year for which the crab harvesting cooperative is applying to receive IFQ. If a complete application is not received by NMFS by this date, or postmarked by this date, the crab harvesting cooperative will not receive IFQ for the upcoming crab fishing year. In the event that NMFS has not received a complete and timely application by June 15, NMFS will presume that the application was timely filed if the applicant can provide NMFS with proof of timely filing. Each crab harvesting cooperative member is responsible for submitting a completed Application for Annual Crab Individual Fishing Quota Permit to NMFS by June 15 pursuant to § 680.4.

      (2)  A complete application must contain the following information:

      (i)  Enter the crab harvesting cooperative's legal name; type of business entity under which the crab harvesting cooperative is organized; state in which the crab harvesting cooperative is legally registered as a business entity; printed name of the crab harvesting cooperative's designated representative; the permanent business address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address (if available) of the crab harvesting cooperative or its designated representative; and the signature of the crab harvesting cooperative's designated representative and date signed.

      (ii)  Full name and NMFS Person ID of each member of the crab harvesting cooperative.

      (iii)  For the application to be considered complete, the following documents must be attached to the application: the completed and signed annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ permit for all members of the crab harvesting cooperative, a copy of the business license issued by the state in which the crab harvesting cooperative is registered as a business entity, a copy of the articles of incorporation or partnership agreement of the crab harvesting cooperative, and a copy of the crab harvesting cooperative agreement signed by the members of the crab harvesting cooperative (if different from the articles of incorporation or partnership agreement of the crab harvesting cooperative).

      (3)  Upon receipt of a completed application for an annual crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit that is subsequently approved, NMFS will issue one-year crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permits to the crab harvesting cooperative. The crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permits will list the crab IFQ amounts that are generated by the aggregate QS holdings of all members of the crab harvesting cooperative for each fishery, region, sector, and Class A/B IFQ categories. Issuance by NMFS of a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit is not a determination that the crab harvesting cooperative is formed or is operating in compliance with antitrust law.

      (4)  A crab harvesting cooperative or person that is adversely affected by an initial administrative determination (IAD) that is associated with the issuance of a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit may appeal the IAD using the appeals procedures described in § 680.43.

      (c)  The following restrictions govern fishing for IFQ crab under a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit:

      (1)  A copy of a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit must be maintained on board any vessel that is being used to harvest crab under the permit.

      (2)  The only person eligible to harvest crab under a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit is the crab IFQ hired master under § 680.4(g) who is operating a vessel in which at least a 10 percent ownership share is held by a member of the crab harvesting cooperative to whom the IFQ permit is issued.

      (3)  Each member of a crab harvesting cooperative is responsible for ensuring that members of the crab harvesting cooperative and crab IFQ hired masters of the crab harvesting cooperative comply with all regulations applicable to fishing for CR crab.

      (d)  The following requirements address transfers of QS and IFQ by members of a crab harvesting cooperative.

      (1)  A member of a crab harvesting cooperative may acquire or divest QS at any time in accordance with the transfer procedures in § 680.41. However, transfers of QS that occur after the June 15 deadline for crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit applications will not be reflected in the type or amount of IFQ permit issued to the crab harvesting cooperative for that crab fishing year.

      (2)  A member of a crab harvesting cooperative may acquire or divest individually held IFQ using the transfer procedures described in § 680.41. However, any vessel used to harvest IFQ not held by a crab harvesting cooperative loses the vessel use cap exemption.

      (3)  A member of a crab harvesting cooperative may not acquire or divest crab harvesting cooperative IFQ. Crab harvesting cooperative IFQ may only be transferred between two crab harvesting cooperatives.

      (e)  The following requirements address transfers of QS, IFQ, PQS, and IPQ by crab harvesting cooperatives that have been issued crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permits.

      (1)  A crab harvesting cooperative that has been issued a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit is prohibited from acquiring any amount of QS, PQS, or IPQ for the valid duration of the crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit. A crab harvesting cooperative that acquires any amount of QS, PQS, or IPQ becomes ineligible to receive a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit.

      (2)  A crab harvesting cooperative may transfer its IFQ only to another crab harvesting cooperative. Crab harvesting cooperatives wishing to engage in an inter-cooperative transfer must complete an application for inter-cooperative transfer to transfer crab IFQ between crab harvesting cooperatives. A crab harvesting cooperative is prohibited from transferring any amount of crab harvesting cooperative IFQ to any entity that is not a crab harvesting cooperative operating under a crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit.

      (3)  Inter-cooperative transfers of IFQ will apply to the individual use caps of crab harvesting cooperative members through the designation of the crab harvesting cooperative members conducting the transfer.

      (f) —(1)  NMFS will process an application for transfer of crab harvesting cooperative individual fishing quota (IFQ) provided that a paper or electronic request form is completed by the applicant, with all applicable fields accurately filled in, and all required additional documentation is attached.

      (2) —(i)  The transferor's designated representative must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete. The transferor's designated representative must submit the paper application as indicated on the application.

      (ii)  The transferor's designated representative must log into the system and create a transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferor's NMFS ID, password, and Transfer Key and submitting the transfer request, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (3) —(i)  The transferee's designated representative must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (ii)  The transferee's designated representative must log into the system and accept the transfer request as indicated on the computer screen. By using the transferee's NMFS ID, password, and Transfer Key, the designated representative certifies that all information is true, correct, and complete.

      (4)  An application for transfer of crab harvesting cooperative IFQ crab QS or PQS may be submitted to NMFS as instructed on the application. Forms are available on the NMFS Alaska Region website at , or by contacting NMFS at 800-304-4846, Option 2.

      (g)  The following requirements address inseason changes to crab harvesting cooperative membership.

      (1)  A crab harvesting cooperative may add a new member if that person becomes eligible to join the crab harvesting cooperative through the acquisition of any amount of the QS upon which the crab harvesting cooperative's annual IFQ permit was based, provided that the person acquiring the QS in question has been determined by NMFS to be eligible to hold IFQ. Likewise, a crab harvesting cooperative may remove a member if that person no longer holds any of the QS upon which the crab harvesting cooperative's annual IFQ permit was based.

      (2)  A crab harvesting cooperative is not required to add or remove members during the fishing season to reflect inseason transfers of QS. Each crab harvesting cooperative is free to establish its own process for deciding whether or not to admit new members or to remove existing members during the fishing season to reflect changes in the QS holdings. No crab harvesting cooperative is required to admit a new QS holder that the crab harvesting cooperative chooses not to admit, regardless of whether the person in question has acquired any amount of QS upon which the crab harvesting cooperative's annual IFQ is based. If a crab harvesting cooperative chooses to make inseason membership changes, then it must comply with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

      (3)  To change crab harvesting cooperative membership, a crab harvesting cooperative must submit to NMFS a revised application for an annual crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit together with any revised supporting documents that are required to be submitted with the application. The revised application for an annual crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit must be accompanied by a cover letter that indicates the revisions that have been made. Upon approval of the membership change, NMFS will issue a revised crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit that reflects the change. A new member may not fish on behalf of a cooperative except as a crab IFQ hired master until NMFS issues a revised crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit that reflects the change in membership.

      (4)  If a member of a crab harvesting cooperative dies (in the case of an individual) or dissolves (in the case of a business entity), the QS held by that person will be transferred to the legal successor-in-interest. However, the crab harvesting cooperative IFQs generated by that person's QS holdings remain under the control of the crab harvesting cooperative for the valid duration of the crab harvesting cooperative IFQ permit. Each crab harvesting cooperative is free to establish its own internal procedures for admitting a successor-in-interest during the fishing season to reflect the transfer of QS due to the death or dissolution of a QS holder. The regulations in this section do not require any crab harvesting cooperative to admit a successor-in-interest that the cooperative chooses not to admit. If a crab harvesting cooperative chooses to admit the successor-in-interest for membership, then the crab harvesting cooperative must comply with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

      § 680.22   Sideboard protections for GOA groundfish fisheries.

#### § § 680.22

      The regulations in this section restrict the owners of vessels with a history of participation in the Bering Sea snow crab fishery from using the increased flexibility provided by the CR Program to expand their level of participation in GOA groundfish fisheries. These restrictions are commonly known as “sideboards.”

      (a)  The sideboard fishing restrictions described in this section are based on a vessel's fishing history and apply both to the fishing vessel itself and to any LLP license generated by that vessel's fishing history. The criteria used to determine which vessels and LLP licenses are subject to GOA groundfish sideboard fishing restrictions are as follows:

      (1)  Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets one or both of the following criteria is subject to GOA groundfish sideboard directed fishing closures issued under paragraph (e) of this section except when participating in the Rockfish Program authorized under part 679, subpart G, of this chapter.

      (i) Any non-AFA vessel that made a legal landing of Bering Sea snow crab () between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000, that generated any amount of Bering Sea snow crab () fishery QS; and

      (ii) Any vessel named on an LLP license that was generated in whole or in part by the fishing history of a vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

      (2)  Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets either of the following two criteria is prohibited from directed fishing for Pacific cod in the GOA:

      (i) Any vessel subject to GOA groundfish sideboard closures under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that landed less than 50 mt (110,231 lb), in round weight equivalents, of groundfish harvested from the GOA between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000, or

      (ii) Any vessel named on an LLP license that was generated in whole or in part by the fishing history of a vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (3)  Any vessel or LLP license that NMFS has determined meets either of the following criteria is exempt from sideboard directed fishing closures for Pacific cod in the GOA:

      (i) Any vessel subject to GOA groundfish closures under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that landed less than 750,000 lb (340.2 mt), in raw weight equivalents, of Bering Sea snow crab and more than 680 mt (1,499,143 lb), in round weight equivalents, of Pacific cod harvested from the GOA between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000; and

      (ii) Any LLP license that:

      (A) Was initially issued based on the catch history of a vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section; and

      (B) Did not generate crab QS based on legal landings from any vessel other than the vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.

      (4)  Any vessel or LLP license that NMFS has determined meets either of the following criteria is exempt from sideboard directed fishing closures for pollock in the GOA:

      (i) Any vessel subject to GOA groundfish closures under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that landed less than 1,212,673 lb (550 mt), in raw weight equivalents, of Bering Sea snow crab, and had 20 or more legal landings of pollock harvested from the GOA between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000; and

      (ii) Any LLP license that:

      (A) Was initially issued based on the catch history of a vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section; and

      (B) Did not generate crab QS based on legal landings from any vessel other than the vessel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.

      (b)  After NMFS determines which vessels and LLP licenses meet the criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section, NMFS will inform each vessel owner and LLP license holder in writing of the type of sideboard restriction and issue a revised Federal Fisheries Permit and/or LLP license that displays the restriction on the face of the permit or license.

      (c)  A vessel owner or LLP license holder who believes that NMFS has incorrectly identified his or her vessel or LLP license as meeting the criteria for a GOA groundfish sideboard restriction may request reconsideration. All requests for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the RAM Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, together with any documentation or evidence supporting the request. If the request for reconsideration is denied, affected persons may appeal using the procedures described at § 680.43.

      (d)  Except for fixed gear sablefish, sideboard ratios for each GOA groundfish species, species group, season, operation type, gear type, and area, for which annual specifications are made, are established according to the following formulas:

      (1)  The sideboard ratios for Pacific cod are calculated by dividing the aggregate retained catch of Pacific cod by vessels that are subject to sideboard directed fishing closures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that do not meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section by the total retained catch of Pacific cod by all groundfish vessels between 1996 and 2000.

      (2)  The sideboard ratios for pollock are calculated by dividing the aggregate retained catch of pollock by vessels that are subject to sideboard directed fishing closures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total retained catch of pollock by all groundfish vessels between 1996 and 2000.

      (3)  The sideboard ratios for groundfish species and species groups other than Pacific cod and pollock are calculated by dividing the aggregate landed catch by vessels subject to sideboard directed fishing closures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the total landed catch of that species by all groundfish vessels between 1996 and 2000.

      (e)  NMFS will convert sideboard ratios into annual sideboard harvest limits according to the following procedures.

      (1)  (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, annual sideboard harvest limits for each groundfish species, except fixed-gear sablefish, will be established by multiplying the sideboard ratios calculated under paragraph (d) of this section by the proposed and final TACs in each area for which a TAC is specified. If a TAC is further apportioned by season, the sideboard harvest limit also will be apportioned by season in the same ratio as the overall TAC. The resulting harvest limits expressed in metric tons will be published in the annual GOA groundfish harvest specification notices.

      (ii) NMFS will not establish an annual sideboard harvest limit for Pacific cod for vessels that catch and process Pacific cod using hook-and-line gear in the Central GOA Regulatory Area if all eligible participants request that the sideboard harvest limit be removed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. NMFS will not establish an annual sideboard harvest limit for Pacific cod for vessels that catch and process Pacific cod using hook-and-line gear in the Western GOA Regulatory Area if all eligible participants request that the sideboard harvest limit be removed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. NMFS will publish notification of the removal of the sideboard harvest limit for Pacific cod for vessels that catch and process Pacific cod using hook-and-line gear in the Central GOA Regulatory Area or the Western GOA Regulatory Area through the annual GOA groundfish harvest specifications (see § 679.20(c)(1)(iii) and (c)(3)(ii)).

      (A)  For the Central GOA Regulatory Area (Statistical Areas 620 and 630; see Figure 3 to 50 CFR part 679), the holders of all LLP licenses listed in Column A of Table 10 to this part must submit to NMFS a completed Request to Extinguish Pacific Cod Sideboard Limits for Hook-and-Line Catcher/Processors in the Western or Central GOA, and the request must be received by NMFS on or before May 18, 2016.

      (B)  For the Western GOA Regulatory Area (Statistical Area 610; see Figure 3 to 50 CFR part 679), the holders of all LLP licenses listed in Column B of Table 10 to this part must submit to NMFS a completed Request to Extinguish Pacific Cod Sideboard Limits for Hook-and-Line Catcher/Processors in the Western or Central GOA, and the request must be received by NMFS on or before May 18, 2016.

      (iii) NMFS will not establish an annual sideboard harvest limit for groundfish species, other than Pacific cod apportioned to catcher vessels using pot gear in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas. Directed fishing for groundfish species, other than Pacific cod apportioned to catcher vessels using pot gear in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, is prohibited.

      (2)  (i) If the Regional Administrator determines that a harvest limit for a species or species group has been or will be reached, the Regional Administrator may establish a sideboard directed fishing allowance for the species or species group applicable only to the group of crab vessels to which the sideboard limit applies.

      (ii) If the Regional Administrator determines that a harvest limit is insufficient to support a directed fishery for that species or species group, then the Regional Administrator may set the sideboard directed fishing allowance at zero for that species or species group.

      (3)  Upon attainment of a sideboard directed fishing allowance, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the  prohibiting directed fishing for the species or species group in the specified subarea, regulatory area, or district. A directed fishing closure is effective for the duration of the fishing year or season.

      (f)  Vessels subject to the sideboard restrictions under paragraph (a) of this section, with a Federal Fisheries Permit or LLP license, shall be subject to the regulations of this section while participating in any groundfish fishery in State waters adjacent to the GOA opened by the State of Alaska and for which the State of Alaska adopts a Federal fishing season.

      § 680.23   Equipment and operational requirements.

#### § § 680.23

      (a)  A catcher vessel used to harvest CR crab must:

      (1) Carry and use a VMS as described in paragraph (d) of this section;

      (2) Land all retained crab to an RCR operating under an approved catch monitoring plan as described in paragraph (g) of this section;

      (b)  A catcher/processor used to harvest CR crab must:

      (1) Carry and use a VMS as described in paragraph (d) of this section;

      (2) Weigh all retained crab to be processed on board, in its raw form, on a scale approved by NMFS as described in paragraph (e) of this section;

      (3) Land all retained crab not processed on board at an RCR;

      (4) Offload all CR crab product processed onboard at a shoreside location in the United States accessible by road or regularly scheduled air service; and

      (5) Provide an approved observer platform scale and test weights that meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (c)  An RCR must:

      (1) Ensure that all CR crab landings are weighed on a scale approved by the State in which the landing takes place.

      (2) Ensure that all crab landing and weighing be conducted as specified in an approved crab monitoring plan as described in paragraph (g) of this section, and that a copy of the crab monitoring plan is made available to NMFS personnel or authorized officer upon demand.

      (d) —(1)  General VMS requirements concerning the approval and installation of VMS components and the responsibilities of vessel owners and operators are detailed at § 679.28(f)(1) through (5).

      (2)  A vessel's transmitter must be transmitting if:

      (i) The vessel is operating in any reporting area (see definitions at § 679.2) off Alaska;

      (ii) The vessel has crab pots or crab pot hauling equipment, or a crab pot launcher onboard; and

      (iii) The vessel has or is required to have a Federal crab vessel permit for that crab fishing year.

      (e)  To be approved by NMFS, a scale used to weigh crab at sea must meet the type evaluation and initial inspection requirements set forth in § 679.28(b)(1) and (2). Once a scale is installed on a vessel and approved by NMFS for use, it must be reinspected annually as described in § 679.28(b) by requesting a scale inspection from NMFS. Each scale must be tested daily and meet the maximum permissible error (MPE) requirements described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (1)  To verify that the scale meets the MPEs specified in this paragraph, the vessel operator must test each scale or scale system used to weigh CR crab one time during each 24-hour period when use of the scale is required. The vessel owner must ensure that these tests are performed in an accurate and timely manner.

      (i)  The MPE for the daily at-sea scale tests is plus or minus 3 percent of the known weight of the test material. The scale must be tested by weighing at least 400 kg (882 lb) of crab or an alternative material supplied by the scale manufacturer on the scale under test. The known weight of the test material must be determined by weighing it on a platform scale approved for use under § 679.28 (b)(7).

      (ii)  An automatic hopper scale must be tested at its minimum and maximum capacity with approved test weights. Test weights must be placed in the bottom of the hopper unless an alternative testing method is approved by NMFS. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale tests is plus or minus 2 percent of the weight of the approved test weights.

      (iii)  A platform scale used for observer sampling must be tested at 10, 25, and 50 kg (or 20, 50, and 100 lb if the scale is denominated in pounds) using approved test weights. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus 0.5 percent if the scale is used to determine the known weight of test material for the purpose of testing a belt scale. If the scale is not used for that purpose, the MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus 1 percent.

      (iv)  Each test weight must have its weight stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each test weight must be annually certified by a National Institute of Standards and Technology approved metrology laboratory or approved for continued use by the NMFS authorized inspector at the time of the annual scale inspection.

      (v)  (A) Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before the time that the test will be conducted, and conduct the test while the observer is present.

      (B) Conduct the scale test and record the following information on the at-sea scale test report form:

      () Vessel name;

      () Month, day, and year of test;

      () Time test started to the nearest minute;

      () Known weight of test weights;

      () Weight of test weights recorded by scale;

      () Percent error as determined by subtracting the known weight of the test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, dividing that amount by the known weight of the test weights, and multiplying by 100; and

      () Sea conditions at the time of the scale test.

      (C) Maintain the test report form on board the vessel until the end of the crab fishing year during which the tests were conducted, and make the report forms available to observers, NMFS personnel, or an authorized officer. In addition, the vessel owner must retain the scale test report forms for 3 years after the end of the crab fishing year during which the tests were performed. All scale test report forms must be signed by the vessel operator.

      (2)  The vessel owner must ensure that the vessel operator maintains the scale in proper operating condition throughout its use, that adjustments made to the scale are made so as to bring the performance errors as close as practicable to a zero value, and that no adjustment is made that will cause the scale to weigh inaccurately.

      (3)  The vessel owner must ensure that the printed reports are provided as required by this paragraph. Printed reports from the scale must be maintained on board the vessel until the end of the year during which the reports were made and be made available to NMFS or NMFS authorized personnel. In addition, the vessel owner must retain printed reports for 3 years after the end of the year during which the printouts were made.

      (i)  Reports must be printed at least once every 24 hours prior to submitting a CR crab landing report as described in § 680.5. Reports must also be printed before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced. Scale weights must not be adjusted by the scale operator to account for the perceived weight of water, mud, debris, or other materials. Scale printouts must show:

      (A) The vessel name and Federal crab vessel permit number;

      (B) The weight of each load in the weighing cycle (hopper scales only);

      (C) The date and time the information was printed;

      (D) The total amount weighed since the last printout was made; and

      (E) The total cumulative weight of all crab or other material weighed on the scale.

      (ii)  The printed report must include the information specified in sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and 4.3.1.8 of appendix A to 50 CFR part 679. The printed report must be provided to the authorized scale inspector at each scale inspection and must also be printed at any time upon request of NMFS staff or other NMFS-authorized personnel.

      (iii)  A platform scale used for observer sampling is not required to produce a printed record unless that scale is also used to obtain raw weight for a CR crab landing report.

      (4)  Unless otherwise approved by NMFS, a scale used to obtain raw weight for a CR crab landing report must be installed such that:

      (i) From the location where the observer samples unsorted crab, the observer can ensure that all crab are being weighed;

      (ii) The scale may not be installed in a manner that facilitates bypassing. It must not be possible for the scale inspector and an assistant to bypass the scale with 100 kg (220 lb) of test material in less than 20 seconds.

      (f)  Scale requirements in this paragraph are in addition to those requirements set forth by the State in which the scale is approved, and nothing in this paragraph may be construed to reduce or supersede the authority of the State to regulate, test, or approve scales within the State. Scales used to weigh CR crab that are also required to be approved by the State must meet the following requirements:

      (1)  The scale must display a valid State sticker indicating that the scale was inspected and approved within the previous 12 months.

      (2)  An RCR must ensure that the scale and scale display are visible simultaneously. NMFS personnel or NMFS authorized personnel, including observers, must be allowed to observe the weighing of crab on the scale and be allowed to read the scale display at all times.

      (3)  (i) An RCR must ensure that printouts of the scale weight of each delivery are made available to NMFS personnel or to NMFS authorized personnel, including observers, at the time printouts are generated. An RCR must maintain printouts on site until the end of the fishing year during which the printouts were made and make them available upon request by an authorized officer for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during which the printout was made.

      (ii) A scale used to weigh any portion of a landing of CR crab must produce a printed record for each landing, or portion of each landing, weighed on that scale. The printed record must include:

      (A) The RCR's name;

      (B) The weight of each load in the weighing cycle;

      (C) The total weight of crab in each landing, or portion of the landing that was weighed on that scale;

      (D) The date and time the information is printed; and

      (E) The name and ADF&G vessel registration number of the vessel making the delivery. The scale operator may write this information on the scale printout in ink at the time of landing.

      (4)  Scales used to weigh CR crab must be tested by RCR personnel when testing is requested by NMFS-staff or by NMFS-authorized personnel.

      (i)  To pass an inseason test, NMFS staff or NMFS-authorized personnel will verify that the scale display and printed information are clear and easily read under all conditions of normal operation, that weight values are visible on the display until the value is printed, and that the scale does not exceed the maximum permissible errors specified in the following table:

      (ii)  Scales must be tested with the amount and type of weight specified for each scale type in the following tables under paragraphs (f)(4)(ii)(A) through (f)(4)(ii)(D) of this section:

      (A) Automatic hopper 0 to 150 kg (0 to 300 lb) capacity.

      (B) Automatic hopper >150 kg (300 lb) capacity.

      (C) Platform, flatbed or hanging scales less than 150 kg (300 lb) capacity.

      (D) Platform, flatbed or hanging scales >150 kg (300 lb) capacity.

      (iii)  An RCR must ensure that there are sufficient test weights on-site to test each scale used to weigh CR crab. Each test weight used for inseason scale testing must have its weight stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each test weight must be certified by a National Institute of Standards and Technology approved metrology laboratory every 2 years.

      (iv)  When permitted in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, a scale may be tested with test material other than certified test weights.

      (g)  A CMP is a plan submitted by an RCR for each location or processing vessel where the RCR wishes to take deliveries of CR crab. The CMP must detail how the RCR will meet the catch monitoring standards detailed in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. An RCR that processes only CR crab harvested under a CPO or CPC IFQ permit is not required to prepare a CMP.

      (1)  NMFS will approve a CMP if it meets all the performance standards specified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The location or vessel identified in the CMP may be inspected by NMFS prior to approval of the CMP to ensure that the location conforms to the elements addressed in the CMP. If NMFS disapproves a CMP, the plant owner or manager may resubmit a revised CMP or file an administrative appeal as set forth under the administrative appeals procedures described in § 679.43.

      (2)  The time and place of a CMP inspection may be arranged by submitting a written request for an inspection to NMFS, Alaska Region. An inspection must be requested no less than 10 working days before the requested inspection date. NMFS staff will conduct CMP inspections in any port located in the United States that can be reached by regularly scheduled commercial air service. The inspection request must include:

      (i) Name and signature of the person submitting the application and the date of the application;

      (ii) Address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address (if available) of the person submitting the application; and

      (iii) A proposed CMP detailing how the RCR will meet each of the standards in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.

      (3)  NMFS will approve a CMP for 1 year if it meets the performance standards specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. An owner or manager must notify NMFS in writing if changes are made in plant operations or layout that do not conform to the CMP.

      (4)  An RCR may change an approved CMP by submitting a CMP addendum to NMFS. Depending on the nature and magnitude of the change requested, NMFS may require a CMP inspection as described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A CMP addendum must contain:

      (i) Name and signature of the person submitting the addendum;

      (ii) Address, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address (if available) of the person submitting the addendum; and

      (iii) A complete description of the proposed CMP change.

      (5) —(i)  All crab, including crab parts and crab that are dead or otherwise unmarketable, delivered to the RCR must be sorted and weighed by species. The CMP must detail how and where crab are sorted and weighed.

      (ii)  The CMP must identify by serial number each scale used to weigh crab and describe the rationale for its use.

      (iii)  Scales identified in the CMP must be accurate within the limits specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. For each scale identified in the CMP a testing plan must be developed that:

      (A) Describes the procedure the plant will use to test the scale;

      (B) Lists the test weights and equipment required to test the scale;

      (C) Lists where the test weights and equipment will be stored; and

      (D) Lists the names of the personnel responsible for conducting the scale testing.

      (iv)  An RCR must ensure that the scale produces a complete and accurate printed record of the weight of each species in a landing. All of the crab in a delivery must be weighed on a scale capable of producing a complete printed record as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. A printed record of each landing must be printed before the RCR submits a CR crab landing report.

      (v)  Each CMP must designate an observation area. The observation area is a location designated on the CMP where an individual may monitor the offloading and weighing of crab. The observation area must meet the following standards:

      (A)  The observation area must be freely accessible to observer, NMFS staff or enforcement aides at any time during the effective period of the CMP.

      (B)  From the observation area, an individual must have an unobstructed view or otherwise be able to monitor the entire offload of crab between the first location where crab are removed from the boat and a location where all sorting has taken place and each species has been weighed.

      (C)  The observation area must be sheltered from the weather and not exposed to unreasonable safety hazards.

      (vi)  The CMP must designate a plant liaison. The plant liaison is responsible for:

      (A) Orienting new observers, NMFS staff and enforcement aides to the plant;

      (B) Assisting in the resolution of observer concerns; and

      (C) Informing NMFS if changes must be made to the CMP.

      (vii)  The CMP must be accompanied by a drawing to scale of the delivery location or vessel showing:

      (A) Where and how crab are removed from the delivering vessel;

      (B) The observation area;

      (C) The location of each scale used to weigh crab; and

      (D) Each location where crab is sorted.

      (viii)  All offload and weighing locations detailed in a CMP must be located on the same vessel or in the same geographic location. If a CMP describes facilities for the offloading of vessels at more than one location, it must be possible to see all locations simultaneously.

      § 680.30   [Reserved]

#### § § 680.30

    Subpart C—Quota Management Measures

      § 680.40   Crab Quota Share (QS), Processor QS (PQS), Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ), and Individual Processor Quota (IPQ) Issuance.

#### § § 680.40

      (a)  The Regional Administrator will issue crab QS for the crab QS fisheries defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Regional Administrator will annually issue IFQ based on the amount of QS a person holds. Crab harvested and retained in each crab QS fishery may be harvested and retained only by persons holding the appropriate crab IFQ for that crab QS fishery.

      (1)  With the exception of the WAI golden king crab fishery, the Regional Administrator shall annually apportion 10 percent of the TAC specified by the State of Alaska for each of the fisheries described in Table 1 to this part to the Western Alaska CDQ program. Ten percent of the TAC in the Western Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery will be allocated to the Adak community entity. The remaining TACs for the crab QS fisheries will be apportioned for use by QS holders in each fishery.

      (2)  The official crab rationalization record will be used to determine the amount of QS that is to be allocated for each crab QS fishery. The official crab rationalization record is presumed to be correct. An applicant for QS has the burden to prove otherwise. For the purposes of creating the official crab rationalization record the Regional Administrator will presume the following:

      (i) An LLP license is presumed to have been used onboard the same vessel from which that LLP is derived, unless documentation is provided establishing otherwise.

      (ii) If more than one person is claiming the same legal landings or legal processing activities, then each person eligible to receive QS or PQS based on those activities will receive an equal share of any resulting QS or PQS unless the applicants can provide written documentation establishing an alternative means for distributing the QS or PQS.

      (iii) For the purposes of determining eligibility for CPO QS, a person is presumed to have processed BSAI crab in 1998 or 1999 if the vessel on which the applicant's LLP license is based processed such crab in those years.

      (b) —(1)  The Regional Administrator shall initially assign to qualified persons, crab QS that are specific to the crab QS fisheries defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The crab QS amount issued will be based on legal landings made on vessels authorized to participate in those fisheries in four QS sectors:

      (i)  shall be initially issued to qualified persons defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section based on legal landings of unprocessed crab.

      (ii)  shall be initially issued to qualified persons defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section based on legal landings of unprocessed crab.

      (iii)  shall be initially issued to qualified persons defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section based on legal landings of crab that were harvested and processed on the same vessel.

      (iv)  shall be initially issued to qualified persons defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section based on legal landings of crab that were harvested and processed on the same vessel.

      (2)  (i) Regional designations apply to:

      (A)  if the legal landings that gave rise to the QS for a crab QS fishery were landed in the Bering Sea subarea north of 56°20′ N. lat.; or

      (B)  if the legal landings that gave rise to the QS for a crab QS fishery were not landed in the North Region, and all CVO QS allocated to the WAI crab QS fishery; or

      (C)  for a portion of the QS allocated to the WAG crab QS fishery subject to the provisions under § 680.40(c)(4).

      (ii) Regional designations do not apply (Undesignated QS) to:

      (A) Crab QS for the EBT or WBT crab QS fishery;

      (B) Crab QS for that portion of the WAG QS fishery not regionally designated for the West region;

      (C) CVC QS;

      (D) CPO QS unless that QS is transferred to the CVO QS sector, in which case the regional designation is made by the recipient of the resulting CVO QS at the time of transfer; and

      (E) CPC QS.

      (iii) The regional designations that apply to each of the crab QS fisheries are specified in the following table:

      (iv) The regional designation ratios applied to QS and PQS for each crab QS fishery will be established based on the regional designations determined on August 1, 2005. QS or PQS issued after this date will be issued in the same ratio.

      (3)  means, for the purposes of QS issuance, a person, as defined in § 679.2, who at the time of application for QS meets the following criteria for each of the QS sectors:

      (i)  Holds one or more permanent, fully transferable crab LLP licenses and is a citizen of the United States;

      (ii)  (A) Holds one or more permanent, fully transferable crab LLP licenses with a Catcher/Processor designation and is a citizen of the United States; and

      (B) Harvested and processed at sea any crab species in any BSAI crab fishery during the years 1998 or 1999.

      (iii)  (A) Is an individual who is a citizen of the United States, or his or her successor-in-interest if that individual is deceased;

      (B) Has historical participation in the fishery demonstrated by being the individual named on a State of Alaska Interim Use Permit for a QS crab fishery and made at least one legal landing per year for any 3 eligibility years under that permit based on data from fish tickets maintained by the State of Alaska. The qualifying years are described in Column C of Table 7 to this part.

      (C) Has recent participation in the fishery demonstrated by being the individual named on a State of Alaska Interim Use Permit for a QS crab fishery and made at least one legal landing under that permit in any 2 of 3 seasons based on data from fish tickets maintained by the State of Alaska. Those seasons are defined in Column D of Table 7 to this part; except that the requirement for recent participation does not apply if:

      () The legal landings that qualify the individual for QS in the PIK crab QS fishery were made from a vessel that was less than 60 feet length overall; or

      () If the individual who is otherwise eligible to receive an initial issuance of QS died while working as part of a harvesting crew in any U.S. commercial fishery.

      (4) —(i)  The qualifying years for each crab QS fishery are described in Column B of Table 7 to this part.

      (ii)  means, for the purpose of initial allocation of QS, crab harvested during the qualifying years specified in Column B of Table 7 to this part and landed in compliance with state and Federal permitting, landing, and reporting regulations in effect at the time of the landing.

      (A) Legal landings exclude any deadloss, test fishing, fishing conducted under an experimental, exploratory, or scientific activity permit, or the fishery conducted under the Western Alaska CDQ Program.

      (B) Landings made onboard a vessel that gave rise to a crab LLP license or made under the authority of an LLP license are non-severable from the crab LLP license until QS has been issued for those legal landings, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.

      (C) Landings may only be used once for each QS sector for the purposes of allocating QS.

      (D) Landings made from vessels which are used for purposes of receiving compensation through the BSAI Crab Capacity Reduction Program may not be used for the allocation of CVO QS or CPO QS.

      (E) Legal landings for purposes of allocating QS for a crab QS fishery only include those landings that resulted in the issuance of an LLP license endorsed for that crab QS fishery, or landings that were made in that crab QS fishery under the authority of an LLP license endorsed for that crab QS fishery, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.

      (iii)  Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to State of Alaska fish tickets.

      (c) —(1)  (i) For each permanent, fully transferable crab LLP license under which an applicant applies, CVO and CPO QS will be based on legal landings that resulted in the issuance of that license or from legal landings that were made under the authority of that license.

      (ii) For each State of Alaska Interim Use Permit under which an applicant applies for CVC QS or CPC QS, the initial allocation of QS will be based on the legal landings that were made under the authority of that permit.

      (2)  (i) Based on the official crab rationalization record the Regional Administrator shall derive the annual harvest denominator (AHD) that represents the amount of legally landed crab in each crab QS fishery in each qualifying year as established in Column B of Table 7 to this part.

      (ii) The initial QS pool is described in Table 8 to this part.

      (iii) A person's initial allocation of QS shall be based on a percentage of the legal landings for the applicable sector in each crab QS fishery:

      (A) Associated with crab LLP licenses held by the applicant for CVO or CPO QS; or

      (B) Authorized under a State of Alaska Interim Use Permit held by the applicant for CVC or CPC QS.

      (iv) The Regional Administrator shall calculate the allocation of CVO and CPO QS for each crab QS fishery “f” based on each fully transferable LLP license “l” held by a qualified person by the following formulas:

      (A) Sum legal landings for each qualifying year, as described in Column B of Table 7 to this part, and divide that amount by the AHD for that year as follows:

      (B) In those fisheries where only a subset of the qualifying years are applied, the Regional Administrator will use the years that yield the highest percentages of each AHD as calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.

      (C) Sum the highest percentages of the AHD's for that license as calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section and divide by the number in Column E of Table 7 to this part (Subset of Qualifying Years). This yields the Average Percentage as presented in the following equation:

      (D) Divide the Average percentage in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section for a license and fishery by the Sum of all Average Percentages for all licenses for that fishery as presented in the following equation:

      (E) Multiply the Percentage of the Total Percentages in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(D) of this section by the Initial QS Pool as described in Table 8 to this part. This yields the unadjusted number of QS units derived from a license for a fishery.

      (F) Multiply the unadjusted number of QS units in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of this section by 97 percent. This yields the number of QS units to be allocated.

      (G) Determine the percentage of legal landings in the subset of qualifying years associated with a LLP license with a catcher/processor designation that were processed on that vessel and multiply the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) of this section by this percentage. This yields the amount of CPO QS to be allocated.

      (H) Determine the percentage of legal landings in the subset of qualifying years associated with a LLP license that were not processed on that vessel and multiply the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) of this section by this percentage. This yields the amount of CVO QS to be allocated.

      (I) Determine the percentage of legal landings associated with an LLP license in the subset of qualifying years that were delivered in each region as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(H) of this section is multiplied by the percentage for each region.

      (J) The percentage calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(I) of this section may be adjusted according to the provisions at paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.

      (v) As shown in the formulas under this paragraph (c)(2)(v), the allocation of CVC and CPC QS for each crab QS fishery “f” based on each State of Alaska Interim Use Permit “i” held by each qualified person shall be calculated by the Regional Administrator as follows:

      (A) Sum legal landings for each qualifying year as described in Column B of Table 7 to this part and divide that amount by the AHD for that year using the following equation:

      (B) In those fisheries where only a subset of the qualifying years are applied, the Regional Administrator will use the years that yield the highest percentages of the AHD as calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section.

      (C) Sum the highest percentages of the AHDs for that license calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section and divide by the number in Column E of Table 7 to this part (Subset of Qualifying Years). This yields the Average Percentage as presented in the following equation:

      (D) Divide the Average Percentage in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section for a permit and fishery by the Sum of all Average Percentages for all permits for that fishery as presented in the following equation:

      (E) Multiply the Percentage of the Total Percentages in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(E) of this section by the Initial QS Pool as described in Table 8 to this part. This yields the unadjusted number of QS units derived from a permit for a fishery.

      (F) Multiply the unadjusted number of QS units in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(E) of this section by 3 percent. This yields the number of QS units to be allocated.

      (G) Determine the percentage of legal landings in the subset of qualifying years associated with a permit that were processed on that vessel and multiply the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(F) of this section by this percentage. This yields the amount of CPC QS to be allocated.

      (H) Determine the percentage of legal landings in the subset of qualifying years associated with a permit that were not processed on that vessel and multiply the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(F) of this section by this percentage. This yields the amount of CVC QS to be allocated.

      (I) Determine the percentage of legal landings associated with a permit in the subset of qualifying years that were delivered in each region as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(H) of this section is multiplied by the percentage for each region.

      (J) The percentage calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(I) of this section may be adjusted according to the provisions at paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. The amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(H) of this section is multiplied by the percentage for each region. These regional QS designations do not apply to CVC QS.

      (vi)  (A) If a person applies for CVO QS or CPO QS based, in whole or in part, on the activities of a vessel that sank, the Regional Administrator shall presume landings for that vessel for the crab fishing years between the time of vessel loss and the replacement of the vessel under § 679.4(k)(5)(v) of this chapter. These presumed landings shall be equivalent to 50 percent of the average legal landings for the qualifying years established in Column B of Table 7 to this part unaffected by the sinking. If the vessel sank during a qualifying year, the legal landings for that year will not be used as the basis for presumed landings;

      (B) If a person applies for CVO QS or CPO QS based, in whole or in part, on the activities of a vessel that sank and:

      () The person who owned the vessel that sank would have been denied eligibility to replace a sunken vessel under the provisions of Public Law _1_06-554; and

      () The vessel that sank was replaced with a newly constructed vessel, with that vessel under construction no later than June 10, _2_002. For purposes of this section a vessel is considered under construction once the keel for that vessel has been laid; and

      () The newly constructed vessel participated in any Bering Sea crab fishery no later than October _3_1, 2002;

      () Then the Regional Administrator shall presume landings for that vessel for the crab fishing years between the time of vessel loss and the replacement of the vessel. These presumed landings shall be equivalent to 50 percent of the average legal landings for the qualifying years established in Column B of Table 7 to this part unaffected by the sinking. If the vessel sank during a qualifying year, the legal landings for that year will not be used as the basis for presumed landings.

      (vii)  An applicant for CVO or CPO QS who:

      (A) Deployed a vessel in a crab QS fishery under the authority of an interim or permanent fully transferable LLP license; and

      (B) Prior to January 1, 2002, received by transfer, as authorized by NMFS, a permanent fully transferable LLP license for use in that crab QS fishery to insure that a vessel would remain authorized to participate in the fishery, may choose to use as the legal landings which are the basis for QS allocation on his or her application for crab QS or PQS either:

      () The legal landings made on that vessel for that crab QS fishery prior to the transfer of the permanent fully transferable LLP license for use on that vessel; or

      () The legal landings made on the vessel that gave rise to the permanent fully transferable LLP license and the legal landings made under the authority of that same LLP license in that crab QS fishery prior to January 1, _2_002.

      (C) If the history described in paragraph (c)(_2_)(vii)(B)() of this section is being used by another person for an allocation with an LLP license, then the allocation in paragraph (c)(2)(vii) will be based on the legal landings as described under paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(B)() of this section.

      (3)  The Regional Administrator may adjust the regional designation of QS to ensure that it is initially allocated in the same proportion as the regional designation of PQS for that crab QS fishery. A person who would receive QS based on the legal landings in only one region, will receive QS with only that regional designation. A person who would receive QS with more than one regional designation for that crab QS fishery would have his or her QS holdings regionally adjusted on a pro rata basis as follows:

      (i) Determine the ratio of the Initial PQS pool in the North and South regions.

      (ii) Multiply the Initial QS pool by the ratio of North and South PQS. This will yield the target QS pool for each region.

      (iii) Sum the QS for all persons who are eligible to receive North QS yielding the unadjusted North QS pool, and sum the QS for all persons who are eligible to receive South QS yielding the unadjusted South QS pool.

      (iv) To calculate the amount of QS available for adjustment, subtract the amount of QS for persons receiving North only QS from the unadjusted North QS pool and subtract the amount of QS for persons receiving South only QS from the unadjusted South QS pool, as presented in the following equations:

      (A) Unadj. North QS −North QS only = North QS for [North & South] QS holders.

      (B) Unadj. South QS −South QS only = South QS for [North & South] QS holders.

      (v) Determine which region becomes the gaining region if the target QS pool is greater than the unadjusted QS pool.

      (vi) Subtract the gaining region unadjusted QS pool from the gaining region target QS pool to calculate the number of QS units that need to be applied to the gaining region. This amount is the Adjustment Amount as presented in the following equation:

      (vii) Divide the Adjustment Amount by the unadjusted losing region QS pool for North and South QS holders. This yields the regional adjustment factor (RAF) for each person as presented in the following equation:

      (viii) For each person (p) who holds both North and South Region QS, the QS adjustment (QS Adj. (p)) to that person's Unadjusted losing region QS is expressed in the following equation as:

      (ix) The QS adjustment for person (p) is made by subtracting the QS adjustment from that person's unadjusted losing region QS amount and added to that person's unadjusted gaining region QS. These adjustments will yield the regional adjustment QS amounts for that person.

      (4)  Fifty percent of the CVO QS that is issued in the WAG crab QS fishery will be initially issued with a West regional designation. The West regional designation applies to QS for delivery west of 174° W. longitude. The remaining 50 percent of the CVO QS initially issued for this fishery is not subject to regional designation (Undesignated QS). A person (p) who would receive QS based on the legal landings in only one region will receive QS with only that regional designation. A person who would receive QS with more than one regional designation for that crab QS fishery would have his or her QS holdings regionally adjusted on a pro rata basis as follows:

      (i) The West QS pool is equal to 50 percent of the initial QS pool.

      (ii) The Undesignated QS pool is equal to 50 percent of the initial QS pool.

      (iii) Sum the QS for all persons who are eligible to receive West QS yielding the unadjusted West QS pool, and sum the QS for all persons who are eligible to receive undesignated QS yielding the unadjusted undesignated QS pool.

      (iv) To calculate the amount of QS available for adjustment, subtract the amount of QS for persons receiving West only QS from the unadjusted West QS pool and subtract the amount of QS for persons receiving undesignated only QS from the unadjusted undesignated QS pool, as presented in the following equation:

      (A) Unadj. West QS−West QS only = West QS for [West & Undesignated] QS holders.

      (B) Unadj. Undesignated QS−Undesignated QS only = Undesignated QS for [West & Undesignated] QS holders.

      (v) Subtract the gaining region Unadjusted QS pool from the gaining region Target QS pool to calculate the number of QS units that will need to be applied to the gaining region. This amount is the Adjustment Amount as presented in the following equation:

      (vi) Divide the Adjustment Amount by the unadjusted losing region QS pool for West and Undesignated QS holders. This yields the regional adjustment factor (RAF) for each person as presented in the following equation:

      (vii) For each person (p) who holds both unadjusted West and Undesignated Region QS, the QS adjustment (QS Adj. p) to that person's Unadjusted West QS is expressed in the following equation as:

      (viii) The QS adjustment for person (p) is made by subtracting the QS adjustment for that person's unadjusted losing region QS amount and subtracted from that person's unadjusted gaining region QS. These adjustments will yield the regional adjustment QS amounts for that person.

      (5)  (i) For each crab fishing year, the Regional Administrator may issue converted CPO QS for the BBR or BSS crab QS fishery with a North Region designation to an entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(iii), or (c)(5)(iv) of this section if NMFS has approved an application for converted CPO QS/IFQ for that crab fishing year.

      (ii) Entity A is comprised only of Yardarm Knot, Inc. (NMFS ID # 675).

      (iii) Entity B is comprised only of Blue Dutch, LLC (NMFS ID # 3163).

      (iv) Entity C is comprised only of Trident Seafoods, Inc. (NMFS ID # 8184).

      (v) NMFS will issue Entity A, B, or C, described in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) through (c)(5)(iv) of this section, one unit of converted CPO for each unit of CVO QS and 0.9 units of PQS indicated in an approved application for converted CPO QS/IFQ.

      (vi) For each crab fishing year, the Regional Administrator will not issue CPO QS for the BBR or BSS crab QS fishery:

      (A) To Entity A described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section that is greater than the amount of converted CPO QS that may be derived from the amount of PQS units with a North Region designation initially issued by NMFS to Yardarm Knot, Inc. (NMFS ID # 675), and any affiliates of Yardarm Knot, Inc., as listed on an annual application for converted CPO QS/IFQ for that crab fishing year;

      (B) To Entity B described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section that is greater than the amount of converted CPO QS that may be derived from the amount of PQS units with a North Region designation initially issued by NMFS to Blue Dutch, LLC, (NMFS ID # 3163) under paragraph (e)(3) of this section and any affiliates of Blue Dutch, LLC, as listed on an annual application for annual application for converted CPO QS/IFQ for that crab fishing year; and

      (C) To Entity C described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section that is greater than the amount of converted CPO QS that may be derived from the amount of CVO QS units with a North Region designation initially issued by NMFS to Trident Seafoods, Inc. (NMFS ID # 8184), and any affiliates of Trident Seafoods, Inc., as listed on an annual application for converted CPO QS/IFQ for that crab fishing year;

      (vii) CPO IFQ derived from converted CPO QS may be issued to a crab harvesting cooperative only if the entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(iii), or (c)(5)(iv) of this section holding the converted CPO QS is a member of that crab harvesting cooperative.

      (6)  Any crab harvested under a CPO IFQ permit derived from converted CPO QS must be offloaded in the Bering Sea subarea north of 56°20′ N. lat.

      (d) —(1)  The Regional Administrator shall initially assign to qualified persons defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section crab PQS specific to crab QS fisheries defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The crab PQS amount issued will be based on total legal processing of crab made in those crab QS fisheries. PQS shall yield annual IPQ as defined under paragraph (j) of this section.

      (2)  For each crab QS fishery, PQS shall be initially regionally designated based on the legal processing that gave rise to the PQS as follows:

      (i)  if the processing that gave rise to the PQS for a crab QS fishery occurred in the Bering Sea subarea north of 56°20′ N. lat.; or

      (ii)  if the processing that gave rise the PQS for a crab QS fishery did not occur in the North Region, and PQS allocated to the WAI crab QS fishery; or

      (iii)  for a portion of the PQS allocated to the WAG crab QS fishery subject to the provisions under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or

      (iv)  Regional designations do not apply to:

      (A) That portion of the WAG crab QS fishery that is not regionally designated as West Region PQS; and

      (B) The EBT or WBT crab QS fishery.

      (v) The specific regional designations that apply to PQS in each of the crab QS fisheries are described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (3)  for the purposes of PQS issuance, means a person, as defined at § 679.2, who at the time of application for PQS is a U.S. citizen, or a U.S. corporation, partnership, association, or other entity, and who:

      (i) Legally processed any crab QS species established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section during 1998 or 1999 as demonstrated on the official crab rationalization record; or

      (ii) Did not legally process any crab QS species during 1998 or 1999 according to the official crab rationalization record, but who:

      (A) Processed BSS crab QS species in each crab season for that fishery during the period from 1988 through 1997; and

      (B) From January 1, 1996, through June 10, 2002, invested in a processing facility, processing equipment, or a vessel for use in processing operations, including any improvements made to existing facilities with a total expenditure in excess of $1,000,000; or

      (C) Is the person to whom the history of legal processing of crab has been transferred by the express terms of a written contract that clearly and unambiguously provides that such legal processing of crab has been transferred. This provision would apply only if that applicant for PQS:

      () Legally processed any crab QS species established in paragraph (a)(_1_) of this section during 1998 or 1999, as demonstrated on the official crab rationalization record; or

      () Received history of crab processing that was legally processed during 1998 or 1999, as demonstrated on the official crab rationalization record.

      (iii) Qualified persons, or their successors-in-interest, must exist at the time of application for PQS.

      (iv) A former partner of a dissolved partnership or a former shareholder of a dissolved corporation who would otherwise be a qualified person may apply for PQS in proportion to his or her ownership interest in the dissolved partnership or corporation.

      (v) A person who has acquired a processing corporation, partnership, or other entity that has a history of legal processing of crab is presumed to have received by transfer all of that history of legal processing of crab unless a clear and unambiguous written contract establishes otherwise.

      (4) —(i)  The qualifying years for each crab QS fishery are designated in Table 9 to this part.

      (ii)  Documentation of ownership interest in a dissolved partnership or corporation, association, or other entity shall be limited to corporate documents (e.g., articles of incorporation) or notarized statements signed by each former partner, shareholder or director, and specifying their proportions of interest.

      (iii)  means, for the purpose of initial allocation of PQS, raw crab pounds processed in the crab QS fisheries designated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in compliance with state and Federal permitting, landing, and reporting regulations in effect at the time of the landing. Legal processing excludes any deadloss, processing of crab harvested in a test fishery or under a scientific, education, exploratory, or experimental permit, or under the Western Alaska CDQ Program.

      (iv)  Evidence of legal processing shall be limited to State of Alaska fish tickets, except that:

      (A) NMFS may use information from a State of Alaska Commercial Operators Annual Report, State of Alaska fishery tax records, or evidence of direct payment from a receiver of crab to a harvester if that information indicates that the buyer of crab differs from the receiver indicated on State of Alaska fish ticket records; however:

      (B) Information on State of Alaska fish tickets shall be presumed to be correct for the purpose of determining evidence of legal processing of crab. An applicant will have the burden of proving the validity of information submitted in an application that is inconsistent with the information on the State of Alaska fish ticket.

      (e) —(1)  (i) The Regional Administrator shall establish the Total Processing Denominator (TPD) which represents the amount of legally processed raw crab pounds in each crab QS fishery in all qualifying years.

      (ii) For each crab QS fishery, the percentage of the initial PQS pool that will be distributed to each qualified person shall be based on their percentage of the TPD according to the following procedure:

      (A) Sum the raw crab pounds purchased for each person for all qualifying years.

      (B) Divide the sum calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section by the TPD. Multiply by 100. This yields a person's percentage of the TPD.

      (C) Sum the TPD percentages of all persons.

      (D) Divide the percentage for a person calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the sum calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section for all persons. This yields a person's percentage of the TPD.

      (E) Multiply the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(D) of this section by the PQS pool for that crab QS fishery as that amount is defined in Table 8 to this part.

      (F) Determine the percentages of legally processed crab that were processed in each region. The percentages calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(E) of this section are multiplied by the amount determined within each regional designation. Regional designations will apply to that PQS according to the provisions established in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(2) of this section.

      (2)  (i) Fifty percent of the PQS that is issued in the WAG crab QS fishery will be issued with a West regional designation. The West regional designation applies to PQS for processing west of 174° N. long. The remaining 50 percent of the PQS issued for this fishery is Undesignated region PQS.

      (ii) A person will receive only West PQS if, at the time of application, that person owns a crab processing facility that is located in the West region. A person will receive West region and Undesignated Region PQS if, at the time of application, that person does not own a crab processing facility located in the West region. Expressed algebraically, for any person (p) allocated both West region PQS and undesignated region PQS the formula is as follows:

      (A) PQS = PQS × 0.50

      (B) PQS = PQS × 0.50

      (C) PQS for PQS holders = PQS−PQS

      (D) PQS for Person = PQS × PQS for PQS holders/(PQS for PQS holders + PQS)

      (E) PQS for Person = PQS−PQS for Person

      (iii) For purposes of the allocation of PQS in the WAG crab fishery:

      (A) Ownership of a processing facility is defined as:

      () A sole proprietor; or

      () A relationship between two or more entities in which a person directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in another, or a third entity directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in both.

      (B) A processing facility is a shoreside crab processor or a stationary floating crab processor.

      (3)  (i) Pursuant to Public Law 109-241, NMFS issued 3,015,229 units of PQS for the BBR crab QS fishery and 7,516,253 units of PQS for the BSS crab QS fishery.

      (ii) PQS units issued to Blue Dutch, LLC, under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section were assigned a regional designation according to the procedures established in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.

      (iii) PQS units issued to Blue Dutch, LLC, under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section may not be transferred to any other person.

      (f) —(1)  The Regional Administrator will issue QS and/or PQS to an applicant if a complete application for crab QS or PQS is submitted by or on behalf of the applicant during the specified application period, and if the applicant meets all criteria for eligibility as specified at paragraphs (b)(3) and (d)(3) of this section.

      (vii)  The applicant must sign and date the application certifying that all information is true, correct, and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief. If the application is completed by an authorized representative, then authorization must accompany the application.

      (3)  (i) To be complete, an application for PQS from a person based on legal processing that occurred in an ECC, other than Adak, must also include an affidavit signed by the applicant stating that notice has been provided to the ECC of the applicant's intent to apply for PQS. If the ECC designates an entity to represent it in the exercise of ROFR under § 680.41(l), then the application also must include an affidavit of completion of a contract for ROFR that includes the terms enacted under section 313(j) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The affidavit must be signed by the applicant for initial allocation of PQS and the ECC entity designated under § 680.41(l)(2). A list of contract terms is available from the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  A copy of these contract terms also will be made available by mail or facsimile by contacting the Regional Administrator at 907-586-7221.

      (ii) To be complete, an application for crab QS or PQS from a person based on legal processing that occurred in the GOA north of a line at 56°20′ N. lat. must also include an affidavit signed by the applicant stating that notice has been provided to the City of Kodiak and Kodiak Island Borough of the applicant's intent to apply for PQS. If the City of Kodiak and Kodiak Island Borough designate an entity to represent it in the exercise of ROFR under § 680.41(l), then the application also must include an affidavit of completion of a contract for ROFR that includes the terms enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 (Pub.

A list of contract terms is available from the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  A copy of these contract terms also will be made available by mail or facsimile by contacting the Regional Administrator at (907) 586-7221.

      (4)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate Applications for Crab QS or PQS submitted during the specified application period and compare all claims in an application with the information in the official crab rationalization record. Claims in an application that are consistent with information in the official crab rationalization record will be accepted by the Regional Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the Applications for Crab QS or PQS, unless verified by documentation, will not be accepted. An applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, will be provided a single 30-day evidentiary period as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official crab rationalization record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official crab rationalization record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct.

      (5)  The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted prior to or within the 30-day evidentiary period. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the official crab rationalization record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for QS or PQS. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the applicant will be notified by an IAD, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official crab rationalization record.

      (6)  The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a single 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official crab rationalization record, if the Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the burden of proving that the information on the application is correct through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section will have 30 days to provide that information. An applicant will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period per application. Additional information or evidence, or a revised application, received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the IAD.

      (7)  If an ECC designates an entity to represent it in the exercise of ROFR under § 680.41(l), then the Regional Administrator will not prepare an IAD on unverified claims or issue PQS until an affidavit is received from the applicant confirming the completion of a civil contract for ROFR as required under section 313(j) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

      (8)  The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official crab rationalization record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive crab QS or PQS until after the final resolution of that appeal in the applicant's favor.

      (g) —(1)  IFQ is assigned based on the underlying QS. Except for CVC and CPC QS permit holders who fail to meet the participation requirements at paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall assign crab IFQs to each person who holds QS and submits a complete annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ permit as described under § 680.4. IFQ will be assigned to a crab QS fishery with the appropriate regional designation, QS sector, and IFQ class. This amount will represent the maximum amount of crab that may be harvested from the specified crab QS fishery by the person to whom it is assigned during the specified crab fishing year, unless the IFQ assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator because of an approved transfer, revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904.

      (2)  For each crab fishing year after June 30, 2027, individuals holding CVC QS or CPC QS permits must meet the participation requirements set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section in order to receive CVC IFQ or CPC IFQ, unless the CVC QS permit holder or CPC QS permit holder meets the exemption provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (i) During one of the 3 crab fishing years preceding the crab fishing year for which the individual is filing an annual crab IFQ permit application, the individual has participated as crew in at least:

      (A) One fishing trip where a delivery of crab is made in any CR fishery; or

      (B) 30 days of:

      () Fishing in a commercial fishery managed by the State of Alaska or in a Federal commercial fishery in the EEZ off Alaska. Individuals may combine their participation as crew in State of Alaska and Federal commercial fisheries in waters off Alaska to meet this requirement; or

      () On a tender vessel operating in support of a commercial fishery managed by the State of Alaska or in a Federal commercial fishery in the EEZ off Alaska. Individuals may combine their participation as crew on a tender vessel in State of Alaska and Federal commercial fisheries in waters off Alaska to meet this requirement.

      (C) Individuals may combine their participation specified in paragraphs (g)(_2_)(i)(B)() and () of this section to meet this requirement.

      (D) If the individual holds CVC QS or CPC QS in one or more CR fisheries and all CR crab fisheries for which the QS holder holds QS are closed, NMFS will exclude that crab fishing year when determining whether the individual has satisfied the participation requirements specified in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.

      (ii) All of the CVC QS or CPC QS permits held by the individual were acquired using the eligibility criteria in § 680.41(c)(1)(vii)(B) or reissued under paragraph (m)(6) of this section and the individual has held those CVC QS or CPC QS permits for less than 3 crab fishing years.

      (3)  Beginning July 1, 2027, the Regional Administrator will withhold issuance of CVC IFQ or CPC IFQ to an individual who has not met the participation requirements set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The Regional Administrator will withhold an individual's CVC IFQ or CPC IFQ in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i)  The Regional Administrator will issue a Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding to an individual holding CVC or CPC QS if, after reviewing the CVC or CPC QS holder's Application for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, the Regional Administrator determines that the CVC or CPC QS holder has failed to meet the participation requirements in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A CVC or CPC QS holder who receives a Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding will have 30 days to provide the Regional Administrator with information demonstrating participation as crew that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the CVC or CPC QS holder following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the CVC or CPC QS holder fails to demonstrate participation as crew and is insufficient to rebut the information included in the CVC or CPC QS holder's Applications for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, or if the additional information or evidence is not provided within the time period specified in the Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding. The IAD will explain the basis for the withholding of IFQ. A CVC or CPC QS holder who receives an IAD withholding IFQ may appeal under the appeals procedures set forth at 15 CFR part 906. A CVC or CPC QS holder who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD withholding IFQ will not receive crab IFQ until after the final resolution of that appeal in the QS holder's favor.

      (h) —(1)  (i) The annual allocation of IFQ to any person (p) in any crab QS fishery (f) will be based on the TAC of crab for that crab QS fishery less the allocation to the Western Alaska CDQ Program (“CDQ Reserve”) and Western Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery. Expressed algebraically, the annual IFQ allocation formula is as follows:

      (A) IFQ TAC = TAC − (CDQ Reserve + Allocation ***f***or the Western Aleutian Island golden king crab fishery)

      (B) IFQ = IFQ TAC × (QS/QS pool)

      (ii)  Each year, 3 percent o**f** the IFQ TAC will be allocated as CVC IFQ or CPC IFQ and 97 percent of the IFQ TAC will be allocated as CVO IFQ or CPO IFQ. Expressed algebraically, the formulas for the annual IFQ allocations are as follows:

      (A) CVC/CPC IFQ = IFQ TAC × 0.03

      (B) CVO/CPO IFQ = IFQ TAC × 0.97

      (2)  (i) QS shall yield Class A or Class B IFQ if:

      (A) Initially assigned to the CVO QS sector; or

      (B) Transferred to the CVO QS sector from the CPO QS sector.

      (ii) The Class A/B IFQ TAC is the portion of the TAC assigned as Class A/B IFQ under paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

      (3)  (i) Class A and Class B IFQ shall be assigned on an annual basis such that the total amount of Class A and B IFQ assigned in a crab fishing year in each crab QS fishery for each region will be in a ratio of 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class B IFQ.

      (ii) The Regional Administrator will determine the amount of Class A and Class B IFQ that is assigned to each QS holder. The Class A IFQ is calculated by allocating 90 percent of the Class A/B IFQ TAC (TAC a) to Class A IFQ. A portion of the IFQ TAC a is allocated to persons eligible to hold only Class A IFQ (TAC a only), the remaining IFQ TAC (TAC r) is allocated for harvest by a person (p) eligible to receive both Class A IFQ and Class B IFQ. Expressed algebraically, for an individual person (p) eligible to hold both Class A and Class B IFQ the annual allocation formula is as follows:

      (A) TAC = Cl*a*ss A/B IFQ TAC × 0.90

      (B) TAC = TAC−TAC

      (C) IFQ = TAC/(Class A/B IFQ TAC−TAC) × IFQ

      (D) IFQ = IFQ−IFQ

      (4)  If a person holds IPQ and IFQ, than that person will be issued Class A IFQ only for the amount of IFQ equal to the amount of IPQ held by that person. Any remaining IFQ held by that person will be issued as Class A and Class B IFQ in a ratio so that the total Class A and Class B IFQ issued in that crab QS fishery is issued as 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class B IFQ;

      (5)  If an IPQ holder holds IPQ in excess of the amount of IFQ held by that person, all IFQ holders affiliated with that IPQ holder will receive only Class A IFQ in proportion to the amount of IFQ held by those affiliated persons relative to that amount of IPQ held by that IPQ holder. Any remaining IFQ held by persons affiliated with the IPQ holder will be issued as Class A and Class B IFQ in a ratio so that the total Class A and Class B IFQ issued in that fishery is issued as 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class B IFQ.

      (6)  (i) QS that is initially allocated to the CVC QS sector shall yield _CVC IFQ._

      (ii) CVC IFQ is not subject to regional designation.

      (7)  (i) QS that is initially allocated to the CPO QS sector shall yield _CPO IFQ._

      (ii) CPO IFQ is not subject to regional designation.

      (8)  (i) QS that is initially allocated to the CPC QS sector shall yield _CPC IFQ._

      (ii) CPC IFQ is not subject to regional designation.

      (9)  For purposes of calculating IFQ for any crab fishing year, the amount of a person's QS and the amount of the QS pool for any crab QS fishery will be the amounts on record with the Alaska Region, NMFS, at the time of calculation.

      (10)  (i) The amount of Class A IFQ issued in excess of the IPQ issuance limits for the BSS or BBR crab QS fisheries, as described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, will be issued to all Class A IFQ recipients on a pro rata basis in proportion to the amount of Class A IFQ held by each person.

      (ii) Any amount of Class A IFQ that is issued in excess of the IPQ issuance limits for the BSS or BBR crab QS fisheries, as described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, is not required to be delivered to an RCR with unused IPQ.

      (i)  IPQ is assigned based on the underlying PQS. The Regional Administrator shall assign crab IPQs to each person who submits a complete annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ permit as described under § 680.4. Each assigned IPQ will be specific to a crab QS fishery with the appropriate regional designation. This amount will represent the maximum amount of crab that may be received from the specified crab QS fishery by the person to whom it is assigned during the specified crab fishing year, unless the IPQ assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator because of an approved transfer, revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904.

      (j) —(1)  The *a*nnual allocation of TAC to PQS and the resulting IPQ in any crab QS fishery (f) is the Class A IFQ TAC (TAC). A person's annual IPQ is based on the amount of PQS held by a person (PQS p) divided by the PQS pool for that crab QS fishery for all PQS holders (PQS pool f). Expressed algebraically, the annual IPQ allocation formula is as follows:

      (2)  For purposes of calculating IPQs for any crab fishing year, the amount of a person's PQS and the amount of the PQS pool for any crab PQS fishery will be the amounts on record with the Alaska Region, NMFS, at the time of calculation.

      (3)  The amount of IPQ issued in any crab fishing year shall not exceed:

      (i) 157,500,000 raw crab pounds (71,441.5 mt) in the BSS crab QS fishery; and

      (ii) 18,000,000 raw crab pounds (8,164.7 mt) in the BBR crab QS fishery.

      (4) —(i)  For each crab fishing year that the total allowable catch for BBR CR crab is greater than 15,732,480 lb (7,136.2 mt), NMFS will issue IPQ for the 3,015,229 units of PQS issued to Blue Dutch, LLC, pursuant to Public Law 109-241.

      (ii)  For each crab fishing year that the total allowable catch for BSS CR crab is greater than 21,350,640 lb (9,684.6 mt), NMFS will issue IPQ for the 7,516,253 units of PQS issued to Blue Dutch, LLC, pursuant to Public Law 109-241.

      (k)  IFQ and IPQ will be issued once the TAC for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year has been specified by the State of Alaska. All IFQ and IPQ for all persons will be issued once for a crab fishing year for a crab QS fishery. QS issued after NMFS has issued annual IFQ for a crab QS fishery for a crab fishing year will not result in IFQ for that crab QS fishery for that crab fishing year.

      (l)  QS and PQS allocated or permits issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the “takings” provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such QS, PQS, or permits represent only a harvesting or processing privilege that may be revoked or amended pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable law. IPQs do not create a right, title, or interest in any crab until that crab is purchased from a fisherman.

      (m)  (1) Beginning July 1, 2028, and each crab fishing year thereafter, individuals allocated CVC QS or CPC QS must meet the participation requirements set forth in paragraph (m)(2) of this section in order to retain their CVC QS or CPC QS unless the CVC QS holder or CPC QS holder meets the exemption provided in paragraph (m)(5) of this section.

      (2) During one of the 4 crab fishing years preceding the crab fishing year for which the individual is filing an annual crab IFQ permit application, the individual has participated as crew in at least:

      (i) One fishing trip where a delivery of crab is made in any CR fishery; or

      (ii) 30 days of:

      (A) Fishing in a commercial fishery managed by the State of Alaska or in a Federal commercial fishery in the EEZ off Alaska. Individuals may combine their participation as crew in State and Federal commercial fisheries to meet this requirement; or

      (B) On a tender vessel operating in support of a commercial fishery managed by the State of Alaska or in a Federal commercial fishery in the EEZ off Alaska. Individuals may combine their participation as crew on a tender vessel in State and Federal commercial fisheries to meet this requirement.

      (iii) Individuals may combine participation specified in paragraphs (m)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section to meet this requirement.

      (iv) If the individual holds CVC QS or CPC QS in one or more CR crab fisheries and all CR crab fisheries for which the QS holder holds QS are closed, NMFS will exclude that crab fishing year when determining whether the individual has satisfied the participation requirement specified in this paragraph (m)(2).

      (3) An individual issued a CVC QS or CPC QS permit may include information demonstrating compliance with the participation requirements in paragraph (m)(2) of this section with the individual's annual Application for Crab IFQ.

      (4) If an individual issued a CVC QS or CPC QS permit fails to meet the participation requirements in paragraph (m)(2) of this section or fails to qualify for the exemption in paragraph (m)(5) of this section, NMFS will revoke all of the individual's CVC QS or CPC QS in accordance with § 680.43.

      (5) All of the CVC QS or CPC QS permits held by the individual were acquired using the eligibility criteria in § 680.41(c)(1)(vii)(B) or reissued under paragraph (m)(6) of this section, and the person has held those CVC QS or CPC QS permits for less than 4 crab fishing years.

      (6) For CVC QS or CPC QS revoked by NMFS under regulations paragraph (m)(2) of this section from July 1, 2019, through May 31, 2024, an individual may apply for reissuance of QS with the individual's annual crab IFQ permit application from May 31, 2024 through June 15, 2025.

#### § § 680.42

      (a) —(1)  Separate and distinct _QS and IFQ use caps_ apply to all QS and IFQ categories pertaining to a given crab QS fishery with the following provisions:

      (i) A person who receives an initial allocation of QS that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may not receive QS by transfer unless and until that person's holdings are reduced to an amount below the use cap.

      (ii) A person will not be issued QS in excess of the use cap established in this section based on QS derived from landings attributed to an LLP license obtained via transfer after June 10, 2002 unless;

      (A) The person applies to receive QS based on an LLP transferred after June 10, 2002 but prior to November 24, 2004, and

      (B) The person will receive the amount of QS associated with that transferred LLP in excess of the use cap established in this section for a crab QS fishery solely because of the adjustment to legal landings available for QS allocation resulting from the BSAI Crab Capacity Reduction Program.

      (iii) QS and IFQ use caps shall be based on the initial QS pools used to determine initial allocations of QS.

      (2) Except for non-individual persons who hold PQS, as provided for in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or a CDQ group, as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a person, individually or collectively, may not:

      (i) Hold QS in amounts in excess of the amounts specified in the following table, unless that person's QS was received in the initial allocation:

      (ii) Use IFQ in excess of the amount of IFQ that results from the QS caps in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, unless that IFQ results from QS that was received by that person in the initial allocation of QS for that crab QS fishery.

      (3) A CDQ Group, individually or collectively, may not:

      (i) Hold QS in excess of the amounts of QS specified in the following table:

      (ii) Use IFQ in excess of the amount of IFQ that results from the QS caps in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, unless that IFQ results from QS that was received by that person in the initial allocation of QS for that crab QS fishery.

      (4) A person who is not an individual and who holds PQS may not:

      (i) Hold QS in excess of the amounts specified in the following table:

      (ii) Use IFQ in excess of the amount of IFQ that results from the QS caps in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, unless that IFQ results from QS that was received by that person in the initial allocation of QS for that crab QS fishery.

      (iii) A non-individual person that holds PQS, and all affiliates of that person, is limited to a QS and IFQ use cap that is calculated based on the sum of all QS or IFQ held by that PQS holder and all QS or IFQ held by any affiliate of the PQS holder.

      (5) IFQ that is used by a crab harvesting cooperative is not subject to the use caps in this paragraph (a) except as provided for in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

      (6) Non-individual persons holding QS will be required to provide, on an annual basis, a list of persons with an ownership interest in the non-individual QS holder. This list of owners shall be provided to the individual level and will include the percentage of ownership held by each individual. This annual submission of information must be submitted as part of the complete annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ permit.

      (7) In a calendar year, an entity as described in § 680.40(c)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(iii), or (c)(5)(iv), may not use more than 1,000,000 lb (453.6 mt) of IFQ derived from converted CPO QS in the BBR or BSS crab QS fisheries.

      (b)  (1) A person may not:

      (i) Hold PQS in excess of 30 percent of the initial PQS pool in any crab QS fishery unless that person received an initial allocation of PQS in excess of this limit. A person will not be issued PQS in excess of the use caps established in this section based on PQS derived from the transfer of legal processing history after June 10, 2002.

      (ii) Use IPQ in excess of the amount of IPQ that results from the PQS caps in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, unless that IPQ is:

      (A) Derived from PQS that was received by that person in the initial allocation of PQS for that crab QS fishery; or

      (B) Subject to an exemption for that IPQ pursuant to § 680.4(p); or

      (C) Used for custom processing at a facility that is:

      () Any shoreside crab processor located within the boundaries of a home rule, first class, or second class city in the State of Alaska in existence on June 29, 2009; or

      () Any stationary floating crab processor that is:

      () Located w_i_thin the boundaries of a home rule, first class, or second class city in the State of Alaska in existence on June 29, 2009;

      () Moored at a dock, docking facility, or at a permanent mooring buoy, unless that stationary floating crab processor is located within the boundaries of the city of Atka in which case that stationary floating crab processor is not required to be moored at a dock, docking facility, or at a permanent mooring buoy; and

      () Located within a harbor, unless that stationary floating crab processor is located within the boundaries of the city of Atka on June 29, 2009, in which case that stationary floating crab processor is not required to be located within a harbor.

      (2) A person may not use IPQ in excess of 60 percent of the IPQ issued in the BSS crab QS fishery with a North region designation during a crab fishing year. Except that a person who:

      (i) Holds IPQ; and

      (ii) Has a 10 percent or greater direct or indirect ownership interest in the shoreside crab processor or stationary floating crab processor where that IPQ crab is processed will not be considered to use any IPQ in the BSS crab QS fishery with a North region designation if that IPQ is custom processed at a facility consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.

      (3) A non-individual entity holding PQS will be required to provide, on an annual basis, a list of persons with an ownership interest in the non-individual entity. This ownership list shall be provided to the individual level, will include the percentage of ownership held by each owner, and must be submitted annually with the complete application for a crab IFQ/IPQ permit.

      (4) A person will be considered to be a holder of PQS for purposes of applying the PQS use caps in this paragraph if that person:

      (i) Is the sole proprietor of an entity that holds PQS; or

      (ii) Is not a CDQ group and directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in an entity that holds PQS.

      (5) A person that is not a CDQ group and holds PQS is limited to a PQS use cap that is calculated based on the sum of all PQS held by that PQS holder and all PQS held by any affiliate of the PQS holder. A person that is not a CDQ group and holds IPQ is limited to an IPQ use cap that is calculated based on the sum of all IPQ held by that IPQ holder and all IPQ held by any affiliate of the IPQ holder.

      (6) A CDQ group that holds PQS is limited to a PQS use cap that is calculated based on the sum of all PQS held, individually or collectively, by that CDQ group. A CDQ group that holds IPQ is limited to an IPQ use cap that is calculated based on the sum of all IPQ held, individually or collectively, by that CDQ group.

      (7) Before July 1, 2007, IPQ for the BSS, BBR, PIK, SMB, and EAG crab QS fisheries may not be used to process crab derived from PQS based on activities in an ECC, except in the geographic boundaries established in paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, except that, before July 1, 2007:

      (i) Ten percent of the IPQs that are issued for a crab QS fishery or an amount of IPQ that yields up to 500,000 raw crab pounds (226.7 mt) on an annual basis, whichever is less, may be leased for use in processing crab outside that ECC. The amount of IPQ that is issued on an annual basis for use in that ECC and the amount that may be leased outside that ECC will be established annually and will be divided on a pro rata basis among all PQS permit holders issued IPQ for use in that ECC for that year.

      (ii) IPQ in excess of the amounts specified in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section may be used outside the ECC for which that IPQ is designated if an unavoidable circumstance prevents crab processing within that ECC. For purposes of this section, an unavoidable circumstance exists if the specific intent to conduct processing for a crab QS species in that ECC was thwarted by a circumstance that was:

      (A) Unavoidable;

      (B) Unique to the IPQ permit holder, or to the processing facility used by the IPQ permit holder in that ECC;

      (C) Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the IPQ permit holder;

      (D) The circumstance that prevented the IPQ permit holder from processing crab in that ECC actually occurred; and

      (E) The IPQ permit holder took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the IPQ permit holder from conducting processing for that crab QS fishery in that ECC.

      (iii) This provision does not exempt any IPQ permit holder from any regional designation that may apply to that IPQ.

      (iv) Geographic boundaries for use of IPQ outside ECCs for purposes of this paragraph (b)(7):

      (A) Akutan, False Pass, King Cove, or Port Moller: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the Aleutians East Borough as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska;

      (B) Kodiak: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the Kodiak Island Borough as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska;

      (C) Adak: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of Adak as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska;

      (D) Unalaska/Dutch Harbor: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of Unalaska as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

      (E) St. George: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of St. George as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

      (F) St. Paul: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of St. Paul as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

      (8) Any person harvesting crab under a Class A CVO or Class A CVC IFQ Permit, except as provided under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, must deliver that crab:

      (i) Only to RCRs with unused IPQ for the same crab QS fishery; and

      (ii) Only to an RCR in the region for which the QS and IFQ is designated.

      (9) Any person harvesting crab under a Class B IFQ, CPO IFQ, CVC IFQ, or CPC IFQ permit may deliver that crab to any RCR.

      (c)  (1) Except for vessels that participate solely in a crab harvesting cooperative as described under § 680.21 and under the provisions described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, no vessel may be used to harvest CVO or CPO IFQ in excess of the following percentages of the TAC for that crab QS fishery for that crab fishing year:

      (i) 2.0 percent for BSS;

      (ii) 2.0 percent for BBR;

      (iii) 2.0 percent for EBT;

      (iv) 2.0 percent for WBT;

      (v) 4.0 percent for PIK;

      (vi) 4.0 percent for SMB;

      (vii) 20.0 percent for EAG;

      (viii) 20.0 percent for WAG; or

      (ix) 20.0 percent for the WAI crab QS fishery west of 179° W. long.

      (2) CVC or CPC IFQ used on a vessel will not be included in determining whether a vessel use cap is met.

      (3) A single person who receives an initial allocation of QS that results in IFQ that is in excess of the vessel use caps, in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that person may catch and retain crab harvested with the resulting IFQ with a single vessel. However, this provision does not apply to IFQ resulting from QS derived from transfer of an LLP crab license that occurred after June 10, 2002. Two or more persons may not catch and retain their IFQ with one vessel in excess of these limitations.

      (4) A vessel use cap would not apply to a vessel if all of the CVO or CPO IFQ used on that vessel in a crab fishing year is held by a crab harvesting cooperative. This exemption is forfeited if that vessel is used to harvest any amount of CVO or CPO IFQ not held by a crab harvesting cooperative during the same crab fishing year.

      (5) A person holding a CVC or CPC IFQ permit is required to be aboard the vessel upon which their IFQ is being harvested.

      (6) A person holding CVO or CPO QS does not have to be aboard the vessel being used to harvest their IFQ if they hold at least a 10 percent ownership interest in the vessel upon which the IFQ is to be harvested and are represented on board the vessel by a crab IFQ hired master employed by that QS holder as authorized under § 680.4.

      (7) Ownership of a vessel means, for purposes of this section:

      (i) A sole proprietor; or

      (ii) A person that directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in an entity that owns a vessel.

      § 680.43   Revocation of CVC and CPC QS.

#### § § 680.43

      (a) Beginning July 1, 2028, the Regional Administrator will revoke all CVC QS and CPC QS held by an individual who has not met the participation requirements set forth in § 680.40(m). The Regional Administrator will revoke an individual's CVC QS or CPC QS in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.

      (b)  The Regional Administrator will issue a Notice of C Share QS Inactivity to an individual holding CVC or CPC QS if, after reviewing the CVC or CPC QS holder's Applications for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, the Regional Administrator determines that the CVC or CPC QS holder has failed to meet the participation requirements in § 680.40(m). A CVC or CPC QS holder who receives such a Notice will have 60 days to provide the Regional Administrator with information demonstrating participation as crew that meets the requirements of § 680.40(m).

      (c)  The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the CVC or CPC QS holder following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the CVC or CPC QS holder fails to demonstrate participation as crew and is insufficient to rebut the information included in the CVC or CPC QS holder's Applications for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, or if the additional information or evidence is not provided within the time period specified in the Notice of C Share QS Inactivity. The IAD will explain the basis for the revocation determination. A CVC or CPC QS holder who receives an IAD for revocation may appeal under the appeals procedures set forth at 15 CFR part 906. A CVC or CPC QS holder who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD for revocation will not receive crab IFQ or IPQ until after the final resolution of that appeal in the QS holder's favor.

#### § § 680.44

      (a) —(1)  The person documented on the IFQ, IPQ, CDQ, RCR, Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC), or State of Alaska Commissioner's permit as the permit holder at the time of a CR crab landing must comply with the requirements of this section.

      (i) Subsequent transfer of IFQ, IPQ, CDQ, or QS does not affect the permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (ii) Non-renewal of an RCR permit does not affect the permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this section.

      (2)  (i) All CR allocation holders and RCR permit holders will be subject to a fee liability for any CR crab debited from a CR allocation during a crab fishing year, except for crab designated as personal use or deadloss, or crab confiscated by NMFS or the State of Alaska.

      (ii) Fee liability must be calculated by multiplying the applicable fee percentage by the ex-vessel value of the CR crab received by the RCR at the time of receipt, except as provided by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (iii) NMFS will provide a summary to all RCR permit holders during the last quarter of the crab fishing year. The summary will explain the fee liability determination including the current fee percentage, details of raw crab pounds debited from CR allocations by permit, port or port-group, species, date, and prices.

      (3)  (i) All RCRs who receive CR crab are responsible for submitting the cost recovery payment for all CR crab received.

      (ii) All RCRs who receive CR crab in a crab fishing year must maintain and submit records for any crab cost recovery fees collected under the corresponding RCR permit.

      (4) —(i)  An RCR permit holder must submit any crab cost recovery fee liability payment(s) to NMFS at the address provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section no later than July 31 of the crab fishing year following the crab fishing year in which the payment for a CR crab landing was made.

      (ii)  Make payment payable to NMFS.

      (iii)  Submit payment and related documents as instructed on the fee submission form. Payments may be made electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at  Instructions for electronic payment will be made available on both the payment Web site and a fee liability summary letter mailed to the RCR permit holder.

      (b) —(1)  An RCR permit holder must use either the ex-vessel value determined for shoreside processors or the ex-vessel value determined for at-sea Catcher/Processors (CP), depending on their activity. Ex-vessel value includes all cash, services, or other goods-in-kind exchanged for CR crab.

      (2)  Shoreside processing facilities must use the price paid at the time of purchase as ex-vessel value for the purposes of calculating fee liability. Shoreside processing facilities must include any subsequent retroactive payments as adjustments to the initial calculation of fee liability.

      (3) —(i)  Catcher/processors must use the corresponding CP standard price(s) for the purposes of calculating fee liability.

      (ii)  As part of the summary described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the Regional Administrator will provide CP standard prices calculated for the current year during the last quarter of each crab fishing year. The CP standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per raw crab pound, for CR crab debited from CR allocations during the current crab fishing year.

      (iii)  CP standard prices established by NMFS shall apply to all landings made in the same crab fishing year as the CP standard price provided for that year and shall replace any CP standard prices previously provided by NMFS.

      (iv)  NMFS will calculate the CP standard prices to reflect, as closely as possible, the current crab fishing year's average shoreside processor price by fishery and by species, and any variations in reported shoreside ex-vessel values of CR crab. The Regional Administrator will base CP standard prices on the following types of information:

      (A) Landed pounds by CR crab, port-group, and month;

      (B) Total shoreside ex-vessel value by CR crab, port-group, and month; and

      (C) Price adjustments, including retroactive payments.

      (4)  All RCRs must base all fee liability calculations on the ex-vessel value that correlates to CR crab that is debited from a CR allocation and recorded in raw crab pounds.

      (c) —(1)  The crab fee percentage is the amount as determined by the factors and methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This amount will be announced by publication in the  in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This amount must not exceed 3 percent pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).

      (i) The calculated crab fee percentage will be divided equally between the harvesting and processing sectors.

      (ii) Catcher/Processors must pay the full crab fee percentage determined by the fee percentage calculation for all CR crab debited from a CR allocation.

      (2)  Each year NMFS shall calculate and publish the fee percentage according to the following factors and methodology:

      (i)  NMFS must use the following factors to determine the fee percentage:

      (A) The catch to which the crab cost recovery fee will apply;

      (B) The ex-vessel value of that catch; and

      (C) The costs directly related to the management and enforcement of the Crab Rationalization Program.

      (ii)  NMFS must use the following equations to determine the fee percentage:

      (3) —(i)  During the first quarter of each crab fishing year, NMFS shall calculate the crab fee percentage based on the calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii)  The calculated IFQ fee percentage remains in effect through the end of the crab fishing year in which it was determined.

      (4)  The RCR permit holder must use the crab fee percentage in effect at the time a CR crab is debited from a CR allocation to calculate the crab cost recovery fee liability for such CR crab. The RCR permit holder must use the crab fee percentage in effect at the time a CR crab is debited from a CR allocation to calculate the crab cost recovery fee liability for any retroactive payments for that CR crab.

      (d)  (1) Under § 680.4, an applicant will not receive new IFQ, IPQ, or RCR permits until he or she submits a complete application. A complete application shall include full payment of an applicant's complete crab cost recovery fee liability as reported by the RCR.

      (2) If an RCR fails to submit full payment for crab cost recovery fee liability by the date described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:

      (i) At any time thereafter send an IAD to the RCR permit holder stating that the RCR permit holder's estimated fee liability, as indicated by his or her own submitted information, is the crab cost recovery fee liability due from the RCR permit holder.

      (ii) Disapprove any transfer of IFQ, IPQ, QS, or PQS to or from the RCR permit holder in accordance with § 680.41.

      (3) If an RCR fails to submit full payment by the application deadline described at § 680.4, no IFQ or IPQ permit will be issued to that RCR for that crab fishing year.

      (4) Upon final agency action determining that an RCR permit holder has not paid his or her crab cost recovery fee liability, the Regional Administrator may continue to withhold issuance of any new IFQ, IPQ, or RCR permit for any subsequent crab fishing years. If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action, the matter will be referred to the appropriate authorities for purposes of collection.

      (e)  Upon issuance of final agency action, any amount submitted to NMFS in excess of the crab cost recovery fee liability determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the RCR permit holder unless the permit holder requests the agency to credit the excess amount against the permit holder's future crab cost recovery fee liability.

      (f)  An RCR permit holder who receives an IAD may either appeal the IAD pursuant to 50 CFR 679.43 or request reconsideration. Within 60 days from the date of issuance of the IAD, the Regional Administrator may undertake reconsideration of the IAD on his or her own initiative. If a request for reconsideration is submitted or the Regional Administrator initiates reconsideration, the 60-day period for appeal under 50 CFR 679.43 will begin anew upon issuance of the Regional Administrator's reconsidered IAD. The Regional Administrator may undertake only one reconsideration of the IAD, if any. If an RCR permit holder fails to file an appeal of the IAD pursuant to 50 CFR 679.43 or request reconsideration within the time period provided, the IAD will become the final agency action. In any appeal or reconsideration of an IAD made under this section, an RCR permit holder has the burden of proving his or her claim.

      (g)  An RCR must submit an RCR permit holder fee submission form according to § 680.5(g).

      § 697.3   Relation to other Federal and state laws.

#### § § 697.3

      (a) The provisions of sections 307 through 311 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, as amended, regarding prohibited acts, civil penalties, criminal offenses, civil forfeitures, and enforcement apply with respect to the regulations in this part, as if the regulations in this part were issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

      (b) The relation of this part to other laws is further set forth in § 600.705 of this chapter and would include all regulations and statutes administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including, but not limited to the regulations in this part issued pursuant to the ACFCMA, the regulations at 50 CFR part 229 issued pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) , and the regulations at 50 CFR part 648 issued pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

      (c) The regulations in this part do not preempt more restrictive state laws, or state enforcement of more restrictive state laws, with respect to weakfish fishing and American lobster fishing. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement or measure.

      § 697.4   Vessel permits and trap tags.

#### § § 697.4

      (a)  Any vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster or Jonah crab in or harvested from the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal limited access lobster permit. The requirement in this paragraph (a) does not apply to: Charter, head, and commercial dive vessels that possess 6 or fewer American lobsters per person or 50 Jonah crab per person aboard the vessel if such lobsters or crabs are not intended for, nor used, in trade, barter or sale; recreational fishing vessels; and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobster or Jonah crab.

      (1)  To be eligible for issuance or renewal of a Federal limited access lobster permit, a vessel must:

      (i) Have been issued a Federal limited access lobster permit for the preceding fishing year by the last day of such fishing year unless a CPH has been issued as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section or unless otherwise authorized by the Regional Administrator;

      (ii) Be replacing a vessel that was issued a Federal limited access lobster permit for the preceding year; or

      (iii) Be replacing a vessel issued a CPH.

      (2)  Unless the Regional Administrator determines otherwise, no more than one vessel may qualify, at any one time, for a Federal limited access lobster permit based on that or another vessel's fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility for a limited access permit, based on one vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Administrator will determine who is eligible for the permit or a CPH under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (3)  The fishing and permit history, and management area designation, when required of a vessel, is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold or otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel's fishing and permit history, and management area designation, for the purposes of replacing the vessel.

      (4)  Federal limited access American lobster permits, and any rights or privileges associated thereto, may not be combined or consolidated.

      (5)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been destroyed, or transferred to another person, must apply for and receive a CPH if the fishing and permit history of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To be eligible to obtain a CPH, the applicant must show that the qualifying vessel meets the eligibility requirements, as applicable, in this part. Issuance of a valid CPH preserves the eligibility of the applicant to apply for a limited access permit for a replacement vessel based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history at a subsequent time, subject to the replacement provisions specified in this section. If fishing privileges have been assigned or allocated previously under this part, based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history, the CPH also preserves such fishing privileges. A CPH must be applied for in order for the applicant to preserve the fishing rights and limited access eligibility of the qualifying vessel. An application for a CPH must be received by the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days prior to the end of the first full fishing year in which a vessel permit cannot be issued. Failure to do so is considered abandonment of the permit as described in paragraph (o) of this section. A CPH issued under this part will remain valid until the fishing and permit history preserved by the CPH is used to qualify a replacement vessel for a limited access permit. Any decision regarding the issuance of a CPH for a qualifying vessel that has been applied for or been issued previously a limited access permit is a final agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704. Information requirements for the CPH application are the same as those for a limited access permit. Any request for information about the vessel on the CPH application form means the qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel permit applicants who have been issued a CPH and who wish to obtain a vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the previous vessel history may do so pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (6)  A Federal limited access lobster permit will not be issued to a vessel or its replacement, or remain valid, if the vessels' permit or fishing history has been used to qualify another vessel for another Federal fishery.

      (7)  (i) It is unlawful for vessels issued a limited access American lobster permit fishing with traps, to retain on board, land, or possess American lobster in or from the management areas specified in § 697.18, unless such fishing vessel has been issued a valid management area designation certificate or valid limited access American lobster permit specifying such management area(s).

      (ii) Each owner of a fishing vessel that fishes with traps capable of catching lobster must declare to NMFS in his/her annual application for permit renewal which management areas, as described in § 697.18, the vessel will fish in for lobster with trap gear during that fishing season. A federal lobster permit holder may declare into Lobster Conservation Management Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or the Outer Cape Management Area to fish with traps, only in the following two circumstances:

      (A) The NOAA Regional Administrator previously qualified the permit into the requested area as part of the Area 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and/or Outer Cape Cod Limited Access Program during the initial limited access area qualification process; and/or

      (B) The permit holder, even if the permit has not qualified as described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, is seeking access to Area 2, 3, and/or the Outer Cape Area based upon ownership of traps acquired as part of the Trap Transfer Program, described in § 697.27, that the NOAA Regional Administrator has previously qualified and allocated under the Area 2, 3, and/or the Outer Cape Cod Limited Access Programs.

      (iii) A lobster management area designation certificate or limited access American lobster permit shall specify in which lobster management area or areas the vessel may fish.

      (iv) Once a vessel has been issued a lobster management area designation certificate or limited access American lobster permit specifying the lobster EEZ management areas in which the vessel may fish, no changes to the EEZ management areas specified may be made for such vessel for the remainder of the fishing year. There are two exceptions to this re-designation restriction:

      (A) Vessels that have been bought, transferred, or become a replacement vessel for another qualified vessel may request re-designation of the EEZ management areas within 45 days of the effective date of the vessel's permit; and

      (B) All vessels will have one opportunity to request a correction in permit category, if such request is made in writing to the Regional Administrator within 45 days of the effective date of the vessel's permit.

      (v) A vessel issued a lobster management area designation certificate or limited access American lobster permit specifying more than one EEZ management area must abide by the most restrictive management measures in effect for any one of the specified areas, regardless of the area being fished, for the entire fishing year.

      (vi)-(viii) [Reserved]

      (b)  Vessel owners who apply for a Federal limited access American lobster permit under this section must agree, as a condition of the permit, that the vessel and vessel's fishing, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part, as well as gear, time, and area restrictions issued or set forth in other parts, including, but not limited to, 50 CFR parts 229 and 648. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement.

      (c)  Applicants for a Federal limited access American lobster permit under this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form obtained from the Regional Administrator. To be complete, an application for a Federal limited access American lobster permit must contain at least the following information, and any other information specified on the application form or otherwise required by the Regional Administrator: Vessel name; owner name, mailing address, and telephone number; U.S. Coast Guard documentation number and a copy of the vessel's U.S. Coast Guard documentation or, if undocumented, state registration number and a copy of the state registration; lobster management area designation the vessel will fish in, as specified in § 697.18, if fishing with traps capable of catching American lobster; home port and principal port of landing; overall length; gross tonnage; net tonnage; engine horsepower; year the vessel was built; type of construction; type of propulsion; approximate fish-hold capacity; type of fishing gear used by the vessel; number of crew; permit category; if the owner is a corporation, a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation; and the names and addresses of all shareholders owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if the owner is a partnership, a copy of the Partnership Agreement and the names and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, names of all owners having more than a 25 percent interest; and name and signature of the owner or the owner's authorized representative. The application must be signed by the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, and be submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which the permit is needed by the applicant. The Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant of any deficiency in the application.

      (d)  (1) Any lobster trap fished in Federal waters must have a valid Federal lobster trap tag permanently attached to the trap bridge or central cross-member, unless exempt under § 697.26.

      (2) Trap tags shall be issued by the Regional Administrator, or, by state agencies, by agreement with the Regional Administrator, provided that such state tagging programs accurately identify the Federal limited access American lobster permit holder. NMFS will provide notice to American lobster permit holders as to the procedure for applying for trap tags and any required fees.

      (3) Vessel owners or operators are required to report to the Regional Administrator lost, destroyed, and missing tags as soon as feasible within 7 days after the tags have been discovered lost, destroyed, or missing, by letter or fax to the Regional Administrator.

      (4) Requests for replacement of lost tags in excess of the tag limit specified in § 697.19(c) must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator on an appropriate form obtained from the Regional Administrator and signed by the permit holder or authorized representative. The form and request for replacement tags will be reviewed by the Regional Administrator on a case-by-case basis and a decision will be reached on the number of replacement tags to be issued, if any. A check for the cost of the replacement tags must be received before tags will be re-issued.

      (e)  The Regional Administrator may charge a fee to recover the administrative expenses of issuing a permit or trap tags required under this section. Fee amounts shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional Administrator, for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. Fees may not exceed such costs and shall be specified with each application form. The applicable fee must accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. Any fee paid by an insufficiently funded commercial instrument shall render any permit issued on the basis thereof null and void.

      (f)  (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, the Regional Administrator shall issue a permit or tags, as applicable, within 30 days of receipt of the application unless:

      (i) The applicant has failed to submit a complete application. An application is complete when all requested forms, information, documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received and the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in paragraph (q) of this section.

      (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Administrator by any applicable deadline set forth in this section;

      (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all applicable eligibility requirements set forth in this section or the number of tags requested exceeds the applicable tag limit specified in § 697.19(c);

      (iv) The applicant has failed to meet any other application or tag requirements stated in this part.

      (2)  Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed application for any permit under this part, the Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant of the deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.

      (g)  A permit expires annually upon the renewal date specified in the permit.

      (h)  A permit will continue in effect until the renewal date unless it is revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in the information on the permit application to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (k) of this section.

      (i)  A vessel permit may be reissued by the Regional Administrator when requested in writing by the owner or authorized representative, stating the need for reissuance, the name of the vessel, and the number of the permit requested to be reissued. An application for a reissued permit is not considered a new application. The fee for a reissued permit shall be the same as for an initial permit.

      (j)  A permit issued under this part is not transferable or assignable. A permit will be valid only for the fishing vessel, owner and/or person for which it is issued.

      (k)  Within 15 days after a change in the information contained in an application submitted under this section, a written notice of the change must be submitted to the Regional Administrator. If the written notice of the change in information is not received by the Regional Administrator within 15 days, the permit is void.

      (l)  Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.

      (m)  A vessel permit must be carried, at all times, on board the vessel for which it is issued and shall be subject to inspection upon request by any authorized officer. Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in legible condition.

      (n)  Permits issued or sought under this section may be suspended, revoked, or modified, by procedures governing enforcement-related permit sanctions and denials, found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

      (o)  Failure to renew a limited access permit in any fishing year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years. If a vessel's Federal limited access American lobster permit or CPH is voluntarily relinquished to the Regional Administrator, or abandoned through failure to renew or otherwise, no Federal limited access American lobster permit or CPH may be reissued or renewed based on the qualifying vessel's history.

      (p)  A vessel permit category change (for individuals who possess a dual Federal limited access permit for American lobster and black sea bass and who restrict fishing operations to Area 5) may be issued by the Regional Administrator when requested in writing by the owner or by an authorized representative of a vessel meeting the eligibility requirements under § 697.26(a).

      (q) —(1)  Beginning April 1, 2024, all federally permitted lobster vessels must maintain onboard the vessel and submit an electronic fishing log to NMFS for each fishing trip.

#### § § 697.5

      (a)  Any operator of a vessel issued a Federal limited access American lobster permit under § 697.4(a), or any operator of a vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobsters or Jonah crabs, harvested in or from the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid operator's permit issued under this section. The requirement in this paragraph (a) does not apply to: Charter, head, and commercial dive vessels that possess six or fewer American lobsters per person aboard the vessel if said lobsters are not intended for nor used in trade, barter or sale; recreational fishing vessels; and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobster.

      (b)  Applicants for a permit under this section must submit a completed permit application on an appropriate form obtained from the Regional Administrator. To be complete, an application must contain at least the following information, and any other information specified on the application form or otherwise required by the Regional Administrator: Name, mailing address, and telephone number; date of birth; hair color; eye color; height; weight; social security number (optional) and signature of the applicant. The applicant must also provide two recent (no more than 1 year old) color passport-size photographs. The application must be signed by the applicant and submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the application.

      (c)  Vessel operators who apply for an operator's permit under this section must agree, as a condition of this permit, that the operator and vessels fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part while fishing in the EEZ or on board a vessel permitted under § 697.4. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear will remain subject to all applicable state or local requirements. Further, such operators must agree, as a condition of this permit, that if the permit is suspended or revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot be on board any fishing vessel issued a Federal fisheries permit or any vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations while the vessel is at sea or engaged in off loading. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any operator issued a permit under this part must comply with the more restrictive requirement or measure.

      (d)  The Regional Administrator may charge a fee to recover the administrative expenses of issuing a permit required under this section. The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional Administrator, for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and shall be specified with each application form. The applicable fee must accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section. Any fee paid by an insufficiently funded commercial instrument shall render any permit issued on the basis thereof null and void.

      (e)  Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, the Regional Administrator shall issue an operator's permit within 30 days of receipt of the application if the criteria specified herein are met. Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed application, the Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of the deficiency in the application. If the application fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.

      (f)  A permit expires upon the renewal date specified in the permit.

      (g)  An operator permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or modified under subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or the applicant has failed to report a change in the information on the permit application to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

      (h)  An operator permit may be reissued by the Regional Administrator when requested in writing by the applicant, stating the need for reissuance and the number of the permit requested to be reissued. An applicant for a reissued operator permit must also provide two recent (no more than 1 year old) color passport-size photos of the applicant. An application for a reissued permit is not considered a new application. An appropriate fee may be charged.

      (i)  Permits issued under this section are not transferable or assignable. A permit is valid only for the person to whom it is issued.

      (j)  Notice of a change in the permit holder's name, address, or telephone number must be submitted in writing to, and received by, the Regional Administrator within 15 days of the change in information. If written notice of the change in information is not received by the Regional Administrator within 15 days, the permit is void.

      (k)  Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.

      (l)  Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in legible condition and displayed for inspection upon request by any authorized officer.

      (m)  Vessel operators with suspended or revoked permits may not be on board a federally permitted fishing vessel in any capacity while the vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading. Permits issued or sought under this section may be suspended, revoked, or modified, by procedures governing enforcement-related permit sanctions and denials, found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

      (n)  Vessel owners are responsible for ensuring that their vessels are operated by an individual with a valid operator's permit issued under this section.

      (i) Jonah crabs that are possessed, or landed at or prior to the time when the Jonah crabs are received by a dealer, or Jonah crabs that are possessed by a dealer, are presumed to have been harvested from the EEZ or by a vessel with a Federal limited access American lobster permit. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such Jonah crabs were harvested by a vessel without a Federal limited access American lobster permit and fishing exclusively for Jonah crabs in state or foreign waters will be sufficient to rebut this presumption.

      (ii) The possession of egg-bearing female Jonah crabs in violation of the requirements set forth in § 697.20(h)(1) or Jonah crabs that are smaller than the minimum sizes set forth in § 697.20(h)(2), will be prima facie evidence that such Jonah crabs were taken or imported in violation of these regulations. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such Jonah crabs were harvested by a vessel not holding a permit under this part and fishing exclusively within state or foreign waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

      (b)  The Area 2 trap limit is 800 traps. Federally permitted lobster fishing vessels may only fish with traps that have been previously qualified and allocated into Area 2 by the Regional Administrator, as part of the Federal Area 2 Limited Access Program. This allocation may be modified by trap cuts and/or trap transfers, but in no case shall the allocation exceed the trap limit.

      (c)  The Area 3 trap limit is 1,945 traps. Federally permitted lobster fishing vessels may only fish with traps that have been previously qualified and allocated into Area 3 by the Regional Administrator, as part of the Federal Area 3 Limited Access Program. This allocation may be modified by trap cuts and/or trap transfers, but in no case shall the allocation exceed the trap limit.

      (d)  The Area 4 trap limit is 1,440 traps. Federally permitted lobster fishing vessels may only fish with traps that have been previously qualified and allocated into Area 4 by the Regional Administrator, as part of the Federal Area 4 Limited Access Program. This allocation may be modified by trap cuts and/or trap transfers, but in no case shall the allocation exceed the trap limit.

      (e)  The Area 5 trap limit is 1,440 traps, unless the vessel is operating under an Area 5 Trap Waiver permit issued under § 697.26. Federally permitted lobster fishing vessels may only fish with traps that have been previously qualified and allocated into Area 5 by the Regional Administrator, as part of the Federal Area 5 Limited Access Program. This allocation may be modified by trap cuts and/or trap transfers, but in no case shall the allocation exceed the trap limit.

      (f)  The Outer Cape Area trap limit is 800 traps. Federally permitted lobster fishing vessels may only fish with traps that have been previously qualified and allocated into the Outer Cape Area by the Regional Administrator, as part of the Federal Outer Cape Cod Area Limited Access Program. This allocation may be modified by trap cuts and/or trap transfers, but in no case shall the allocation exceed the trap limit.

      (g)  Trap allocations shall be reduced in the following Areas as set forth below:

      (1) Area 2 allocations shall be reduced according to the following schedule:

      (2) Area 3 allocations shall be reduced according to the following schedule:

      (h)  A vessel owner who elects to fish in more than one EEZ Management Area is restricted to the lowest trap cap and/or trap allocation of all the areas designated on the permit and may not fish with, deploy in, possess in, or haul back from any of those elected management areas more lobster traps than the lowest number of lobster traps allocated to that vessel for any one elected management area.

      (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision, any vessel with a Federal lobster permit and a New Hampshire Full Commercial Lobster license may fish up to a maximum of 1,200 lobster traps in New Hampshire state waters, to the extent authorized by New Hampshire lobster fishery regulations. However, such vessel may not fish, possess, deploy, or haul back more than 800 lobster traps in the Federal waters of EEZ Nearshore Management Area 1, and may not fish more than a combined total of 1,200 lobster traps in the Federal and New Hampshire state waters portions of EEZ Nearshore Management Area 1.

      (j)  All lobster traps in Federal waters must have a valid Federal lobster trap tag permanently attached to the trap bridge or central cross-member. Federal lobster permit holders are eligible to receive Area 1 trap tags only if the Regional Administrator has qualified the permit to fish in Area 1 as part of the Federal Area 1 Limited Entry Program. Federal lobster permit holders are eligible to receive Area 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or Outer Cape Area trap tags only if the Regional Administrator has allocated those traps as part of the Federal Area 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or Outer Cape Area Limited Access Program. Any vessel with a Federal lobster permit may not possess, deploy, or haul back lobster traps in any portion of any lobster management area that do not have a valid, federally recognized trap tag permanently attached to the trap bridge or central cross-member.

      (k)  In any fishing year, the maximum number of tags authorized for direct purchase by each permit holder is the applicable trap limit specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section plus an additional 10 percent to cover trap loss.

      § 697.27   Trap transferability.

#### § § 697.27

      (a) Federal lobster permit holders may elect to participate in a program that allows them to transfer trap allocation to other participating Federal lobster permit holders, subject to the following conditions:

      (1)  To be eligible to participate in the Federal Trap Transfer Program:

      (i) An individual must possess a valid Federal lobster permit; and

      (ii) If the individual is dually permitted with both Federal and state lobster licenses, the individual must agree to synchronize his or her state and Federal allocations in each area for which there is an allocation. This synchronization shall be set at the lower of the state or Federal allocation in each area. This provision does not apply to Areas 1 and 6 as neither area have a Federal trap allocation.

      (iii) Individuals participating in the Lobster Management Area 1 trap fishery may participate in the Trap Transfer Program, but doing so may result in forfeiture of future participation in the Area 1 trap fishery as follows:

      (A) Area 1 fishers may accept, receive, or purchase trap allocations up to their Area 1 trap limit identified in § 697.19 and fish with that allocation both in Area 1 and the other area or areas subject to the restrictive provisions of § 697.3 and § 697.4(a)(7)(v).

      (B) Area 1 fishers with trap allocations in Areas 2, 3, and/or the Outer Cape Area may transfer away or sell any portion of that allocation, but, in so doing, the Area 1 fisher shall forfeit any right to fish in Area 1 with traps in the future.

      (2)  Trap allocation transfers will be allowed subject to the following conditions:

      (i)  Participants with dual state and Federal permits may participate in the Trap Transfer Program each year, but their state and Federal trap allocations must be aligned as required in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section at the start and close of each trap transfer period.

      (ii)  Buyers and sellers may only transfer trap allocations from Lobster Management Areas 2, 3, and the Outer Cape Area.

      (iii)  The permit holder transferring trap allocations shall have his or her remaining Federal trap allocation in all Lobster Conservation Management Areas debited by the total amount of allocation transferred. This provision does not apply to Areas 1 and 6, as neither area have a Federal trap allocation. A seller may not transfer a trap allocation if, after the transfer is debited, the allocation in any remaining Lobster Conservation Management Area would be below zero.

      (iv)  In a partial trap transfer, where the transfer is occurring independent of a Federal lobster permit transfer, the permit holder receiving the transferred allocation shall have his or her allocation credited as follows:

      (A)  All permit holders receiving trap allocation transfers shall retire 10 percent of that transferred allocation from the fishery for conservation. This provision does not pertain to full business transfers where the transfer includes the transfer of a Federal lobster permit and all traps associated with that permit.

      (B)  To the extent that transferred trap allocations have been granted access into multiple management areas, the recipient may elect any and all management areas for which the traps have demonstrated history.

      (C) All trap allocation transfers are subject to whatever trap allocation cap exists in the involved lobster management area. No participant may receive a transfer that, when combined with existing allocation, would put that permit holder's trap allocation above the involved trap caps in § 697.19.

      (v) In all allocation transfers, the buyer's and seller's initial allocations shall be calculated as being the allocation that the buyer and seller would otherwise have on the last day of the fishing year.

      (vi) Trap allocations may be transferred in any increment.

      (vii) Trap allocation transfers must be approved by the Regional Administrator before becoming effective. The Regional Administrator shall approve a transfer upon a showing by the involved permit holders of the following:

      (A) The proposed transfer is documented in a legible written agreement signed and dated by the involved permit holders. The agreement must identify the amount of allocation being transferred as well as the Federal lobster permit number from which the allocation is being taken and the Federal lobster permit number that is receiving the allocation. If the transfer involves parties who also possess a state lobster license, the parties must identify the state lobster license number and state of issuance.

      (B) That the transferring permit holder has sufficient allocation to transfer and that the permit holder's post-transfer allocation is clear and agreed to. In determining whether seller has sufficient allocation to transfer, the Regional Administrator will calculate the seller's pre-transfer and post-transfer allocations. The pre-transfer allocation shall be the amount of the seller's allocation as it would exist on the last day of the fishing year. The post-transfer allocation shall be the pre-transfer allocation minus the total amount of traps being transferred prior to application of the 10-percent trap retirement set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.

      (C) That the permit holder receiving the transfer has sufficient room under any applicable trap cap identified in § 697.19 to receive the transferred allocation and that the recipient's post-transfer allocation is clear and agreed to. In determining whether the buyer has sufficient room to receive allocation, the Regional Administrator will calculate the buyer's pre-transfer and post-transfer allocations. The pre-transfer allocation shall be the amount of the buyer's allocation as it would exist on the last day of the fishing year. The post-transfer allocation shall be the pre-transfer allocation plus the total amount of traps being transferred minus 10 percent of the transferred allocation that shall be retired pursuant to the provisions of (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.

      (3)  The timing of the Trap Transfer Program is as follows:

      (i) Federal lobster permit holders must declare their election into the program in writing to the NMFS Permit Office. Electing into the Trap Transfer Program is a one-time declaration, and the permit holder may participate in the program in later years without needing to re-elect into the program year after year. Federal permit holders may elect into the program at any time in any year, but their ability to actively transfer traps will be limited by the timing restrictions identified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      (ii) All trap transfer requests must be made in writing before September 30 each year, and if approved, will become effective at the start of the next fishing year. The Regional Administrator shall attempt to review, reconcile and notify the transferring parties of the disposition of the requested transfer before December 31 each year. Transfers are not valid until approved by the Regional Administrator.

      (iii)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the timing of the first year of the Trap Transfer Program is linked to the completion of the Commission's Trap Tag Database. NMFS will analyze the Trap Tag Database and when NMFS finds that the database is capable of tracking transfers for multiple jurisdictions, then NMFS will file a notice alerting the public of the date of when the Trap Transfer Program will begin.

      § 697.28   Atlantic migratory group cobia.

#### § § 697.28

      (a)  The fishing year for Atlantic migratory cobia is January 1 through December 31.

      (b)  Subject to the prohibitions on gear/methods in § 697.7, the following are the only fishing gears that may be used for cobia in the EEZ of the Atlantic migratory group—automatic reel, bandit gear, handline, rod and reel, pelagic longline, and spear (including powerheads).

      (c)  All size limits in this section are minimum size limits. Atlantic migratory group cobia not in compliance with its size limit, as specified in this section, in or from the EEZ, may not be possessed, sold, or purchased. A fish not in compliance with its size limit must be released immediately with a minimum of harm. The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for ensuring that fish on board are in compliance with the size limits specified in this section. If a size limit in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section differs from a size limit from an Atlantic state(s), then any vessel operator in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement or measure when in the waters off that state.

      (1) 33 inches (83.8), fork length, for cobia that are sold (commercial sector).

      (2) 36 inches (91.4 cm), fork length, for cobia that are not sold (recreational sector).

      (d)  Atlantic migratory group cobia in the EEZ, must be maintained with head and fins intact. Such fish may be eviscerated, gilled, and scaled, but must otherwise be maintained in a whole condition. The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for ensuring that fish on that vessel in the EEZ are maintained intact and, if taken from the EEZ, are maintained intact through offloading ashore, as specified in this section.

      (e)  If a bag and/or possession limit in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section differs from a bag and/or possession limit from an Atlantic state(s), then any vessel operator in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement or measure when in the waters off that state.

      (1)  Atlantic migratory group cobia that are not sold (recreational sector)—1, not to exceed 6 fish per vessel per day.

      (2)  A person who is on a trip that spans more than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided such trip is on a vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, the vessel has two licensed operators aboard, and each passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the length of the trip.

      (f)  All weights are in round and eviscerated weight combined.

      (1)  The following quota applies to persons who fish for cobia for commercial purposes—73,116 lb (33,165 kg). If the sum of the cobia landings that are sold, as estimated by the ASMFC, reach or are projected to reach the quota specified in this paragraph (f)(1), then the ASMFC will notify NMFS of the need for a commercial closure of the EEZ. NMFS will then subsequently file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to prohibit (for commercial purposes) the harvest, sale, trade, barter, or purchase of cobia for the remainder of the fishing year.

      (2)  (i) If the recreational sector for Atlantic migratory group cobia is open, the bag and possession specified in paragraph (e) of this section apply to all harvest or possession in or from the EEZ. If the recreational sector is closed, all applicable harvest or possession in or from the EEZ is prohibited.

      (ii) The sale or purchase of Atlantic migratory group cobia in or from the EEZ during a closure is prohibited. The prohibition on the sale or purchase during a closure does not apply to Atlantic migratory group cobia that were harvested, landed ashore, and sold prior to the effective date of the closure and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.

      (g)  Commercial trip limits are limits on the amount of Atlantic migratory group cobia that may be possessed on board or landed, purchased, or sold from a vessel per day. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a trip limit specified in this section with any trip or possession limit applicable to state waters. Atlantic migratory group cobia specified in this section taken in the EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes place, and such species may not be transferred in the EEZ. Commercial trip limits apply as follows—Until the commercial quota specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is reached, 2 fish per person, not to exceed 6 fish per vessel.
