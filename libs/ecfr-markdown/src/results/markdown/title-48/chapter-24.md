### Part 2401

**Authority:** Authority: 40 U.S.C. 121(c); 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart 2401.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance

        2401.100   Scope of subpart.

#### § 2401.100

        This subpart describes the HUDAR and states its relationship to the FAR System. This subpart also provides the explanation of the purpose and the authorities under which the HUDAR is issued.

        2401.101   Purpose.

#### § 2401.101

        The Department of Housing and Urban Development Acquisition Regulation is hereby established as chapter 24 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System (48 CFR chapter 24). It is issued to provide uniform Departmental policies and procedures for the acquisition of supplies, personal property and non-personal services by the Department's contracting activities and to make these policies and procedures readily available to Departmental personnel and to the public.

        2401.103   Authority.

#### § 2401.103

        The HUDAR is prescribed under section 7(d) of the Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)), section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), the general authorization in FAR 1.301, and the Secretary's delegations of procurement authority.

> [71 FR 2434, Jan. 13, 2006]

        2401.104   Applicability.

#### § 2401.104

        All acquisition of personal property and non-personal services (including construction) by HUD, except as may be otherwise authorized by law, must be accomplished in accordance with the HUDAR and the FAR.

> [49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]

        2401.105   Issuance.

#### § 2401.105

        2401.105-2   Arrangement of regulations.

#### § 2401.105-2

        (a)  Chapter 24 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs and further subdivisions as necessary.

        (b)  Generally, the numbering system and part, subpart, and section titles used in the HUDAR conform with those used in the FAR or as follows:

        (1) When the HUDAR implements or deviates from a parallel part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementation or deviation will be numbered and captioned where possible to correspond to the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph. For example, FAR subpart 1.4, Deviations, is implemented in HUD's acquisition regulations at subpart 2401.4, Deviations. (The “24” in the number indicates what chapter of title 48 contains the HUDAR.)

        (2) When HUD supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given a unique number containing the numerals “70” or higher. The rest of the number will parallel the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph it is supplementing. For example, FAR 14.407, Award, does not contain a provision for the steps to be taken when only one bid is received. The HUDAR provides this information. Since the subject matter supplements what is contained in FAR 14.407, the HUDAR section supplementing the FAR is numbered 2414.407-70.

        (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or deviation, there is no corresponding numbering in the HUDAR. Therefore, there may be gaps in the HUDAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as written, is applicable to the HUDAR and requires no further implementation.

        (c)  The HUDAR will be cited in accordance with  standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when referred to in the HUDAR is cited as 2401.105-2(c). When this section is referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it should be cited as “48 CFR 2401.105-2(c).” Any section of the HUDAR may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., “HUDAR 2401.105-2.” In the HUDAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated by “FAR” followed by the section number, for example FAR 37.108.

> [49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 58 FR 49437, Sept. 23, 1993. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 46094, Aug. 23, 1999]

        2401.106   OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § 2401.106

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from 10 or more persons. HUD has received approval from OMB to collect information under the provisions of its Acquisition Regulation. The OMB Approval Number is 2535-0091.

        (d) Supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices. Services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates, or at fixed price for performance of a specific task ( installation, maintenance, and repair). GSA has determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, to be fair and reasonable for the purpose of establishing the schedule contract.

Contracting Officers shall follow the general principles and techniques outlined in FAR Section 15.404-1, Proposal Analysis Techniques, to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable, keeping in mind that the complexity and circumstances of each acquisition should determine the level of detail of the analysis required.

        2409.105   Procedures.

#### § 2409.105

        (a) The Contracting Officer shall perform a financial review when the Contracting Officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, the Contracting Officer shall consider performing a financial review—

        (1) Prior to award of a contract, when—

        (i) The contractor is on a list requiring pre-award clearance or other special clearance before award;

        (ii) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government, or is otherwise known to be indebted to the Government;

        (iii) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract financing payments or Government property;

        (iv) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or

        (v) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.

        (2) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when—

The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects for contract completion.

        (c) The Contracting Officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the Contracting Officer concludes that information not listed herein is required to determine financial responsibility, that information should be requested.

        (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.

        (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or personal, and describing its products or services.

        (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing—

        (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;

        (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;

        (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, members, directors, major stockholders; and

        (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-traded, publicly-held corporation.

        (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate—

        (i) Planned for the current year;

        (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and

        (iii) Deferred to future periods.

        (5) Business base and forecast that—

        (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and

        (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.

        (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract.

        (7) Financing arrangement information that discloses—

        (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;

        (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's demands;

        (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with Government title terms under contract financing;

        (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable qualifications; and

        (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/repayment suspensions.

        (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, including special mandatory contributions,  environmental superfund.

        (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues such as—

        (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty arrangements;

        (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;

        (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or contractor debt load;

        (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;

        (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, environmental, or product liabilities;

        (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, as assets; and

        (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.

        (10) Significant ratios such as—

        (i) Inventory to annual sales;

        (ii) Inventory to current assets;

        (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;

        (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;

        (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and

#### § 2417.204

        (e)(1) The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is authorized to approve contract periods for other than information technology contracts that exceed the 5-year limit set forth at FAR 17.204(e) that are not otherwise limited by statute (e.g., the Service Contract Act). Except as provided for in paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of this section, the SPE shall approve any contract period that will exceed 5 years, including all option periods, prior to the award of the basic contract.

        (2) With regard to HUD indefinite-delivery contracts, the “contract period” requiring the SPE's prior approval in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall mean the ordering period of a contract. Unless otherwise specified within the contract, the 5-year limit shall not apply to the period that any task or delivery order issued within the contract's ordering period extends beyond the final end date of the contract's ordering period, regardless of whether the performance period of the order causes the total period of the contract to exceed 5 years. The issuance of any such task or delivery order does not require the SPE's approval. Task or delivery orders with end dates extending beyond the ordering period of the contract may not exceed the final delivery date that the contracting officer has stated in the applicable indefinite-delivery FAR clause included in the contract (i.e., 52.216-20, “Definite Quantity,” paragraph (d); 52.216-21, “Requirements,” paragraph (f); or 52.216-22, “Indefinite Quantity,” paragraph (d)).

        (3) The SPE's authority described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section shall not be used as the basis to retroactively increase or extend the period of any existing contract.

        (4) The SPE is not required to approve any option properly exercised pursuant to the FAR clause at 52.217-8, “Option to Extend Services,” that extends the contract period beyond 5 years; provided that the total length of all options exercised pursuant to FAR clause 52.217-8 may not exceed 6 months; and provided that exercise of any such options shall be in accordance with FAR 37.111. Any proposed extension of a contract beyond the 6-month maximum permitted by FAR 52.217-8 shall be considered a new requirement and shall be subject to the competition requirements of FAR part 6.

Under the Partnership Agreement, a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole-source or competitive basis.
