The reimbursement cost is prorated to participating agencies by means of a per capital formula computed by dividing the operating budget of the health service by the total number of employees sponsored for service. The size of the Federal population served, the compensation of the employees of the health unit, and other factors of medical economics prevalent in the area are factors which affect the local reimbursement cost. Further, in appropriate cases where more than one health unit is servicing employees housed in the same general locality, costs may be equalized by combining the operating budgets of all such units and dividing the total of the operating budgets by the number of employees sponsored. Special industrial conditions or other abnormal health or accident risk environments may increase the per capita cost.\n"

In such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.\n"

                      "(b) Under the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP systems, the requisitions submitted to GSA are not required to reflect the applicable appropriation or fiscal year funds to be charged. The fund code entry on the requisition simply indicates to the supply source (GSA) that funds are available to pay the charge, thereby providing authority for the release of material and subsequent billing. Requisitions received by GSA in purchase authority format are normally converted to FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP documentation so that processing can be accomplished expeditiously through a uniform system based on the use of automated equipment. Accordingly, primary responsibility rests with the ordering activity for ensuring that requisitions intended to be chargeable to appropriations expiring the last day of the fiscal year are submitted in sufficient time for GSA to consummate the necessary action before the end of the fiscal year. Requisitions submitted on or before the last day of the fiscal year may be chargeable to appropriations expiring on that date provided the ordering agency is required by law or GSA regulation to use GSA supply sources. When the ordering agency is not required to use GSA sources, requisitions for GSA stock items may be recorded as obligations provided the items are intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the need arises or to replace stock used in that fiscal year; requests for other than GSA stock items are to be recorded as obligations at the time GSA awards a contract for the required items. In the latter case, GSA procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, should be used as a guide for timely submission of these requisitions. The leadtimes referred to relate to the number of days between submission of a requisition and actual delivery of the items involved. While this may furnish some guidance to requisitioners, there is no direct relationship between those leadtimes and the time it takes for GSA to make an award of a contract.\n",
                      "(c) End-of-year submission of requisitions which require GSA to award a contract not later than the last day of the fiscal year in order to obligate the appropriation or funds of the ordering agency will be annotated to indicate that GSA procurement of the requested items must be accomplished not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which the requisitions are submitted. For example, a FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP requisition should be prepared to include Document Identifier Code A0E or A05 and reflect the annotation in the “Remarks” block. With this information GSA will attempt to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year. When a requistion is received too late to permit GSA to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year, the requisitioning activity will be so notified and requested to furnish instructions regarding the action to be taken. Based on these instructions, procurement action will be taken or the requisition will be canceled and returned to the ordering activity.\n"

This analysis shall be made as follows:\n",

However, such items shall be viewed again during the last month of the shelf-life period to determine whether quantities are sufficient to warrant inspection. The guidelines in § 101-27.207-2 shall be used to determine whether quantities are sufficient to warrant inspection and for extending the shelf-life period.\n",
