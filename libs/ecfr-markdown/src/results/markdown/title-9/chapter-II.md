    Subpart D—Registration

      § 201.10   Requirements and procedures.

#### § § 201.10

      (a) Every person operating or desiring to operate as a market agency or dealer as defined in section 301 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 201) must apply for registration. To apply, such persons must file a properly executed application for registration on a form furnished by the Agency. Each applicant must file an application for registration with the regional office for the region where the applicant has his or her primary place of business, and file and maintain a bond as required in §§ 201.27 through 201.34 (9 CFR 201.27 through 201.34).

      (b) If, upon review of an application, the Administrator has reason to believe the applicant is unfit to engage in the activity for which application has been made, a proceeding shall be instituted promptly affording the applicant the opportunity for a full hearing, in accordance with the Department's Rule of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings (7 CFR Subpart H), to show cause why the application for registration should not be denied. If after the hearing the application is denied, as soon as the issue(s) that formed the basis of the denial have been remedied, the applicant may file a new application for registration.

      (c) Any person regularly employed on salary, or other comparable method of compensation, by a packer to buy livestock for such packer is subject to the regulation requirements of this section. Such person must be registered as a dealer to purchase livestock for slaughter on behalf of the packer.

      (d) Every person clearing or desiring to clear the buying operations of other registrants must apply for registration as a market agency providing clearing services by filing a properly executed application on a form furnished by the Agency, and file and maintain a bond as required in §§ 201.27 through 201.34.

      (e) If an application for registration is granted, a market agency or dealer receives an acceptance letter from the Agency that issues the registration number and the effective date of the registration. Each registration issued in accordance with this section will not expire, provided that the registrant timely files its annual report with the Agency as required in section 201.97. Failure of a registrant to file an annual report by the date required in section 201.97 will result in the issuance of a default notice. Thirty days after receipt of the default notice, the registration will expire if the Agency does not receive an annual report from the registrant. A registrant who fails to renew its registration in a timely manner, and continues to operate, will be engaged in business subject to the Act without a valid registration in violation of section 303 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 203).

      (f) Registrations that expire during a period of suspension imposed as a result of an order or injunction may be renewed, but the renewal will not be effective until the specified suspension period terminates.

> [49 FR 33003, Aug. 20, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 37094, Sept. 7, 1989; 56 FR 2127, Jan. 22, 1991; 68 FR 75388, Dec. 31, 2003; 75 FR 6300, Feb. 9, 2010]

      § 201.17   Requirements for filing tariffs.

#### § § 201.17

      (a)  Each stockyard owner and market agency operating at a posted stockyard shall file with the Regional Director for the region in which they operate a signed copy of all schedules of rates and charges, supplements and amendments thereto. The schedules, supplements and amendments must be conspicuously posted for public inspection at the stockyard, and filed with the Regional Director, at least 10 days before their effective dates, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Each schedule, supplement and amendment shall set forth its effective date, a description of the stockyard services rendered, the stockyard at which it applies, the name and address of the stockyard owner or market agency, the kind of livestock covered by it, and any rules or regulations which affect any rate or charge contained therein. Each schedule of rates and charges filed shall be designated by successive numbers. Each supplement and amendment to such schedule shall be numbered and shall designate the number of the schedule which it supplements or amends.

      (b)  When the schedule in effect provides for feed charges to be based on an average cost plus a specified margin, the 10-day filing and notice provision contained in section 306(c) of the Act is waived. A schedule of the current feed charges based on average feed cost and showing the effective date shall be conspicuously posted at the stockyard at all times. Changes in feed charges may become effective 2 days after the change is posted at the stockyard.

      (c)  The 10-day filing and notice provision contained in section 306(a) of the Act is waived for a schedule of charges for professional veterinary services. A schedule of charges for professional veterinary services rendered by a veterinarian at a posted stockyard shall be conspicuously posted at the stockyard at all times. The schedule of charges and any supplement or amendment thereto may become effective 2 days after the schedule, supplement, or amendment is posted at the stockyard.

      (d)  If the same schedule is to be observed by more than one market agency operating at any one stockyard, one schedule will suffice for such market agencies. The names and business addresses of those market agencies adhering to such schedule must appear on the schedule.

> [56 FR 2128, Jan. 22, 1991, as amended at 68 FR 75388, Dec. 31, 2003; 88 FR 62696, Sept. 13, 2023]

    Subpart G—Market Agency, Dealer, and Packer Bonds

      § 201.29   Market agencies, packers and dealers required to file and maintain bonds.

#### § § 201.29

      (a) Every market agency, packer, and dealer, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and except packer buyers registered as dealers to purchase livestock for slaughter only, shall execute and maintain a reasonable bond on forms approved by the Administrator containing the appropriate condition clauses, as set forth in § 201.31 of the regulations, applicable to the activity or activities in which the person or persons propose to engage, to secure the performance of obligations incurred by such market agency, packer, or dealer. No market agency, packer, or dealer required to maintain a bond shall conduct his operations unless there is on file and in effect a bond complying with the regulations in this part.

      (b) Every market agency buying on a commission basis and every dealer buying for his own account or for the accounts of others shall file and maintain a bond. If a registrant operates as both a market agency buying on a commission basis and as a dealer, only one bond to cover both buying operations need be filed. Any person operating as a market agency selling on a commission basis and as a market agency buying on a commission basis or as a dealer shall file and maintain separate bonds to cover his selling and buying operations.

      (c) Each market agency and dealer whose buying operations are cleared by another market agency shall be named as clearee in the bond filed and maintained by the market agency registered to provide clearing services. Each market agency selling livestock on a commission basis shall file and maintain its own bond.

      (d) Every packer purchasing livestock, directly or through an affiliate or employee or a wholly-owned subsidiary, except those packers whose annual purchases do not exceed $500,000, shall file and maintain a reasonable bond. In the event a packer maintains a wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate to conduct its livestock buying, the wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate shall be registered as a packer buyer for its parent packer firm, and the required bond shall be maintained by the parent packer firm.

> [48 FR 8806, Mar. 2, 1983]

      § 201.30   Amount of market agency, dealer and packer bonds.

#### § § 201.30

      (a)  To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the dollar value of livestock sold during the preceding business year, or the substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency did business, by the actual number of days on which livestock was sold. The divisor (the number of days on which livestock was sold) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $50,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $50,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $50,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage for a market agency selling on commission be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.

      (b)  The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by the dealer or market agency during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the dealer or market agency or both did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $75,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.

      (c)  The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by all persons for whom the market agency served as a clearor during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased by all persons for whom the market agency served as a clearor during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency acting as clearing agency did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $75,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.

      (d)  The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by the packer during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the packer did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage for a packer be less than $10,000.

      (e) If a person applying for registration as a market agency or dealer has been engaged in the business of handling livestock before the date of the application, the value of the livestock handled, if representative of future operations, must be used in computing the required amount of bond coverage. If the applicant for registration is a successor in business to a registrant formerly subject to these regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the applicant must be at least that amount required of the prior registrant, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator. If a packer becomes subject to these regulations, the value of livestock purchased, if representative of future operations, must be used in computing the required amount of bond coverage. If a packer is a successor in business to a packer formerly subject to these regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the successor must be at least that amount required of the prior packer, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator.

      (f) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that a bond is inadequate to secure the performance of the obligations of the market agency, dealer or packer covered thereby, the Administrator shall notify such person to adjust the bond to meet the requirements the Administrator determines to be reasonable.

> [48 FR 8806, Mar. 2, 1983]

      § 201.31   Conditions in market agency, dealer and packer bonds.

#### § § 201.31

      Each market agency, dealer and packer bond shall contain conditions applicable to the activity or activities in which the person or persons named as principal or clearees in the bond propose to engage, which conditions shall be as follows or in terms to provide equivalent protection:

      (a)  If the said principal shall pay when due to the person or persons entitled thereto the gross amount, less lawful charges, for which all livestock is sold for the accounts of others by said principal.

      (b)  If the said principal shall pay when due to the person or persons entitled thereto the purchase price of all livestock purchased by said principal for his own account or for the accounts of others, and if the said principal shall safely keep and properly disburse all funds, if any, which come into his hands for the purpose of paying for livestock purchased for the accounts of others.

      (c)  If the said principal, acting as a clearing agency responsible for the financial obligations of other registrants engaged in buying livestock, viz: (Insert here the names of such other registrants as they appear in the application for registration), or if such other registrants, shall (1) pay when due to the person or persons entitled thereto the purchase price of all livestock purchased by such other registrants for their own account or for the accounts of others; and (2) safely keep and properly disburse all funds coming into the hands of such principal or such other registrants for the purpose of paying for livestock purchased for the accounts of others.

      (d)  If the said principal shall pay when due to the person or persons entitled thereto the purchase price of all livestock purchased by said principal for his own account.

> [47 FR 32695, July 29, 1982]

      § 201.32   Trustee in market agency, dealer and packer bonds.

#### § § 201.32

      Bonds may be in favor of a trustee who shall be a financially responsible, disinterested person satisfactory to the Administrator. State officials, secretaries or other officers of livestock exchanges or of similar trade associations, attorneys at law, banks and trust companies, or their officers, are deemed suitable trustees. If a trustee is not designated in the bond and action is taken to recover damages for breach of any condition thereof, the Administrator shall designate a person to act as trustee. In those States in which a State official is required by statute to act or has agreed to act as trustee, such official shall be designated by the Administrator as trustee when a designation by the Administrator becomes necessary.

> [41 FR 53774, Dec. 9, 1976]

      § 201.33   Persons damaged may maintain suit; filing and notification of claims; time limitations; legal expenses.

#### § § 201.33

      Each bond and each bond equivalent filed pursuant to the regulations in this part shall contain provisions that:

      (a) Any person damaged by failure of the principal to comply with any condition clause of the bond or bond equivalent may maintain suit to recover on the bond or bond equivalent even though such person is not a party named in the bond or bond equivalent;

      (b) Any claim for recovery on the bond or bond equivalent must be filed in writing with either the surety, if any, or the trustee, if any, or the Administrator, and whichever of these parties receives such a claim shall notify the other such party or parties at the earliest practical date;

      (c) The Administrator is authorized to designate a trustee pursuant to § 201.32;

      (d) The surety on the bond, or the trustee on the bond equivalent, as the case may be, shall not be liable to pay any claim if it is not filed in writing within 60 days from the date of the transaction on which the claim is based or if suit thereon is commenced less than 120 days or more than 547 days from the date of the transaction on which the claim is based;

      (e) The proceeds of the bond or bond equivalent, as the case may be, shall not be used to pay fees, salaries, or expenses for legal representation of the surety or the principal.

> [56 FR 2128, Jan. 22, 1991]

      § 201.34   Termination of market agency, dealer and packer bonds.

#### § § 201.34

      (a) Each bond shall contain a provision requiring that, prior to terminating such bond, at least 30 days notice in writing shall be given to the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, by the party terminating the bond. Such provision may state that in the event the surety named therein writes a replacement bond for the same principal, the 30-day notice requirement may be waived and the bond will be terminated as of the effective date of the replacement bond.

      (b) Each bond filed by a market agency who clears other registrants who are named in the bond shall contain a provision requiring that, prior to terminating the bond coverage of any clearee named therein, at least 30 days notice in writing shall be given to the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, by the surety.

      (b)  Every market agency engaged in selling livestock on a commission or agency basis shall establish and maintain a separate bank account designated as “Custodial Account for Shippers' Proceeds,” or some similar identifying designation, to disclose that the depositor is acting as a fiduciary and that the funds in the account are trust funds.

      (c)  The market agency shall deposit in its custodial account before the close of the next business day (the next day on which banks are customarily open for business whether or not the market agency does business on that day) after livestock is sold (1) the proceeds from the sale of livestock that have been collected, and (2) an amount equal to the proceeds receivable from the sale of livestock that are due from (i) the market agency, (ii) any owner, officer, or employee of the market agency, and (iii) any buyer to whom the market agency has extended credit. The market agency shall thereafter deposit in the custodial account all proceeds collected until the account has been reimbursed in full, and shall, before the close of the seventh day following the sale of livestock, deposit an amount equal to all the remaining proceeds receivable whether or not the proceeds have been collected by the market agency.

      (d)  The custodial account for shippers' proceeds shall be drawn on only for payment of (1) the net proceeds to the consignor or shipper, or to any person that the market agency knows is entitled to payment, (2) to pay lawful charges against the consignment of livestock which the market agency shall, in its capacity as agent, be required to pay, and (3) to obtain any sums due the market agency as compensation for its services.

      (e)  Each market agency shall keep such accounts and records as will disclose at all times the handling of funds in such custodial accounts for shippers' proceeds. Accounts and records must at all times disclose the name of the consignors and the amount due and payable to each from funds in the custodial account for shippers' proceeds.

      (f)  Such custodial accounts for shippers' proceeds must be established and maintained in banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      (g)  Funds in a custodial account for shippers' proceeds may be maintained in an interest-bearing savings account and/or invested in one or more certificates of deposit, to the extent that such deposit or investment does not impair the ability of the market agency to meet its obligations to its consignors. The savings account must be properly designated as a part of the custodial account of the market agency in its fiduciary capacity as trustee of the custodial funds and maintained in the same bank as the custodial account. The certificates of deposit, as property of the custodial account, must be issued by the bank in which the custodial account is kept and must be made payable to the market agency in its fiduciary capacity as trustee of the custodial funds.

      (2) The name and address of the livestock producer or poultry grower, or a designation by which they may be readily identified;

      (3) The name, initials or identification number of the person who weighed the feed, or if required by State law, the signature of the weigher;

      (4) The city and state in which the scale is located, and, if a facility has more than one scale on which feed is weighed, the identity of the scale;

      (6) The date and time zero balance was determined;

      (7) The gross weight, tare weight, and net weight of each lot assigned to an individual producer or grower, if applicable;

      (a)  (1) The empty scale shall be balanced each day before weighing begins, and maintained in correct balance which weighing operations continue. The zero balance shall be verified at intervals of not more than 15 drafts or 15 minutes, whichever is completed first. In addition, the zero balance of the scale shall be verified whenever a weigher resumes weighing duties after an absence from the scale and also whenever a load exceeding half the scale capacity or 10,000 pounds (whichever is less) has been weighed and is followed by a load of less than 1,000 pounds, verification to occur before the weighing of the load of less than 1,000 pounds.

      (2) The time at which the empty scale is balanced or its zero balance verified shall be recorded on scale tickets or other permanent records. Balance tickets must be filed with other scale tickets issued on that date.

      (3) Before balancing the empty scale, the weigher shall assure himself that the scale gates are closed and that no persons or animals are on the scale platform or in contact with the stock rack, gates, or platform. If the scale is balanced with persons on the scale platform, the zero balance shall be verified whenever there is a change in such persons. When the scale is properly balanced and ready for weighing, the weigher shall so indicate by an appropriate signal.

      (4) Weighbeam scales shall be balanced by first seating each poise securely in its zero notch and then moving the balance ball to such position that a correct zero balance is obtained. A scale equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced when the pointer comes to rest at zero. A scale not equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced if the weighbeam, when released at the top or bottom of the trig loop, swings freely in the trig loop in such manner that it will come to rest at the center of the trig loop.

      (5) Dial scales shall be balanced by releasing all drop weights and operating the balance ball or other balancing device to obtain a correct zero balance. The indicator must visually indicate zero on the dial and the ticket printer must record a correct zero balance.

      (6) Electronic digital scales should be properly warmed up before use. In most cases, it is advisable to leave the electric power on continuously. The zero load balance shall be verified by recording the zero balance on a scale ticket. The main indicating element and the remote visual weight display shall indicate zero when the balance is verified. The proper procedure for balancing this type of scale will vary according to the manufacturer. Refer to the operator's manual for specific instructions.

      (b)  (1) Before weighing a draft of livestock, the weigher shall assure himself that the entire draft is on the scale platform with the gates closed and that no persons or animals off the scale are in contact with the platform, gates, or stock rack.

      (i) On a weighbeam scale with a balance indicator, the weight of a draft shall be determined by seating the poises at such positions that the pointer will come to rest within the central target area or within   (0.25) inch of the zero mark.

      (ii) On a weighbeam scale without a balance indicator, the weight shall be determined by seating the poises at such positions that the weighbeam, when released from the top or bottom of the trig loop, will swing freely and come to rest at the approximate center of the trig loop.

      (iii) On a dial scale, the weight is indicated automatically when the indicator moves around the dial face and comes to rest.

      (iv) On an electronic digital scale, the weight of a draft is indicated automatically when the weight value indicated stabilized.

      (2) The correct weight of a livestock draft is the value in pounds indicated when a correct load balance is obtained. The weigher should always concentrate his attention upon the beam tip, balance indicator or dial indicator while weighing and not concern himself with reading the visible weight indications until correct load balance is obtained. On electronic digital scales, the weigher should concentrate on the pulsing or flickering of weight values to assure that the unit indicates a stable weight before activating the print button.

      (c)  (1) The weight of each draft shall be recorded immediately after the load balance is obtained and before any poises are moved or the load is removed from the scale platform. The weigher shall make certain that the printed weight record agrees with the weight value visually indicated when correct load balance is obtained. He shall also assure himself that the printed weight value is distinct and legible.

      (2) The weight printing device on a scale shall be operated only to produce a printed or impressed record of the weight value while the livestock load is on the scale and correctly balanced. If the weight value is not printed clearly and correctly, the ticket shall be marked void and a new one printed before the livestock is removed from the scale.

      (d)  (1) Scale tickets used to record the weight values of livestock in purchase or sales transactions shall be used, at any given scale, in the order of their consecutive serial numbers unless otherwise marked to show the order of their use. All tickets shall show the date of the weighing and the name or initials of the weigher performing the weighing service.

      (2) No scale tickets shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of because they are soiled, damaged, incorrectly executed, or voided. They shall be preserved and filed to comprise a complete serial number sequence.

      (3) No scale ticket shall be used to record the weight of a livestock draft for “catch-weight,” inventory, transportation charge or other nonsale purposes unless the ticket is clearly marked to show why the weight was determined.

      (4) When weight values are recorded by means of automatic recording equipment directly on the accounts of sale or other basic records, such record may serve in lieu of a scale ticket.

      (e)  (1) The primary responsibility of a weigher is to determine and accurately record the weight of livestock drafts without prejudice or favor to any person or agency and without regard for livestock ownership, price, condition, fill, shrink, or other considerations. A weigher shall not permit the representations or attitudes of any persons or agencies to influence his judgment or action in performing his duties.

      (2) Unused scale tickets, or those which are partially executed but without a printed weight value, shall not be left exposed or accessible to unauthorized personnel. All such tickets shall be kept under lock when the weigher is not at his duty station.

      (3) Accurate weighing and correct weight recording require that a weigher shall not permit his operations to be hurried to the extent that inaccurate weights or incorrect weight records may result. Each draft of livestock must be weighed accurately to the nearest minimum weight value that can be indicated or recorded. Manual operations connected with balancing, weighing, and recording shall be performed with the care necessary to prevent damage to the accurately machined and adjusted parts of weighbeams, poises, and printing devices.

      (4) Livestock owners, buyers, or others having legitimate interest in a livestock draft must be permitted to observe the balancing, weighing, and recording procedures, and a weigher shall not deny them that right or withhold from them any information pertaining to the weight of that draft. He shall check the zero balance of the scale or reweigh a draft of livestock when requested by such parties.

      (f)  (1) A scale must be sensitive in response to platform loading if it is to yield accurate weights. It, therefore, is the duty of a weigher to assure himself that interferences, weighbeam friction, or other factors do not impair sensitivity. He should satisfy himself, at least twice each day, that the scale is sufficiently sensitive, and if the following requirements are not met, he should report the facts to his superior or employer immediately.

      (2) A weighbeam scale with a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the pointer at the center of the target, movement of the fractional poise one graduation will change the indicator rest point   inch (0.25) or the width of the central target area, whichever is greater.

      (3) A weighbeam scale without a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the weighbeam at the center of the trig loop, movement of the fractional poise two graduations will cause the weighbeam to come to rest at the bottom of the trig loop.

      (4) Adjustable damping devices are incorporated in balance indicators and in dial scales to absorb the effects of load impact and assist in bringing the indicator to rest. The weigher should be familiar with the location and adjustment of these damping devices and should keep them adjusted so that the pointer will oscillate freely through at least one complete cycle of movement before coming to rest at its original position.

      (5) Friction at weighbeam bearings may reduce the sensitivity of the scale, cause sluggish weighbeam action and affect weighing accuracy. A weigher should inspect the weighbeam assembly daily to make certain that there is clearance between the weighbeam and the pivot bearings.

      (6) Interferences or binding of the scale platform, stock rack, gates or other “live” parts of the scale are common causes of weighing inaccuracy. A weigher should satisfy himself, at the beginning of each weighing period, that all such “live” parts have sufficient clearance to prevent interferences.

      (g)  (1) The poises of weighbeam scales are carefully adjusted and sealed to a definite weight at the factory and any change in that weight seriously affects weighing accuracy. A weigher, therefore, should be certain that poise parts do not become broken, loose or lost and that no material is added to a poise. Balancing or weighing shall not be performed while a scale ticket is in the slot of a weighbeam poise.

      (2) Stops are provided on scale weighbeams to prevent movement of poises back of the zero graduation when balancing or weighing. When the stops become worn or broken and allow a poise to be set behind the zero position, this condition should be reported and corrected without delay.

      (3) Foreign objects or loose material in the form of nuts, bolts, washers or other material on any part of the weighbeam assembly, including the counter-balance hanger or counter-balance weights, are potential sources of weighing error. Loose balancing material must be enclosed in the shot cup of the counter-balance hanger, and counter-balance weights must not be of the slotted type which can readily be removed.

      (4) Whenever for any reason a weigher has reason to believe that a scale is not functioning properly or not yielding correct weight values, he shall discontinue weighing, report the facts to the parties responsible for scale maintenance, and request inspection, test, or repair of the scale.

      (5) When a scale has been adjusted, modified, or repaired in any manner which may affect the accuracy of weighing or weight recording, the weigher shall not use the scale until it has been tested and inspected and found to be accurate.

      (6) Count-off men, gate men, or others assigned to open or close scale gates or to drive livestock on or off the scale, shall perform those functions as directed by the weigher's signals or spoken instructions. They shall prevent persons or animals off the scale from being in contact with any part of the scale platform, stock rack, or gates while the scale is being balanced or used for weighing. They shall not open gates or remove livestock from the scale until directed by the weigher.

#### § § 201.82

      (a) Each stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, swine contractor and live poultry dealer must exercise reasonable care and promptness with respect to loading, transporting, holding, yarding, feeding, watering, weighing, or otherwise handling livestock, or live poultry to prevent waste of feed, shrinkage, injury, death or other avoidable loss.

      (b) Whenever live poultry is obtained under a poultry growing arrangement and the weight of the live poultry is a factor in calculating payment to the grower, the poultry must be transported promptly after loading. The process of obtaining the gross weight must commence immediately upon arrival at the processing plant, holding yard, or other scale normally used for such purpose. The process of obtaining the gross weight which may include, but is not limited to, fueling, uncoupling the trailer, changing the road tractor to a yard tractor or weighing the trailer only, must be conducted without delay;  the time period between arrival and completion of the process of obtaining the gross weight must not exceed thirty (30) minutes.

      (c) Live poultry dealers must not place poultry from multiple growers on a single live poultry transport trailer or other live poultry transport equipment, creating what is commonly referred to as a “split load.”

#### § § 201.106

      § 201.108-1   Instructions for weighing live poultry or feed.

#### § § 201.108-1

      Live poultry dealers who operate scales on which live poultry or feed is weighed for purposes of purchase, sale, acquisition, or settlement are responsible for the accurate weighing of such poultry or feed. They shall supply copies of the instructions in this section to all persons who perform weighing operations for them and direct such persons to familiarize themselves with the instructions and to comply with them at all times. This section shall also apply to any additional weighers who are employed at any time. Weighers must acknowledge their receipt of these instructions and agree to comply with them by signing in duplicate, a form provided by the Packers and Stockyards Division, Agricultural Marketing Service. One copy of this form is to be filed with a regional office of the Packers and Stockyards Division, Agricultural Marketing Service and the other copy retained by the Agency employing the weighers. The following instructions shall be applicable to the weighing of live poultry on all scales, except that paragraph (c)(1) of this section is only applicable to the weighing of live poultry on vehicle scales.

      (a)  (1) The scale must be maintained in zero balance at all times. The empty scale must be balanced each day before weighing begins and thereafter the scale must be balanced; and the zero balance, the time and date the empty scale was balanced must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other basic transaction record before any poultry or feed is weighed. In addition, the zero balance of the scale must be verified whenever a weigher resumes weighing duties after an absence from the scale.

      (2) Before balancing the empty scale, the weigher shall notify parties outside the scale house of his/her intention and shall be assured that no persons or vehicles are in contact with the platform. When the empty scale is balanced and ready for weighing, the weigher shall so indicate by appropriate signal.

      (3) Weighbeam scales shall be balanced by first seating each poise securely in its zero notch and then moving the balance ball to such position that a correct zero balance is obtained. A scale equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced when the indicator comes to rest in the center of the target area. A scale not equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced if the weighbeam, when released at the top or bottom of the trig loop, swings freely in the trig loop in such manner that it will come to rest at the center of the trig loop.

      (4) Dial scales shall be balanced by releasing all drop weights and operating the balance ball or other balancing device to obtain a correct zero balance. The indicator must visibly indicate zero on the dial reading face and the ticket printer must record a correct zero balance. “Balance tickets” shall be filed with other scale tickets issued on that date.

      (5) Electronic digital scales should be properly warmed up before use. In most cases it is advisable to leave the electric power on continuously. The zero balance shall be verified by recording the zero balance on a scale ticket. The main indicating element and the remote visual weight display shall indicate zero when the balance is verified. The proper procedure for balancing this type of scale will vary according to the manufacturer. Refer to the operator's manual for specific instructions.

      (6) A balance ball or other balancing device shall be operated only when balancing the empty scale and shall not be operated at any time or for any other purpose.

      (b)  (1) A scale must be sensitive in response to platform loading if it is to yield accurate weights. It, therefore, is the duty of a weigher to assure himself that interferences, weighbeam friction, or other factors do not impair sensitivity. He shall satisfy himself, at least twice each day, that the scale is sufficiently sensitive, and, if the following requirements are not met, he must report the facts to his superior or employer immediately.

      (2) A weighbeam scale with a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the indicator at the center of the target, movement of the fractional poise one graduation will change the indicator rest point ( ) inch (0.25) or the width of the central target area, whichever is greater.

      (3) A weighbeam scale without a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the weighbeam at the center of the trig loop, movement of the fractional poise two graduations will cause the weighbeam to come to rest at the bottom of the trig loop.

      (4) Adjustable damping devices are incorporated in balance indicators and in dial scales to absorb the effects of load impact and to bring the indicator to rest. The weigher must be familiar with the location and adjustment of these damping devices and keep them so adjusted that when the indicator is displaced from a position of rest, it will oscillate freely through at least one complete cycle of movement before coming to rest at its original position.

      (5) Friction at weighbeam bearings may reduce the sensitiveness of the scale, cause sluggish weighbeam action and affect weighing accuracy. A weigher must inspect the weighbeam assembly daily to make certain that there is clearance between the weighbeam and the pivot bearings.

      (6) Interferences or binding of the scale platform, or other “live” parts of the scale, are common causes of weighing inaccuracy. A weigher shall satisfy himself, at the beginning of each weighing period, that all such “live” parts have sufficient clearance to prevent interference.

      (c)  (1) Vehicle scales used to weigh live poultry shall be of sufficient length and capacity to weigh an entire vehicle as a unit; provided, that a trailer may be uncoupled from a tractor and weighed as a single unit. Before weighing a vehicle, either coupled or uncoupled, the weigher shall be assured that the entire vehicle is on the scale platform and that no persons are on the scale platform.

      (i) On a weighbeam scale with a balance indicator the weight of a vehicle shall be determined by moving the poises to such positions that the indicator will come to rest within the central target area.

      (ii) On a weighbeam scale without a balance indicator the weight shall be determined by moving the poises to such positions that the weighbeam, when released from the top or bottom of the trig loop, will swing freely in the trig loop and come to rest at the approximate center of the trig loop.

      (iii) On a dial scale the weight of a vehicle is indicated automatically when the indicator revolves around the dial face and comes to rest.

      (iv) On an electronic digital scale the weight of a vehicle is indicated automatically when the weight value indicated is stable.

      (v) A feed hopper attached to an electronic digital scale must be empty of feed and the electronic digital scale must be balanced at zero prior to first weighment for each grower or per truckload, whichever is applicable. The date and time that the empty hopper scale is balanced with proof of the zero balance must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other permanent record that must be attached to the grower's copy of the scale ticket.

      (vi) An onboard weighing system must be level and locked in position and zero balanced prior to weighing. The date and time the onboard scale is balanced with proof of the zero balance must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other permanent record that must be attached to the grower's copy of the scale ticket. When more than one grower's feed is weighed, the preceding grower's gross weight can be used for the next grower's tare weight, and can be repeated until the unit is full.

      (2) The correct weight is the value in pounds indicated by a weighbeam, dial or digital scale when a stable load balance is obtained. In any case, the weigher should concentrate on the beam tip, balance indicator, dial or digital indicator while weighing and not be concerned with reading the visible weight indications until a stable load balance is obtained. On electronic digital scales, the weigher should concentrate on the pulsing or flickering of weight values to assure that the unit indicates a stable weight before activating the print button.

      (d)  (1) The gross or tare weight shall be recorded immediately after the load balance is obtained and before any poises are moved or load removed from the scale platform. The weigher shall make certain that the printed weight record agrees with the weight value visibly indicated on the weighbeam, dial or digital indicator when correct load balance is obtained. The weigher shall also assure that the printed weight value is sufficiently distinct and legible.

      (2) The weight printing device on a scale shall be operated only to produce a printed or impressed record of the weight while the load is on the scale and correctly balanced. If the weight is not printed clearly and correctly, the ticket shall be marked void and a new one printed before the load is removed from the scale.

      (3) When returned feed from a contract poultry grower is picked up and weighed on an onboard weighing system, the weight of the feed must be recorded and a ticket printed. That weight must be used as the tare weight when feed from another contract poultry grower is picked up on the same load. The procedure must be followed each time another grower's feed is added to the load.

      (e)  (1) The primary responsibility of a weigher is to determine and record the true weight of live poultry without prejudice or favor to any person or agency and without regard for poultry ownership, price, condition, shrink, or other considerations. A weigher shall not permit the representations or attitudes of any persons or agencies to influence their judgment or action in performing his/her duties.

      (2) Accurate weighing and weight recording require that a weigher shall not permit operations to be hurried to the extent that inaccurate weights or incorrect weight records may result. The gross, tare and net weights must be determined accurately to the nearest minimum graduation. Manual operations connected with balancing, weighing, and recording shall be performed with the care necessary to prevent damage to the accurately machined and adjusted parts of weighbeams, poises, and printing devices. Rough handling of these parts shall be avoided.

      (3) Poultry growers, live poultry dealers, sellers, or others having legitimate interest in a load of poultry are entitled to observe the balancing, weighing, and recording procedures. A weigher shall not deny such persons that right or withhold from them any information pertaining to the weight. The weigher shall check the zero balance of the scale or reweigh a load of poultry when requested by such parties or duly authorized representatives of the administrator.

      (f)  (1) The poises of weighbeam scales are carefully adjusted and sealed to a definite weight at the factory and any change in that weight seriously affects weighing accuracy. A weigher, therefore, shall observe if poise parts are broken, loose or lost or if material is added to a poise and shall report any such condition to his/her superior or employer. Balancing or weighing shall not be performed while a scale ticket is in the slot of a weighbeam poise.

      (2) Stops are provided on scale weighbeams to prevent movement of poises back of the zero graduation when balancing or weighing. When the stops become worn or broken and allow a poise to be set behind the zero position, this condition must be reported by the weigher to their superior or employer and corrected without delay.

      (3) Motion detection circuits are a part of electronic scales. They are designed to prevent the printing of weight values if the load has not stabilized within prescribed limits. The weighmaster's duty is to print the actual weight of the load within these limits. This requires printing the actual weight of the load, not one of the other weights that may be within the motion detection limits.

      (4) Foreign objects or loose material in the form of nuts, bolts, washers, or other material on any part of the weighbeam assembly, including the counter-balance hanger or counter-balance weights, are potential sources of weighing error. Loose balancing material must be enclosed in the shot cup of the counter-balance hanger and counter-balance weights must not be of the slotted type which can readily be removed.

      (5) Whenever, for any reason, a weigher has reason to believe that a scale is not functioning properly or not yielding correct weight values, the weigher shall discontinue weighing, report the facts to the parties responsible for scale maintenance and request inspection, test or repair of the scale.

      (6) When a scale has been adjusted, modified, or repaired in any manner which can affect the accuracy of weighing or weight recording, the weigher shall not use the scale until it has been tested and inspected and found to be accurate.

      § 202.103   Rule 3: Beginning a reparation proceeding.

#### § § 202.103

      (a)  A reparation proceeding is begun by filing a complaint.

      (b)  The complaint must be in writing, state the facts of the matter complained of, identify each person complained against (respondent), and identify each person who complains against such respondent and claims reparation from such respondent. It may be on a printed form supplied by the Agency, or may be a formal document, or may be a letter, mailgram, or telegram. It may be typewritten or handwritten. If it is not on a printed form supplied by the Agency, the Agency Head may, prior to docketing of the proceeding, recommend to the complainant that an amended complaint be filed on such a printed form.

      (c)  So far as practicable, the complaint should include the following items as applicable:

      (1) Date and place where the alleged violation occurred;

      (2) Quantity and quality of the livestock involved;

      (3) Whether a sale is involved and, if so, the date, sale price, and amount actually paid and received;

If it appears that any such item has been omitted from the complaint, the Agency Head may, prior to docketing of the proceeding, recommend to the complainant that such item be supplied by written amendment to the complaint.

      (d)  The complaint should be transmitted or delivered to any regional office of the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD), or to the PSD headquarters in Washington, DC, or delivered to any full time PSD employee.

      (e)  The complaint must be received by the Department within 90 days after accrual of the cause of action alleged in it. If a complaint is transmitted or delivered to an office of the Department, it shall be deemed to be received by the Department when it reaches such office. If a complaint is delivered to a full-time PSD employee, it shall be deemed to be received by the Department when it is received by such employee.

      (f)  The complaint may be amended at any time prior to the close of an oral hearing or the filing of the last evidence in a written hearing, except that:

      (1) An amendment cannot add a respondent if it is filed more than 90 days after accrual of the cause of action against such respondent;

      (2) An amendment cannot state a new and different cause of action if it is filed more than 90 days after accrual of such new and different cause of action; and

      (3) After the first amendment, or after the filing of an answer by the respondent, an amendment may not be filed without the written consent of the respondent, or leave of the presiding officer, or, prior to docketing of the proceeding, leave of the Agency Head. Any such amendment must be filed in writing and signed by the complainant or the attorney or representative of the complainant. If any such amendment is filed before the initial service of the complaint on the respondent, it shall be served on the respondent only if the complaint is served as provided in Rule 4(b), § 202.104(b). If any such amendment is filed after such service, it shall be served on the respondent in any case.

      (g)  At any time, a complainant may withdraw a complaint filed by or on behalf of the same complainant, thus terminating the reparation proceeding on such complaint unless a counterclaim or another complaint is pending therein. If a complainant fails to cooperate with the Secretary in the disposition of the matter complained of, such complainant may be presumed to desire to withdraw the complaint filed by or on behalf of such complainant, after service on the parties of written notice of the facts of such failure and reasonable opportunity for such complainant to state whether such presumption is correct.

If the statements in the complaint, and information obtained in the investigation, seem to warrant such action, the Agency Head may make an effort to obtain the consent of the parties to an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter by communication with the parties or their attorneys or representatives. Such communication may be written or oral or both.

      (b)  If the matter is not disposed of as provided in paragraph (a), the complaint, together with any amendment which has been filed, shall be served on the respondent with a notice that an answer is required.

      (c)  A report prepared by the Agency, of its investigation of the matter complained of, and supplements to such a report, may be served on the parties and made a part of the record of the proceeding. Whether such a report or supplement shall be prepared, and whether it shall be served on the parties and made a part of the record, and its contents, shall be in the discretion of the Agency Head. The Judicial Officer shall consider information in such a report or supplement as part of the evidence in the proceeding, to the extent that such information is relevant and material to the proceeding. Any party may submit evidence in rebuttal of such information as is provided generally in these rules for the submission of evidence. Oral testimony, to the extent credible, shall be given greater weight as evidence than such information.

      § 202.106   Rule 6: Answer.

#### § § 202.106

      (a)  Within 20 days after service on a respondent, of a complaint or amendment of a complaint, such person shall file an answer in writing, signed by such person or by the attorney or representative of such person. If a respondent desires an oral hearing, a request for it should be included with the answer of such person. If any answer or amended answer is filed, it shall be served on the complainant.

      (b)  If a respondent desires to make a defense, the answer of such person shall contain a precise statement of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense, and shall specifically admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations of the complaint, except that, if the respondent is without knowledge, such answer shall state that. If a respondent does not desire to make a defense, the answer of such person shall contain an admission of all the allegations of the complaint, or an admission of liability to the complainant in the full amount claimed by the complainant as reparation, or both. An answer may be stricken for failure to comply with these requirements; notice of an order so striking an answer shall be served on the parties; within 20 days after service on a respondent of such a notice, such person shall file an answer which complies with these requirements.

      (c)  The answer may assert a setoff, counterclaim, or cross-claim, or any combination thereof. No counterclaim or cross-claim shall be considered unless it is based on a violation for which the act authorizes reparation to be ordered to be paid, and filed within 90 days after accrual of the cause of action alleged therein:  That a counterclaim not filed within such time limit may be considered if based on a transaction complained of in the complaint. Any cross-claim asserted against a co-respondent, based on a violation for which the act authorizes reparation to be ordered to be paid, and filed within 90 days after accrual of the cause of action alleged therein, shall be served on such person as a complaint; within 20 days after such service, such person shall file an answer thereto in compliance with the above requirements for an answer to a complaint.

      (d)  If a respondent fails to file an answer as required above, such persons shall be deemed to have admitted all the allegations of the complaint or cross-claim against such person, and to have consented to the issuance of a final order in the proceeding, based on all evidence in the record. For this purpose, the evidence in the record may include information contained in a report of investigation made a part of the record pursuant to rule 4(c), § 202.104(c), and evidence received in a hearing, oral or written, held subsequent to the expiration of the time for filing such answer, but shall not be limited to such information and evidence. Such a respondent shall not be entitled to service provided in these rules, of any notice or document except the final order in the proceeding.

      § 202.107   Rule 7: Reply.

#### § § 202.107

      (a)  If the answer asserts a counterclaim or a setoff, the complainant may file a reply in writing within 20 days after service of the answer on such person. If any reply or amended reply is filed, it shall be served on the respondent.

      (b)  The reply shall be confined strictly to the matters alleged in the counterclaim or setoff asserted in the answer. It shall contain a precise statement of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense to the counterclaim or setoff and shall specifically admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations of the answer constituting such counterclaim or setoff, except that, if the complainant is without knowledge, the reply shall state that.

      (c)  If no reply is filed, the allegations of the answer shall be regarded as denied.

      § 202.108   Rule 8: Docketing of proceeding.

#### § § 202.108

      Promptly following receipt of the answer, or the reply (if the answer asserts a counterclaim or a setoff), or following the expiration of the period of time prescribed above for the filing of the answer or of the reply, the agency head shall transmit all of the papers which have been filed in the proceeding (including the investigation report if any has been served on the parties) to the hearing clerk, who shall assign a docket number to the proceeding. Thereafter the proceeding shall be referred to by such number. The hearing clerk shall promptly transmit all such papers to the Office of the General Counsel for assignment of a presiding officer.

      § 202.109   Rule 9: Depositions.

#### § § 202.109

      (a)  Any party may file an application for an order for the taking of testimony by deposition, at any time after docketing of a proceeding and before the close of an oral hearing or the filing of such party's evidence in a written hearing therein. The application shall set forth: (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and address of the person (referred to in this section as the “officer”) before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the reasons why such deposition should be taken, which must show that it may be able to be used as set forth in paragraph (i) of this section; (4) whether the proposed examination is to be on interrogatories or oral; and (5) if oral, a suggested time and place where the proposed deposition is to be made and a suggested manner in which the proposed deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or by personal attendance of the individuals who are expected to participate in the deposition). The application for an order for the taking of testimony by deposition shall be made in writing, unless it is made orally on the record at an oral hearing.

      (b)  If any such application is made orally on the record at an oral hearing, each party other than the applicant, present at such hearing, may respond to it orally. If any such application is in writing it shall be served on each party other than the applicant, and each such other party shall have not less than 20 days, from the date of service on such party of the application, to file a written response to it.

      (c)  (1) If the examination will be oral, parties who will not be present or represented at it may file written questions with the officer prior to the time of the examination.

      (2) The presiding officer may direct, or the parties may agree, that the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions. If the presiding officer finds, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such party has a principal place of business or residence more than 100 miles from the place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue hardship on such party to be present or represented at an oral examination at such place, the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions. In any such case, the presiding officer shall state on the record at the oral hearing that, or shall serve the parties with notice that, the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions.

      (3) If the examination is conducted by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.

      (d)  (1) The presiding officer, if satisfied that good cause for taking the deposition is present, may order the taking of the deposition.

      (2) The order shall be served on the parties and shall include:

      (i) The name and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be made;

      (ii) The name of the deponent;

      (iii) Whether the deposition will be oral or on written questions;

      (iv) If the deposition is oral, the manner in which the deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition); and

      (v) The time, which shall not be less than 20 days after the issuance of the order, and place.

      (3) The officer, time, place, and manner of the deposition as stated in the presiding officer's order need not be the same as the officer, time, place, and manner suggested in the application.

      (4) The deposition shall be conducted in the manner (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition) agreed to by the parties.

      (5) If the parties cannot agree on the manner in which the deposition is to be conducted:

      (i) The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by audio-visual telecommunication:

      (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

      (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or

      (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.

      (ii) If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the deposition:

      (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

      (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or

      (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or audio-visual telecommunication.

      (e)  No deposition shall be made except before an officer authorized by the law of the United States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths, or before the presiding officer. No deposition shall be made before an officer who is a relative (within the third degree by blood or marriage), employee, attorney, or representative of any party (or an employee of an attorney or representative of any party), or who is financially interested in the result of the proceeding.

      (f)  The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation, and the testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the officer, or by some person under the direction and in the presence of the officer. If the examination is on interrogatories, they shall be propounded by the officer. If the examination is oral, the deponent shall be examined first by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken, or the representative of such party, and shall be subject to cross-examination by any other party or the representative thereof who is present at the examination; the officer shall propound any interrogatories filed with the officer by parties not present or represented at the examination.

      (g)  The officer shall certify on the transcript or recording that the deponent was duly sworn by the officer and that the transcript or recording is a true record of the deponent's testimony, with such exceptions as the certificate shall specify. The officer shall then securely seal the transcript or recording, together with three copies of the transcript or recording, with an extra copy for each party in excess of two, in an envelope, and mail the same by registered or certified mail to the presiding officer.

      (h)  After the transcript or recording is received by the presiding officer, it shall promptly be served on all parties. Any party, within 20 days after such service, may file a written motion proposing corrections to the transcript or recording. Any such motion shall be served on each party other than the one filing it, who shall have 10 days to file a written response to it. Any such response shall be served on each party other than the one filing it. Such documents, if filed, shall be a part of the record of the proceeding if any portion of the transcript or recording is made a part of the record. All portions of the transcript or recording which are not referred to in any such motion shall be presumed to be accurate except for obvious typographical errors.

      (i)  If a written hearing is held, a transcript or recording, of a deposition ordered and taken in accord with this section, may be made a part of the record as evidence by any party, by written motion filed with such party's evidence. If an oral hearing is held, except as otherwise provided in these rules, such a transcript or recording may be made a part of the record as evidence, on written motion filed by any party, or oral motion of any party made at the oral hearing, if no party objects after reasonable notice and opportunity to do so, or if the presiding officer finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and:

      (1) That the witness is dead;

      (2) That the witness is unable to attend or testify for any good reason including age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;

      (3) That the party offering the transcript or recording has tried without success to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or

      (4) That such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony orally before the presiding officer, to allow the transcript or recording to be used.

      (j)  Fees and reimbursements payable to an officer taking a deposition, or other person recording the testimony in the deposition, shall be paid by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.

      (k)  No subpoena can issue, to compel attendance, testimony, or production of documentary evidence, at an examination under this rule 9.

      (l)  In any case, any transcript or recording of any deposition, or any part of such a transcript or recording, may be made a part of the record as evidence by agreement of the parties other than a party failing to file an answer as required in these rules.

      § 202.110   Rule 10: Prehearing conference.

#### § § 202.110

      (a) The presiding officer, at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing, may request the parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before the presiding officer to consider:

      (1) The simplification of issues;

      (2) The necessity of amendments to pleadings;

      (3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;

      (4) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;

      (5) The negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;

      (6) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;

      (7) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be requested;

      (8) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; or

      (9) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.

      (b)  (1) The prehearing conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the prehearing conference by audio-visual telecommunication:

      (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

      (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the prehearing conference; or

      (iii) Would cost less than conducting the prehearing conference by telephone or correspondence. If the presiding officer determines that a prehearing conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the prehearing conference, the prehearing conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the prehearing conference, by telephone, or by correspondence.

      (2) If the prehearing conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the prehearing conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the prehearing conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the prehearing conference:

      (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

      (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the prehearing conference; or

      (iii) Would cost less than conducting the prehearing conference by audio-visual telecommunication.

      § 202.111   Rule 11: Hearing, oral or written.

#### § § 202.111

      (a)  A hearing, oral or written, shall be held unless:

      (1) Each respondent admits or is deemed to admit sufficient allegations of the complaint to support the full amount claimed by the complainant as reparation;

      (2) Each respondent admits liability to the complainant in the full amount claimed by the complainant as reparation;

      (3) Before a hearing has been completed the parties agree in writing that the proceeding may be decided on the basis of the record as it stands at the time such agreement is filed; or

      (4) Before a hearing has been completed the parties settle their dispute or the complainant withdraws the complaint.

      (b)  The hearing provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be oral if:

      (1) $10,000 or more is in controversy and any respondent files a written request for an oral hearing with such respondent's answer; or

      (2) $10,000 or more is in controversy and any complainant files a written request for an oral hearing on or before the 20th day after service on such complainant of notice that no respondent has filed a timely request for an oral hearing; or

      (3) Less than $10,000 is in controversy and the presiding officer determines, upon written request by any party thereto, that an oral hearing is necessary to establish the facts and circumstances giving rise to the controversy. The hearing shall be written if not oral.

      (c)  If $10,000 or more is in controversy and a party has timely filed a request for oral hearing, such party may withdraw such request at any time prior to completion of an oral hearing. If such a withdrawal leaves no pending request for oral hearing in the proceeding, and if the presiding officer has not decided that the hearing should be oral, each other party shall be served with notice of this and shall be given 20 days to request an oral hearing. If any party files a request for oral hearing in such time, the hearing shall be oral in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d)  The presiding officer may recommend voluntary withdrawal of a request for oral hearing, timely filed. Declining to make such withdrawal shall not affect the rights or interests of any party.

      (e)  Any party may appear in an oral hearing, or file evidence in a written hearing, in person or by counsel or other representative. For unethical or contumacious conduct in or in connection with a proceeding, the presiding officer may preclude a person from further acting as attorney or representative for any party to the proceeding; any such order of the presiding officer shall be served on the parties; an appeal to the Judicial Officer may be taken from any such order immediately.

      § 202.112   Rule 12: Oral hearing.

#### § § 202.112

      (a)  (1) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage where an oral hearing is to be held, the presiding officer shall set a time, place, and manner for oral hearing. The time shall be set based upon careful consideration to the convenience of the parties. The place shall be set in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and careful consideration to the convenience of the parties. The manner in which the hearing is to be conducted shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section.

      (2) The place shall be set in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act, if applicable. In essence, under paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act, if the complainant and the respondent, or all of the parties, if there are more than two, have their principal places of business or residence within a single unit of local government, a single geographical area within a State, or a single State, the oral hearing is to be held as near as possible to such places of business or residence, depending on the availability of an appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If the parties have such places of business or residence distant from each other, then paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act are not applicable.

      (3) The oral hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the oral hearing by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing:

      (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

      (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or

      (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the presiding officer determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.

      (4) The presiding officer may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if the presiding officer finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:

      (i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;

      (ii) Would not prejudice any party; and

      (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.

      (b)  (1) A notice stating the time, place, and manner of oral hearing shall be served on each party prior to the time of the oral hearing. The notice shall state whether the oral hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing. If any change is made in the time, place, or manner of the oral hearing, a notice of the change shall be served on each party prior to the time of the oral hearing as changed, unless the change is made during the course of an oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording. Any party may waive such notice, in writing, or orally on the record at an oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording.

      (2) If the presiding officer orders an oral hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.

      (3) Within 10 days after the presiding officer issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the presiding officer reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the presiding officer's notice.

      (c)  If any party to the proceeding, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the oral hearing in person or by counsel or other representative, such party shall be deemed to have waived the right to add any further evidence to the record in the proceeding, or to object to the admission of any evidence; if the parties who are present are all adverse to such party, they shall have an election to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of oral testimony before the presiding officer, affidavits, or depositions.

      (d)  Complainant shall proceed first, if present at the commencement of the oral hearing.

      (e)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the presiding officer finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.

      (2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days after the presiding officer's notice stating the time of the hearing.

      (f) —(1)  The testimony of witnesses at an oral hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination. Any witness other than a party may be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses, in the discretion of the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, insofar as practicable.

      (2)  If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the presiding officer, such party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, and the presiding officer shall rule on it. The transcript or recording shall include argument or debates on objections, except as ordered by the presiding officer, and shall include the ruling of the presiding officer. Objections not made before the presiding officer may not subsequently be relied on in the proceeding.

      (3)  Whenever evidence is excluded by the presiding officer, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement, which shall be included in the transcript or recording, describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in full in the transcript or recording. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the record. In either such event, if the judicial officer decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, such evidence shall be considered a part of the record. If the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing, the presiding officer shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in full and, if the judicial officer decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.

      (4)  Except as is otherwise provided in these rules, admission of the deposition of any witness shall be subject to the provisions of rule 9, § 202.109, and affidavits, and statements under penalty of perjury as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1746, Pub. L. 94-550, may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and no party objects.

      (5)  A true copy of any written entry in any record of the Department, made by an officer or employee of the Department in the course of the official duty of such officer or employee, and relevant to the issues involved in the hearing, shall be admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the record of the Department, without the production of such officer or employee.

      (6)  (i) For each exhibit offered by a party, copies in addition to the original shall be filed with the presiding officer for the use of all other parties to the proceeding, except where the presiding officer finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable. The presiding officer shall tell the parties the number of copies required to be filed, make the proper distribution of the copies, and have this noted on the record.

      (ii) If the testimony of a witness refers to any document, the presiding officer shall determine whether it shall be produced at the hearing and made a part of the record as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated in the record by reference.

      (iii) If relevant and material matter is embraced in a document containing irrelevant or immaterial matter, such irrelevant or immaterial matter shall be designated by the party offering the document in evidence, and shall be segregated and excluded, insofar as practicable.

      (g) —(1)  The attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, from any place in the United States, on behalf of any party to the proceeding, may be required by subpoena at any designated place for oral hearing. _Subpoenas_ may be issued by the presiding officer, on a written application filed by a party, showing the grounds and necessity thereof, and, with respect to subpoenas for the production of documentary evidence, showing their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the necessity for their production. Subpoenas may be issued on the motion of the presiding officer.

      (2)  A subpoena may be served by any natural person over the age of 18 years. The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for serving it, however, at the request of such party the Secretary will attempt to serve it.

      (h)  The presiding officer shall permit oral argument by the parties or their counsel who are present at an oral hearing, but may limit such argument to any extent that the presiding officer finds necessary for the expeditious or proper disposition of the case.

      (i)  (1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the presiding officer finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the presiding officer orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The presiding officer shall certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.

      (2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the presiding officer determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the presiding officer shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.

      (3) Parties to the proceeding who desire copies of the transcript or recording of the oral hearing may make arrangements with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to such parties, upon receipt from such parties of payment for the transcript or recording, at the rate provided by the contract between the reporter and the Department for such reporting service.

      (j)  As soon as practicable after the close of the oral hearing, the reporter shall transmit to the presiding officer the original transcript or recording of the testimony, and as many copies of the transcript or recording as may be required by paragraph (i) of this section for the PSD regional offices and as may be required for the PSD headquarters office in Washington. At the same time the reporter shall also transmit a copy of the transcript or recording to each party who shall have arranged and paid for it, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Upon receipt of the transcript or recording, the presiding officer shall attach to the original transcript or recording a certificate stating that, to the best of the presiding officer's knowledge and belief, the transcript or recording is a true, correct, and complete transcript or recording of the testimony given at the hearing and that the exhibits mentioned in it are all the exhibits received in evidence at the hearing, with such exceptions as the certificate shall specify. Such certificate shall be served on each party and a copy thereof shall be attached to each copy of the transcript or recording received by the presiding officer. In accordance with such certificate the presiding officer shall note, on the original transcript or recording, each correction detailed in such certificate by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the texts as originally transcribed or recorded) at the appropriate places any words necessary to make the text conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall send the copies of the transcript or recording to the hearing clerk who shall send them to PSD headquarters.

      (k)  During the period in which the proceeding has an active status in the Department, a copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office most convenient to the respondent; however, if there are two or more respondents and they are located in different regions, such copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office nearest to the place where the hearing was held. In addition, a copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office most convenient to the complainant. Any such copy shall be available for examination during official hours of business at the regional office, but shall remain the property of the Department and shall not be removed from such office.

      § 202.113   Rule 13: Written hearing.

#### § § 202.113

      (a)  As used in this section, the term “evidence” shall mean depositions, affidavits, or statements under penalty of perjury as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1746, Pub. L. 94-550, of persons having knowledge of the facts, or documents properly identified by such deposition, affidavit, or statement, or otherwise authenticated in such a manner that they would be admissible in evidence at an oral hearing, except as provided hereinafter. Testimony on deposition, to the extent credible, shall be given greater weight as evidence, than such affidavits or statements. In a case in which a party, entitled to oral hearing as provided in rule 11, § 202.111, withdraws such party's request for oral hearing on condition that only depositions be used if a written hearing is held, only depositions, and documents properly identified therein, shall be made a part of the record as evidence by the parties if a written hearing is held.

      (b)  Any facts must be verified, by oath or affirmation before a person legally authorized to administer oaths or before a person designated by the Secretary for the purpose (except in the case of a statement under penalty of perjury as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1746, Pub. L. 94-550), by a person who states, in the deposition, affidavit, or statement, that such person has actual knowledge of the facts. Except under unusual circumstances, which shall be set forth in the deposition, affidavit, or statement, any such person shall be one who would appear as a witness if an oral hearing were held.

      (c)  The complainant shall be served with notice of an opportunity to file evidence. Within 20 days after such service, the complainant may file evidence. What the complainant files in response to that notice shall be served promptly on the respondent.

      (d)  After expiration of the time for the filing of complainant's evidence, the respondent shall be served with notice of an opportunity to file evidence. Within 20 days after such service, the respondent may file evidence. What the respondent files in response to that notice shall be served promptly on the complainant.

      (e)  If the respondent files anything pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the complainant shall be served with notice of an opportunity to file evidence in rebuttal of what the respondent has filed. Within 20 days after such service, the complainant may file such evidence, which shall be confined strictly to rebuttal of what the respondent has filed. What the complainant files in response to that notice shall be served promptly on the respondent.

      (f)  Failure to file any evidence authorized under this section, within the time prescribed, shall constitute a waiver of the right to file such evidence.

      (g)  If any party timely files an application for an order for the taking of testimony by deposition pursuant to rule 9, § 202.109, time for the filing of such party's evidence shall be extended as reasonable, to permit consideration of the application, and taking of depositions if ordered.

      (h)  No provision of this rule 13 shall change the status of an investigation report served on the parties and made a part of the record pursuant to rule 4, § 202.104.

      (b)  After filing of the last evidence in a written hearing, notice shall be served on each party that such party may file, within 20 days after such service on such party, written argument of brief, proposed findings or fact, conclusions, and order.

      (c)  If any such document is filed by any party, it shall be served on all other parties. The report shall not be prepared before expiration of such time for filing.

#### § § 202.115

      (a)  The presiding officer, with the assistance and collaboration of such employees of the Department as may be assigned for the purpose, shall prepare a report. The report shall be prepared on the basis of the evidence in the record, including the investigation report if one is prepared by the agency head and served on the parties, and any allegations admitted or deemed to be admitted, and any stipulations. The report shall be prepared in the form of a final order for signature by the judicial officer, and shall be filed with the hearing clerk. The report shall not be served on the parties unless and until it is signed by the judicial officer.

      (b)  At the same time as the report is filed with the hearing clerk, the record shall also be filed with the hearing clerk. The record shall include: Pleadings; motions and requests filed and rulings thereon; the investigation report if one is prepared by the agency head and served on the parties; the transcript or recording of an oral hearing, and exhibits received, if an oral hearing was held; evidence filed by the parties if a written hearing was held; documents filed in connection with pre-hearing conferences; any proposed findings of fact, conclusions and orders, statements of objections, and briefs; any stipulations; and proof of service.

      (c)  Unless the hearing clerk reasonably believes that the record is not complete and in proper order, the record and the report shall be submitted to the judicial officer for decision.

      (d)  There shall be no right to oral argument other than that provided in rule 12(h), § 202.112(h).

      § 202.116   Rule 16: Issuance of order.

#### § § 202.116

      (a) As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record and report from the hearing clerk, the judicial officer, on the basis of and after due consideration of the record, shall issue an order in the proceeding, which shall be served on the parties.

      (b) If the judicial officer deems it advisable to do so, the order may be made a tentative order. In such event, a presiding officer shall be assigned and the tentative order shall be served on each party, and each party shall have 20 days in which to file written exceptions to it, and arguments or briefs in support of such exceptions. If no party timely files exceptions, the tentative order shall automatically become the final order in the proceeding, and notice of such fact shall be served on the parties. If any party timely files such exceptions, they shall be handled in the same manner as a petition filed under rule 17, § 202.117.

      § 202.117   Rule 17: Petition to reopen a hearing; to rehear or reargue a proceeding; to reconsider an order; or to set aside a default order.

#### § § 202.117

      (a) —(1)  Any party may file a petition to reopen a hearing to take further evidence, at any time prior to the issuance of the final order, or prior to a tentative order becoming final. Such a petition must state the nature and purpose of the evidence to be offered, show that it is not merely cumulative, and state a good reason why it was not offered at the hearing if oral, or filed in the hearing if written.

      (2)  Any party may file a petition to rehear or reargue a proceeding or reconsider an order of the judicial officer, at any time within 20 days after service on such party of such order. Such a petition must specify the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and the basis for the petitioner's claim that such matters were erroneously decided.

      (3)  Any respondent against whom an order is issued by the judicial officer, upon failure to file an answer as required, may file a petition to set aside such order, at any time within 20 days after service on such respondent of such order. Such a petition must state a good reason why an answer was not filed as required.

      (b)  If such a petitioner wishes to file a brief or memorandum of law in support of such a petition, it must be filed with such petition.

      (c)  A presiding officer shall be assigned upon the filing of any such petition, or upon notice to the hearing clerk (which may be written or oral, or by telephone) that any party intends to file any such petition. The party filing any such petition shall be referred to as the complainant or respondent, depending on the original designation of such party in the proceeding; such party shall have the burden of establishing that such petition should be granted. If a petition to reopen is timely filed, the order shall not be issued pending decision whether to grant or deny the petition. If a petition to rehear or reargue or reconsider, or to set aside a default order, is timely filed, operation of the order shall be stayed automatically pending decision whether to grant or deny it; if such a petition is not timely filed, operation of the order shall not be stayed unless the Judicial Officer shall determine otherwise.

      (d)  No such petition shall be granted unless it, with the brief or memorandum of law in support of it, if any, is first served on each party to the proceeding other than the one filing it. Each such other party, within 20 days after such service on such party, may file an answer to such petition. If any such party wishes to file a brief or memorandum of law in support of such an answer, it must be filed with such answer. Any such answer, with the brief or memorandum of law in support of it, if any, shall be served on each party to the proceeding other than the one filing it. Any such petition may be denied without such service.

      (e)  The presiding officer shall prepare a recommendation with respect to the petition, and submit it to the judicial officer for decision. Such a recommendation shall be prepared in the form of a final order for signature by the judicial officer. It shall not be served on the parties unless and until it is signed by the judicial officer. The order of the judicial officer shall be served on the parties.

      (f)  If the judicial officer decides to reopen a hearing, or to rehear or permit reargument of a proceeding, or to set aside a default order, a presiding officer shall be assigned and the rules of practice shall be followed thereafter as applicable.

      § 202.118   Rule 18: Presiding officer.

#### § § 202.118

      (a)  Subject to review as provided elsewhere in these rules, the presiding officer assigned to any proceeding shall have power to:

      (12) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance of order and the efficient conduct of the proceeding, including the exclusion of contumacious counsel or other persons.

      (b)  The presiding officer is authorized to rule on all motions and requests filed in the proceeding prior to submission of the presiding officer's report to the judicial officer,  That a presiding officer is not authorized to dismiss a complaint. Submission or certification of any question to the judicial officer, prior to submission of the report, shall be in the discretion of the presiding officer.

      (c)  For any good reason, including absence, illness, resignation, death, or inability to act, of the attorney assigned to act as a presiding officer in any proceeding under these rules, the powers and duties of such attorney in the proceeding may be assigned to any other attorney who is employed in the Office of the General Counsel of the Department, without abatement of the proceeding.

      (d)  No person shall be assigned to act as a presiding officer in any proceeding who (1) has any material pecuniary interest in any matter or business involved in the proceeding; (2) is related within the third degree by blood or marriage to any party to the proceeding; or (3) has any conflict of interest which might impair such person's objectivity in the proceeding. A person assigned to act as a presiding officer shall ask to be replaced, in any proceeding in which such person believes that reason exists for disqualification of such person.

      (e)  Any party may file a petition for disqualification of the presiding officer, which shall set forth with particularity the grounds of alleged disqualification. Any such petition shall be filed with the hearing clerk, who shall immediately transmit it to the judicial officer and inform the presiding officer. The record of the proceeding also shall immediately be transmitted to the judicial officer. After such investigation or hearing as the judicial officer deems necessary, the judicial officer shall either deny the petition or direct that another presiding officer be assigned to the proceeding. The petition, and notice of the order of the judicial officer, shall be made a part of the record and served on the parties; if any record is made on such a petition, it shall be a part of the record of the proceeding.

  PART 203—STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY UNDER THE PACKERS AND STOCKYARDS ACT

### Part 203

**Authority:** Authority: 7 CFR 2.22 and 2.81.

    § 203.1   [Reserved]

#### § § 203.1

    § 203.2   Statement of general policy with respect to the giving by meat packers of meat and other gifts to Government employees.

#### § § 203.2

    (a) In recent months, the Department has received information, confirmed by investigation, that a number of packers subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act have made gifts of meat to Government employees responsible for conducting service activities of the Department. Such gifts have the implications of fraud, even if not made specifically for the purpose of influencing these employees in the performance of their duties.

    (b) It is a violation of the Meat Inspection Act for any person, firm, or corporation to give to any employee of the Department performing duties under such act anything of value with intent to influence such employee in the discharge of his duties, or for such employee to receive from any person, firm, or corporation engaged in interstate or foreign commerce any gift given with any intent or purpose whatsoever (21 U.S.C. 90). Under the Federal meat grading regulations, the giving or attempting to give by a packer of anything of value to any employee of the Department authorized to perform any function under such regulations is a basis for the withdrawal of Federal meat grading service (7 CFR 53.13). The receiving by an employee of the Department of any gift from any person for whom grading, inspection, or other service work is performed is specifically prohibited by Departmental regulations.

    (c) Upon the basis of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, it is the view of the Department that it is an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of section 202(a) of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 192(a)) for any person subject to the provisions of Title II of said Act to give or offer to give meat, money, or anything of value to any Government employee who performs inspection, grading, reporting, or regulatory duties directly relating to the purchase or sale of livestock or the preparation or distribution of meats, meat food products, livestock products in unmanufactured form, poultry or poultry products.

#### § § 203.3

    § 203.4   Statement with respect to the disposition of records by packers, live poultry dealers, stockyard owners, market agencies and dealers.

#### § § 203.4

    (a)  Section 401 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 221) provides, in part, that every packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, and dealer shall keep such accounts, records, and memoranda as fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business, including the true ownership of such business by stockholding or otherwise. In order to properly administer the P&S Act, it is necessary that records be retained for such periods of time as may be required to permit the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD) a reasonable opportunity to examine such records. Section 401 of the Act does not, however, provide for the destruction or disposal of records. Therefore, the Department has formulated this policy statement to provide guidance as to the periods of time after which records may be disposed of or destroyed.

    (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, and dealer may destroy or dispose of accounts, records, and memoranda which contain, explain, or modify transactions in its business subject to the Act after such accounts, records, and memoranda have been retained for a period of two full years;  That the following records made or kept by a packer may be disposed of after one year: cutting tests; departmental transfers; buyers' estimates; drive sheets; scale tickets received from others; inventory and products in storage; receiving records; trial balances; departmental overhead or expense recapitulations; bank statements, reconciliations and deposit slips; production or sale tonnage reports (including recapitulations and summaries of routes, branches, plants, etc.); buying or selling pricing instructions and price lists; correspondence; telegrams; teletype communications and memoranda relating to matters other than contracts, agreements, purchase or sales invoices, or claims or credit memoranda; and  That microfilm copies of records may be substituted for and retained in lieu of the actual records.

    (c)  The periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be extended if the packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer is notified in writing by the Administrator that specified records should be retained for a longer period pending the completion of any investigation or proceedings under the Act.

    (d)  If it is found that any person subject to the Act has disposed of accounts, records, and memoranda which are necessary to fully and correctly disclose all transactions in its business prior to the periods specified in this statement, consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging a violation of section 401 of the Act and seeking an appropriate order. The administrative proceeding initiated will be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 ).

    § 203.5   Statement with respect to market agencies paying the expenses of livestock buyers.

#### § § 203.5

    It has become a practice in certain areas of the country for market agencies, engaged in the business of selling consigned livestock on a commission basis, to pay certain of the business or personal expenses incurred by buyers attending livestock sales conducted by such market agencies, such as, expenses for meals, lodging, travel, entertainment and long distance telephone calls. Investigation by the Department, discloses that this practice tends to become a method of competition between similarly engaged market agencies and results in undue and unreasonable cost burdens on such market agencies and the livestock producers who sell their livestock through such market agencies.

    It is the view of the Department that it constitutes violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended (7 U.S.C. 181 ), for any market agency engaged in the business of selling consigned livestock on a commission basis, to pay, directly or indirectly, any personal or business expenses of livestock buyers attending sales conducted by such market agency. In the future, if any market agency engages in such practice, consideration will be given by the PSD to the issuance of a complaint charging the market agency with violation of the Act. In the formal administrative proceeding initiated by any such complaint, the Judicial Officer of the Department will determine, after full hearing, whether the market agency has violated the Act and should be ordered to cease and desist from continuing such violation, and whether the registration of such market agency should be suspended for a reasonable period of time.

    § 203.6   [Reserved]

#### § § 203.6

    § 203.7   Statement with respect to meat packer sales and purchase contracts.

#### § § 203.7

    (a) The PSD receives numerous complaints concerning the failure or refusal of buyers to pay the full purchase price for, or to accept delivery of, their purchases of meat and meat food products and sellers failing to meet contractual specifications. Most such complaints arise out of disputes concerning condition, grade, weight, or shipping instructions.

    (b) It is believed that both seller and buyer should take the following points into consideration when selling and buying meat and meat food products:

    (1)  Terms and conditions of shipment and delivery should be specified in the contract and both parties should understand fully all terms and conditions of the contract. Any deviation from normal practices, such as a guaranty by the shipper as to the date of arrival at destination, or a deviation from the normal meaning of terms, should also be fully understood and made a part of the contract.

    (2)  (i) A seller has the responsibility of making certain that the meat and meat food products shipped are in accordance with the terms of the contract specifications.

    (ii) When a buyer believes that the shipment does not meet the terms of the contract, he should immediately contact the seller or the seller's agent and advise him of the nature of the complaint. This affords the seller an opportunity to renegotiate the contract, to personally inspect the meat or meat food products, or to have an impartial party inspect or examine the meat or meat food products. Inspection and examination service of this type is available nationally through the USDA meat grading service and locally through various impartial persons or agencies.

    (iii) All terms of a transaction should be made clear in the contract, whether written or verbal. If there is any chance of misunderstanding, a written confirmation should be exchanged between the parties. In any case where a contract dispute cannot be settled between the parties and either party intends to file a complaint, such complaint should be brought to the attention of the nearest PSD regional office as soon as possible. However, a concerted effort on the part of both buyer and seller to negotiate clear and complete contracts will greatly reduce misunderstandings which can result in the filing of complaints with PSD.

    (c) If the PSD has reason to believe that any packer unjustifiably (1) has refused to pay the contractual price for meat or meat food products purchased, (2) has refused to accept a shipment of meat or meat food products, or (3) has failed to ship meat or meat food products in accordance with the terms of the contract specifications, consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging the packer with violation of section 202 of the Act. In the formal administrative proceeding initiated by any such complaint, the Judicial Officer of the Department will determine, upon the basis of the record in the proceeding, whether the packer has violated the Act and should be ordered to cease and desist from continuing such violation.

#### § §§ 203.8-203.9

    § 203.10   Statement with respect to insolvency; definition of current assets and current liabilities.

#### § § 203.10

    (a) Under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended and supplemented (7 U.S.C. 181 ), the principal test of insolvency is to determine whether a person's current liabilities exceed his current assets. This current ratio test of insolvency under the Act has been reviewed and affirmed by a United States Court of Appeals.  363 F. 2d 81 (5th Cir. 1966).

    (b) For the purposes of the administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:

    (1)  means cash and other assets or resources commonly identified as those which are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business, which is considered to be one year.

    (2)  means obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use of existing resources principally classifiable as current assets or the creation of other current liabilities during the one year operating cycle of the business.

    (c) The term current assets generally includes: (1) Cash in bank or on hand; (2) sums due a market agency from a custodial account for shippers' proceeds; (3) accounts receivable, if collectible; (4) notes receivable and portions of long-term notes receivable within one year from date of balance sheet, if collectable; (5) inventories of livestock acquired for purposes of resale or for purposes of market support; (6) feed inventories and other inventories which are intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle of the business; (7) accounts due from employees, if collectable; (8) accounts due from officers of a corporation, if collectable; (9) accounts due from affiliates and subsidiaries of corporations if the financial position of such subsidiaries and affiliates justifies such classification; (10) marketable securities representing cash available for current operations and not otherwise pledged as security; (11) accrued interest receivable; and (12) prepaid expenses.

    (d) The term current assets generally excludes: (1) Cash and claims to cash which are restricted as to withdrawal, such as custodial funds for shippers' proceeds and current proceeds receivable from the sale of livestock sold on a commission basis; (2) investments in securities (whether marketable or not) or advances which have been made for the purposes of control, affiliation, or other continuing business advantage; (3) receivables which are not expected to be collected within 12 months; (4) cash surrender value of life insurance policies; (5) land and other natural resources; and (6) depreciable assets.

    (e) The term current liabilities generally includes: (1) Bank overdrafts (per books); (2) amounts due a custodial account for shippers' proceeds; (3) accounts payable within one year from date of balance sheet; (4) notes payable or portions thereof due and payable within one year from date of balance sheet; (5) accruals such as taxes, wages, social security, unemployment compensation, etc., due and payable as of the date of the balance sheet; and (6) all other liabilities whose regular and ordinary liquidation is expected to occur within one year.

#### § § 203.11

    § 203.12   Statement with respect to providing services and facilities at stockyards on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.

#### § § 203.12

    (a) Section 304 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 205) provides that: “All stockyard services furnished pursuant to reasonable request made to a stockyard owner or market agency at such stockyard shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory and stockyard services which are furnished shall not be refused on any basis that is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory….”

    (b) Section 305 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 206) states that: “All rates or charges made for any stockyard services furnished at a stockyard by a stockyard owner or market agency shall be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory….”

    (c) Section 307 (7 U.S.C. 208) provides that: “It shall be the duty of every stockyard owner and market agency to establish, observe, and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations and practices in respect to the furnishing of stockyard services….”

    (d) Section 312(a) (7 U.S.C. 213(a)) provides that: “It shall be unlawful for any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device in connection with determining whether persons should be authorized to operate at the stockyards, or with the receiving, marketing, buying, or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing or handling, in commerce, of livestock.”

    (e) Section 301(b) (7 U.S.C. 201(b)) defines “stockyard services” as any “services or facilities furnished at a stockyard in connection with the receiving, buying, or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, marketing, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing, or handling, in commerce, of livestock.”

    (f) It is the view of the Department that it is a violation of sections 304, 307, and 312(a) of the Act for a stockyard owner or market agency to discriminate, in the furnishing of stockyard services or facilities or in establishing rules or regulations at the stockyard, because of race, religion, color, or national origin of those persons using the stockyard services or facilities. Such services and facilities include, but are not limited to, the restaurant, restrooms, drinking fountains, lounge accommodations, those furnished for the selling, weighing, or other handling of the livestock, and facilities for observing such services.

    (g) If the PSD has reason to believe that any stockyard owner or market agency has so discriminated in the furnishing of stockyard services or facilities, consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging the stockyard or market agency with violations of the Act.

    § 203.15   Trust benefits under sections 206, 207, and 318 of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

#### § § 203.15

    (a) Within the times specified under sections 206(b), 207(d), and 318(b) of the Act, any livestock seller, live poultry seller or grower, to preserve their interest in the statutory trust, must give written notice to the appropriate packer, live poultry dealer, or livestock dealer and file such notice with the Secretary within the prescribed time by letter, fax, email, or other electronic transmission. The written notice should provide:

    (1) Notification to preserve trust benefits;

    (2) Identification of packer, live poultry dealer, or livestock dealer;

    (3) Identification of seller or poultry grower;

    (4) Date of the transaction;

    (5) Date of seller's or poultry grower's receipt of notice that payment instrument has been dishonored (if applicable); and

    (6) Amount of money due; and to make certain that a copy of such letter, fax, email, or other electronic transmission is filed with a PSD regional office or with the PSD headquarters office within the prescribed time.

    (b) While the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section is desirable, any written notice which informs the packer, live poultry dealer, or livestock dealer, and the Secretary that the packer, live poultry dealer, or livestock dealer has failed to pay is sufficient to meet the statutory requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if it is given within the prescribed time.

    (c) For purposes of administering statutory trusts under the Act, a  means a sale in which the seller does not expressly extend credit to the buyer.

    § 203.16   Mailing of checks in payment for livestock purchased for slaughter, for cash and not on credit.

#### § § 203.16

    (a) The Department recognizes that one who sells livestock to a packer, market agency, or dealer, who is purchasing for slaughter, may not intend to be present at the point of transfer of possession of the livestock, to receive payment, at the time a check in payment for such livestock may be delivered by the purchaser, and may not wish to authorize a representative to receive such a check; or for other reasons such a seller may prefer that such a purchaser make payment by mailing a check within the time limit as prescribed in section 409(a) of the Act. In cases when the seller does not intend to be present, he may use the following form of notification to the purchaser:

    (b) The Department believes that such an agreement would not constitute an extension of credit within the meaning of section 206 of the Act because it would not give the purchaser any more time to issue a check than is provided in section 409(a).

    § 203.17   Statement of general policy with respect to rates and charges at posted stockyards.

#### § § 203.17

    (a) Requests have been received from stockyard operators, market agencies, and livestock producers urging a reduction of rate regulation at posted stockyards. Their requests are based on the belief that competition among markets will set a level of rates and charges fair to both the market operator and to the livestock producer. PSD will accept for filing tariffs containing any level of charges after 10 days' notice to the public and to the Secretary as required by the Act.

    (b) PSD will not investigate the level of rates and charges established by stockyard owners and market agencies for reasonableness except upon receipt of a valid complaint or under compelling circumstances warranting such an investigation. Stockyard owners and market agencies will have substantial flexibility in setting their own rates and charges.

    (c) Complaints filed about the reasonableness of rates and charges will be investigated to determine the validity of such complaints and appropriate action taken if warranted.

    (d) PSD will continue to insure that the schedules of rates and charges filed with the Department are applied uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory manner.

    § 203.18   Statement with respect to packers engaging in the business of custom feeding livestock.

#### § § 203.18

    (a) In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Department has sought to promote and maintain open and fair competition in the livestock and packing industries, and to prevent unfair or anticompetitive practices when they are found to exist. It is the opinion of the Department that the ownership or operation of custom feedlots by packers presents problems which may under some circumstances result in violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

    (b) Packers contemplating entering into such arrangements with custom feedlots are encouraged to consult with the Administration prior to the commencement of such activities. Custom feedlots are not only places of production, but are also important marketing centers, and in connection with the operation of a custom feedlot, it is customary for the feedlot operator to assume responsibility for marketing fed livestock for the accounts of feedlot customers. When a custom feedlot is owned or operated by a packer, and when such packer purchases fed livestock from the feedlot, this method of operation potentially gives rise to a conflict of interest. In such situations, the packer's interest in the fed livestock as a buyer is in conflict with its obligations to feedlot customers to market their livestock to the customer's best advantage. Under these circumstances, the packer should take appropriate measures to eliminate any conflict of interest. At a minimum, such measures should insure:

    (1) That feedlot customers are fully advised of the common ties between the feedlot and the packer, and of their rights and options with respect to the marketing of their livestock;

    (2) That all feedlot customers are treated equally by the packer/custom feedlot in connection with the marketing of fed livestock; and

    (3) That marketing decisions rest solely with the feedlot customer unless otherwise expressly agreed.

    (c) Packer ownership or operation of custom feedlots may also give rise to competitive problems in some situations. Packers contemplating or engaging in the business of operating a custom feedlot should carefully review their operations to assure that no restriction of competition exists or is likely to occur.

    (d) The Department does not consider the existence of packer/custom feedlot relationships, by itself, to constitute a violation of the Act. In the event it appears that a packer/custom feedlot arrangement gives rise to a violation of the Act, an investigation will be made on a case-by-case basis, and, where warranted, appropriate action will be taken.

    § 203.19   Statement with respect to packers engaging in the business of livestock dealers or buying agencies.

#### § § 203.19

    (a) In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Department has sought to prevent conflicts of interest and to maintain open and fair competition in the livestock and meat packing industries. The ownership or operation of livestock dealers or buying agencies by packers, under some circumstances, may result in violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

    (b) Traditionally, livestock dealers and buying agencies purchase livestock for resale or to fill orders for farmers, ranchers, producers, other livestock firms and packers. When a livestock dealer or buying agency is owned or operated by a packer, and when such packer is also buying livestock for its own operational requirements, there is a potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, the purchase and sale of livestock by meat packers may result in control of markets and prices which could adversely affect both livestock producers, competing packers, and consumers.

    (c) Arrangements between packers and dealers or buying agencies which do not normally create a conflict of interest or result in a restraint of competition include:

    (1) Operations utilizing different species or classes of livestock;

    (2) Operations where the business activities are widely separated geographically; and

    (3) Operations where tie-in purchases or sales are not involved. Packers contemplating engaging in the business of a livestock dealer or a buying agency are encouraged to consult with the PSD prior to the commencement of such activities.

    (d) In the event a packer/dealer or a packer/buying agency arrangement appears to give rise to a violation of the Act, an investigation will be made on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, appropriate action will be taken.

      § 205.105   Master list and portion thereof distributed to registrants—format.

#### § § 205.105

      (a) The master list must contain all the information on all the EFS's filed in the system, so arranged that it is possible to deliver to any registrant all such information relating to any product, produced or located in any county or parish (or all counties or parishes), for any crop year, covered by the system. The system must be able to deliver all such information to any registrant, either in alphabetical order by the word appearing first in the name of each person subjecting a product to a security interest (see § 205.102), in numerical order by social security number or approved unique identifier (or, if other than a natural person, IRS taxpayer identification number or approved unique identifier) of each such person, or in both alphabetical and numerical orders, as requested by the registrant.

      (b) Section (c)(2)(E) requires the portion to be distributed in “written or printed form.” This means recording on paper by any technology in a form that can be read by humans without special equipment. The system may, however, honor requests from registrants to substitute recordings on any medium by any technology including, but not limited to, electronic recording on tapes or discs in machine-readable form, and on photographic recording on microfiche. It also includes, if requested by registrants, electronic transmissions whereby registrants can print their own paper copies.

      (c) After distribution of a portion of a master list, there can be supplementary distribution of a portion showing only changes from the previous one. However, if this is done, cumulative supplements must be distributed often enough that readers can find all the information given to them for any one crop year in no more than three distributions.

    Interpretive opinions

      § 205.201   System operator.

#### § § 205.201

      The system operator can be the Secretary of State of a State, or any designee of the State pursuant to its laws. Note that the provision in subsection (c)(2) for a system refers to operation by the Secretary of State of a State, but the definition in (c)(11) of “Secretary of State” includes “designee of the State.”

      § 205.202   “Effective financing statement” or EFS.

#### § § 205.202

      (a) An EFS under subsection (c)(4) need not be the same as a financing statement or security agreement under the Uniform Commercial Code (or equivalent document under future successor State law), but can be an entirely separate document meeting the definition in (c)(4). Note that (c)(4) contains a comprehensive definition of the term which does not include any requirement that the EFS be the instrument by which a security interest is created or perfected. Note also the House Committee Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-271, Part 1, September 13, 1985, at page 110: “[T]he bill would not preempt basic state-law rules on the creation, perfection, or priority of security interests.”

      (b) An EFS may be filed electronically provided a State allows electronic filing of financing statements without the signature of the debtor under applicable State law under provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or may be a paper document. An electronically filed EFS need not be a paper document and need not be signed. If an original or reproduced paper document of an EFS is filed with the State, it must be signed, authorized, or otherwise authenticated by the debtor and be filed by the secured party.

      (c) Countermeasures against mishandling after filing, such as a requirement that a copy be date stamped and returned to the secured party, are discretionary with the State. If a State chooses to adopt such countermeasures, it is responsible for establishing procedures for recording the date and time when an EFS is received, and for meeting all legal requirements associated with filing and distributing information about security interests as required by § 205.101.

      § 205.203   Place of filing EFS.

#### § § 205.203

      The place of filing an EFS is wherever State law requires, which need not be with the system operator so long as the system operator receives the information needed for the master list, including the information required in subsection (c)(4)(C). Note that the requirements in subsection (c)(4) for an EFS include the requirement that it be “filed with the Secretary of State,” but the definition in (c)(11) of “Secretary of State” includes ”designee of the State,” and the requirements in (c)(2) for a system refer in (A) to filing with the system operator of “effective financing statements  (emphasis added)

      § 205.204   Filing “notice” of EFS.

#### § § 205.204

      (a) If an EFS is filed somewhere other than with the system operator, and if notice of it is filed with the system operator, such notice could be electronic filing, telephoned information, or any other form of notice which gives the system operator the information needed for the master list. Such notice need not be signed. Note that the Section does not contain any requirement for such notice except the one in subsection (c)(4)(B) that an EFS must be filed somewhere pursuant to State law as discussed above.

      (b) Countermeasures against falsifications, errors or omissions in such notices or in the handling of them by the system operator, such as requirements that the notices be on paper and signed, with copies date-stamped and returned to the persons filing them, however advisable they might be from other standpoints, are discretionary with the State and not required by the Section.

      § 205.205   Fees.

#### § § 205.205

      The Section provides at subsection (c)(4)(G) for a fee for filing an EFS. The fee can be set in any manner provided by the law of the State in which such EFS is filed. The basis for this is that (c)(4)(G) provides for the fee to be set by the “Secretary of State” but (c)(11) defines the latter term to include “designee of the State.” The fee structure is discretionary with the State.

      § 205.206   Farm products.

#### § § 205.206

      (a) The master list must be organized by farm product as required by subsection (c)(2) and the farm product must be identified on an EFS as required by subsection (c)(4)(C)(iv). The following is a list of such farm products.

      (b) Note the definition of the term “farm product” at subsection (c)(5), and the Conference Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-447, December 17, 1985, at page 486.

      (c) A State may establish a system for specified products and not for all. A State establishing a system for specified products and not for all will be deemed to be “a State that has established a central filing system” as to the specified products, and will be deemed not to be such a State as to other products.

      § 205.207   “Amount” and “County or parish”.

#### § § 205.207

      (a) The “amount” of farm products and “county or parish,” on an EFS and on the master list under subsection (c)(4)(C)(iv) and (2)(C)(iii), need not be shown on every EFS and master list entry.

      (b) Any EFS and master list entry will identify a product. If they do not show an amount, this constitutes a representation that all of such product owned by the person in question is subject to the security interest in question.

      (c) Any EFS and master list entry will identify each county or parish in the same State where the product is produced or located. If they do not show any further identification of the location of the product, this constitutes a representation that all such product produced in each such county or parish, owned by such person, is subject to the security interest.

      (d) The need to supply additional information arises only where some of that product owned by that person is subject to the security interest and some is not.

      (e) The additional information about amount must be sufficient to enable a reader of the information to identify what product owned by that person is subject, as distinguished from what of the same product owned by the same person is not subject. The precision needed, in the description of the amount, would vary from case to case.

      (f) The basis for this is the purpose of the entire exercise, to make information available as necessary to enable an identification of what product is subject to a security interest as distinguished from what is not.

      § 205.208   Distribution of portions of master list—registration—information to non-registrants on request.

#### § § 205.208

      (a) The provisions in the Section regarding registration of “buyers of farm products, commission merchants, and selling agents,” “regular” distribution of “portions” of the master list, furnishing of “oral confirmation * * * on request,” and the effect of all this, that is, subsections (c)(2) (D), (E) and (F), (e) (2) and (3), and (g)(2) (C) and (D), must be read together.

      (b) The Section does not require such persons to register. Not registering with a particular system operator has the effect, under subsections (e)(2) and (g)(2)(C), of making such persons, whether they are inside or outside the State covered by that system, subject to security interests shown on that system's master list whether or not such persons know about them, so that such persons for their own protection will need to query the system operator about any seller “engaged in farming operations,” of a farm product produced in the State covered by that system, with whom they deal.

      (c) The effect of registration by such persons with a particular system is to get them on the list for regular distribution of portions of that system's master list, the portions to be determined by the registration. They are subject only to security interests shown on the portions which they receive, and are not subject to such interests as are shown on the master list but not shown on portions which they receive. Also, if a particular security interest is shown on the master list, but has been placed on it since the last regular distribution of portions of that list to registrants, registrants would not be subject to that security interest. These conclusions are based on the provisions in subsections (e)(3)(A) and (g)(2)(D)(i) that such persons are subject to a security interest only if they receive “written notice * * * that specifies both the seller and the farm product.”

      (d) A question arises as to the length of time for which a registration is effective, and whether a registrant, wishing to change registration as to county or product, can amend an existing registration or must file a new one. This is discretionary with the State since the Section is silent about it.

      (e) A question arises whether persons can register to receive only portions of the list for products in which they do not deal, and thus not be subject to security interests in products in which they deal because they are registrants but do not receive written notice of them. For example, can cattle dealers register to receive portions of the master list only for oranges, and thus take cattle free and clear of security interests shown on the master list, but as to which they do not receive written notice because they have not registered to receive the portion for cattle? Registrants will be deemed to be registered only  of the master list for which they register, and will be deemed to have failed to register _as to those portions_ for which they do not register.

      (f) The Section requires “regular” distribution, to registrants, of portions of the master list as amended from time to time by the filing of EFS's and amendments to EFS's. The requirement that the distribution be “regular” necessarily refers to an interval specified in advance. The interval may vary according to product and region. The frequency of such distribution must be a consideration in review for certification since distribution must be timely to serve its purpose. While subsection (c)(2)(E) (providing that distribution be made “regularly as prescribed by the State”) gives each State discretion to choose the interval between distributions, whatever interval a State chooses will inevitably make possible some transactions in which security interests are filed in the system but registrants are not subject to them.

      (g) Legislative history of the Section shows that buyers, commission merchants, and selling agents are not intended to be liable for errors or other inaccuracies generated by the system. See Nov. 22, 1985 Cong. Rec., Senate, pg. S16300, and Dec. 18, 1985 Cong. Rec., House, pg. H12523.

      (h) In _furnishing_ to non-registrants “oral confirmation within 24 hours of any [EFS] on request followed by written confirmation,” by a system operator pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(F), any failure in use of a telephone caused by a “busy signal” could not be the basis of liability of the system operator. The basis for this is that subsection (c)(2)(F) does not mention telephones. Also, while it mentions  information orally, it does not contain any provision as to how queries are to be  that is, orally, in writing, or otherwise.

      (i) Of course it is to be expected that telephones would be used in most cases, but use of them is not required by the legislation and is discretionary with the State.

      (j) In the matter of receiving queries and giving oral replies to them, subsection (c)(2)(F) will be complied with if a system operator maintains an office and staff where a query can be received on business days and during business hours such as are regular in the State, and where an oral reply will be available on the regular business day following the day on which the query is received, at or before the time of day when it was received.

      (k) Written confirmation is required, by subsection (c)(2)(F), to be given to any non-registered buyer, commission merchant, or selling agent.

      (l) Such a written confirmation pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(F) does not alter the liability of the non-registrant querying the system and receiving information about a security interest recorded in it. The basis of this, as above, is that non-registrants are subject to security interests recorded in a system whether or not they know about them, and must query the system for their own protection.

      (m) The Section does not specify when or how the written confirmation must be furnished, but provides only that it must follow the oral information. Thus the time and method of furnishing written confirmation is discretionary with the State.

      § 205.209   Amendment or continuation of EFS.

#### § § 205.209

      (a) The “material change,” required by subsection (c)(4)(D) to be reflected in an amendment to an EFS and master list entry, is whatever change would render the master list entry no longer informative as to what is subject to the security interest in question. That will vary from case to case. The basis for this is the purpose for which the information is supplied, that is, to make information available, to a buyer, commission merchant, or selling agent who proposes to enter into a transaction in a product, whether it is subject to a security interest. The requirement to amend arises when the information already made available no longer serves the purpose and other information is needed in order to do so.

      (b) Where an owner of a product makes a change, such as planting a different crop or purchasing different animals from what was represented, without informing the secured party, so that the master list entry is rendered not informative, but the EFS and master list are not amended through no fault of the secured party, the Section is silent as to the consequences. However, see the legislative history cited in § 205.208(f).

      (c) The amendment must be filed in the same manner as the original filing. Note the requirement of subsection (c)(4)(D). The amendment may be filed electronically provided a State allows electronic filing of financing statements without the signature of the debtor under applicable State law under provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code. An electronically filed amendment need not be signed. However, if an original or reproduced paper document is filed, the amendment must be signed, authorized, or otherwise authenticated by the debtor, and be filed by the secured party.

      (d) An effective financing statement remains effective for a period of 5 years from the date of filing and may be continued in increments of 5-year periods beyond the initial 5-year filing period by refiling an effective financing statement or by filing a continuation statement within 6 months before expiration of the effective financing statement. A continuation statement may be filed electronically or as a paper document, and need not be signed, authorized, or otherwise authenticated by the debtor.

      § 205.210   Effect of EFS outside State in which filed.

#### § § 205.210

      (a) A question arises whether, if an EFS is filed in one State, a notice of it can be filed in another State and shown on the master list for the second State. There is nothing in the Section to prevent this, but it would serve no purpose.

      (b) The Section provides only for filing an EFS, covering a given product, in the system for the State in which it is produced or located. Upon such filing in such system, subsections (e)(2) and (g)(2)(C) make buyers, commission merchants and selling agents  with that system subject to the security interest in that product whether or not they know about it,  Subsections (e)(3) and (g)(2)(D) make persons  with that system subject if they receive written notice of it  All of these provisions apply only where an EFS is filed in the system for the State in which the product is produced or located. They do not apply to a filing in another system.

      (c) What constitutes “receipt” of notice is determined by the law of the State in which the intended recipient of notice resides. This is based on subsection (f) which follows provisions for notice to buyers, and (g)(3) which follows provisions for notice to commission merchants and selling agents. Each of those provisions uses the word “buyer” but it means “intended recipient of notice.”

      § 205.211   Applicability of court decisions under the UCC.

#### § § 205.211

      (a) Court decisions under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), about the scope of the “farm products” exception in Section 9-307(1) thereof, and interpreting the terms therein, particularly “person engaged in farming operations” which is not defined in the Section, are applicable to an extent in interpreting the Section. The basis of this is the legislative intent of the Section to pre-empt State laws reflecting that “farm products” exception, as shown in the House Committee Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-271, Part 1, September 13, 1985, at pages 108

      (b) That UCC Section 9-307(1) reads as follows:

      § 205.212   “Buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest.”

#### § § 205.212

      The terms “buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest” are defined in subsections (c) (1) and (7). There are differences between those definitions and the UCC definitions of the same terms. In interpreting those differences, the following would be pertinent:

      (a) The legislative intent discussed above in § 205.211, to pre-empt State laws reflecting the “farm products” exception; and

      (b) The legislative intent shown in subsections (a) and (b) that certain persons take free and clear of certain interests of a “secured lender” “when the seller fails to repay the lender,” unless such persons have information about such interests made available to them as provided in the Section.

      § 205.213   Obligations subject—“person indebted”—“debtor.”

#### § § 205.213

      (a) A debt need not exist at the time of filing of an EFS. The basis for this is that subsection (c)(4) does not require the EFS, and subsection (c)(2)(C) does not require the master list, to show any amount of debt.

      (b) The Section does not provide for the transaction in which one person subjects a product to a security interest for another's debt. However the terms “person indebted” and “debtor” in the Section refer to the person who owns a product and subjects it to a security interest, whether or not that person owes a debt to the secured party. The basis for this is the purpose for which the information is supplied. Any buyer of a farm product, commission merchant, or selling agent querying a master list or system operator about a prospective seller of a farm product is interested in whether that seller has subjected that product to a security interest, not in whether the debt is owed by that seller or by another.

      (c) Security interests existing prior to establishment of a system can be filed in such a system and reflected in the master list if documents are in existence or are created which meet the requirements of subsection (c)(4) besides filing, if such documents are filed wherever State law requires, and if the system operator receives the information about them needed for the master list.

      (d) A system can be in compliance with the Section, although it reflects security interests not supported by EFS's as defined in the legislation, and although it reflects security interests on items other than farm products. However, subsections (e) (2) and (3), and (g)(2) (C) and (D), will apply only as to entries reflecting farm products and supported by EFS's as defined in the Section, and it must be possible to distinguish the entries to which these provisions apply from the other entries.

      § 205.214   Litigation as to whether a system is operating in compliance with the Section.

#### § § 205.214

      (a) The requirements for a system in subsection (c) are written as the definition of the term “central filing system,” so that failure of a system to meet any such requirement, either at the time of its establishment or later, will mean that it is not a “central filing system” as defined.

      (b) The issue whether a system, after certification, is operating in compliance, thus whether it is a “central filing system” as defined, could be litigated and ruled on in a case involving only private parties, such as a lender and a buyer of a farm product. The only immediate effect of a finding in such a case, that a system is not a “central filing system” as defined, would be that the rights of the secured party in the case would be as if the State had no system. However, others would be in doubt as to whether they could safely rely on the same system.

  PART 206—SWINE CONTRACT LIBRARY

### Part 206

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 198-198b; 7 U.S.C. 222.

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 16642, Apr. 2, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

    § 206.1   Definitions.

#### § § 206.1

    The definitions in this section apply to the regulations in this part. The definitions in this section do not apply to other regulations issued under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act) or to the P&S Act as a whole.

    (Synonymous with the term “ledger,” as defined in this section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account. Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.

    The price paid for swine before the application of any premiums or discounts, expressed in dollars per unit.

    A sexually-intact male swine.

    The maximum market price that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price rises above this price.

    Any agreement, whether written or verbal, between a packer and a producer for the purchase of swine for slaughter, except a negotiated purchase (as defined in this section).

    The classification of contracts or risk management agreements for the purchase of swine committed to a packer, by the determination of the base price and the presence or absence of an accrual account or ledger (as defined in this section). The contract type categories are:

    (1) Swine or pork market formula purchases with a ledger,

    (2) Swine or pork market formula purchases without a ledger,

    (3) Other market formula purchases with a ledger,

    (4) Other market formula purchases without a ledger,

    (5) Other purchase arrangements with a ledger, and

    (6) Other purchase arrangements without a ledger.

    The minimum market price that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price falls below this price.

    A price determined by a mathematical formula under which the price established for a specified market serves as the basis for the formula.

    (Synonymous with “accrual account,” as defined in this section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account. Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.

    A purchase, commonly known as a “cash” or “spot market” purchase, of swine by a packer from a producer under which:

    (1) The buyer-seller interaction that results in the transaction and the agreement on actual base price occur on the same day; and

    (2) The swine are scheduled for delivery to the packer not later than 14 days after the date on which the swine are committed to the packer.

    An increase or decrease in the price for the purchase of swine made available by an individual packer or packing plant, based on any factor other than the characteristics of the carcass, if the actual amount of the premium or discount is known before the purchase and delivery of the swine.

    A purchase of swine by a packer in which the pricing determination is a formula price based on any market other than the markets for swine, pork, or a pork product. This includes a formula purchase where the price formula is based on one or more futures or options contracts.

    A purchase of swine by a packer that is not a negotiated purchase, swine or pork market formula purchase, or other market formula purchase, and does not involve packer-owned swine. This contract type includes long term contract agreements, fixed price contracts, cost of production formulas, and formula purchases with a floor, window or ceiling price.

    Any person engaged in the business of buying swine in commerce for purposes of slaughter, of manufacturing or preparing meats or meat food products from swine for sale or shipment in commerce, or of marketing meats or meat food products from swine in an unmanufactured form, acting as a wholesale broker, dealer, or distributor in commerce. The regulations in this part apply only to a packer that meets the conditions in either paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition:

    (1) A packer purchasing at least 100,000 swine per year and slaughtering swine at one or more federally inspected processing plants that meet either of the following conditions:

    (i) A swine processing plant that slaughtered an average of at least 100,000 head of swine per year during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant slaughtered swine; or

    (ii) A swine processing plant that did not slaughter swine during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years that has the capacity to slaughter at least 100,000 swine per year, based on plant capacity information.

    (2) Any packer purchasing an average of at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof, per year and slaughtering at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof at one or more federally inspected processing plants during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant slaughtered swine.

    Any person engaged, either directly or through an intermediary, in the business of selling swine to a packer for slaughter (including the sale of swine from a packer to another packer).

    An adult female swine that has produced one or more litters.

    A porcine animal raised to be a feeder pig, raised for seedstock, or raised for slaughter.

    A purchase of swine by a packer in which the pricing mechanism is a formula price based on a market for swine, pork, or pork product, other than any formula purchase with a floor, window or ceiling price, or a futures or option contract for swine, pork, or a pork product.

    The range of market prices that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market prices fall outside this range. The window price contains both the floor and ceiling prices.

    § 206.2   Swine contract library.

#### § § 206.2

    (a)  Each packer, as defined in § 206.1, must provide information for each swine processing plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1.

    (b)  Each packer must send, to the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD), an example of each contract it currently has with a producer or producers or that is currently available at each plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that meets the definition of packer in § 206.1. This initial submission of example contracts is due to PSD on the first business day of the month following the determination that the plant has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1.

    (c)  After the initial submission, each packer must send PSD an example of each new contract it makes available to a producer or producers within 1 business day of the contract being made available at each plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that meets the definition of packer in § 206.1.

    (d)  For purposes of distinguishing among contracts to determine which contracts may be represented by a single example, contracts will be considered to be the same if they are identical with respect to all of the following four example-contract criteria:

    (1) Base price or determination of base price;

    (2) Application of a ledger or accrual account (including the terms and conditions of the ledger or accrual account provision);

    (3) Carcass merit premium and discount schedules (including the determination of the lean percent or other merits of the carcass that are used to determine the amount of the premiums and discounts and how those premiums and discounts are applied); and

    (4) Use and amount of noncarcass merit premiums and discounts.

    (e)  Each packer may submit the example contracts, notifications required by this section, and Form PSD 342, Contract Submission Cover Sheet, by either of the following two methods:

    (1 Example contracts and notifications required by this section may be submitted by electronic means. Electronic submission may be by any form of electronic transmission that has been determined to be acceptable to the Administrator. To obtain current options for acceptable methods to submit example contracts electronically, contact PSD through the Internet on the AMS website () or at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

    (2)  Each packer that chooses to submit printed example contracts and notifications must deliver the printed contracts and notifications to USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

    (f)  PSD will summarize the information it has received on contract terms, including, but not limited to, base price determination and the schedules of premiums or discounts. PSD will make the information available by region and contract type, as defined in § 206.1, for public release 1 month after the initial submission of contracts. Geographic regions will be defined in such a manner to provide as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with section 251 of the Agricultural Marketing Act (7 U.S.C. 1636).

    (g)  The information will be available on the Internet on the AMS website () and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. The information will be updated as PSD receives information from packers.

    (h)  Each packer must submit a new example contract when contract changes result in changes to any of the four example-contract criteria specified in paragraph (d) of this section and notify PSD if the new example contract replaces the previously submitted example contract. Each packer must notify AMS when an example contract no longer represents any existing or available contract (expired or withdrawn). Each packer must submit these example contracts and notifications within 1 business day of the change, expiration, or withdrawal.

    § 206.3   Monthly report.

#### § § 206.3

    (a)  Each packer, as defined in § 206.1, must provide information for each swine processing plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer.

    (b)  Each packer must send a separate monthly report for each plant that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1. Each packer must deliver the report to the AMS Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa, by the close of business on the 15th of each month, beginning at least 45 days after the initial submission of example contracts. If the 15th day of a month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the monthly report is due no later than the close of the next business day following the 15th.

    (c)  The monthly report that each packer files must be reported on Form PSD 341, which will be available on the Internet on the AMS website () and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. In the monthly report, each packer must provide the following information:

    (1)  Existing contracts are contracts the packer currently is using for the purchase of swine for slaughter at each plant. Each packer must provide monthly estimates of the number of swine committed to be delivered under all of its existing contracts (even if those contracts are not currently available for renewal or to additional producers) in each contract type as defined in § 206.1.

    (2)  Available contracts are the contracts the packer is currently making available to producers, or is making available for renewal to currently contracted producers, for the purchase of swine for slaughter at each plant. On the monthly report, a packer will indicate each contract type, as defined in § 206.1, that the packer is currently making available.

    (3)  Each packer must provide an estimate of the total number of swine committed under existing contracts for delivery to each plant for slaughter within each of the following 12 calendar months beginning with the 1st of the month immediately following the due date of the report. The estimate of total swine committed will be reported by contract type as defined in § 206.1.

    (4)  Any conditions or circumstances specified by clauses in any existing contracts that could result in an increase in the estimates specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Each packer will identify the expansion clauses in the monthly report by listing a code for the following conditions:

    (i) Clauses that allow for a range of the number of swine to be delivered.

    (ii) Clauses that require a greater number of swine to be delivered as the contract continues.

    (iii) Other clauses that provide for expansion in the numbers of swine to be delivered.

    (5)  The packer's estimate of the maximum total number of swine that potentially could be delivered to each plant within each of the following 12 calendar months, if any or all of the types of expansion clauses identified in accordance with the requirement in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are executed. The estimate of maximum potential deliveries must be reported for all existing contracts by contract type as defined in § 206.1.

    (d)  To meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section, the packer must estimate expected and potential deliveries based on the best information available to the packer. Such information might include, for example, the producer's current and projected swine inventories and planned production.

    (e)  Regardless of any estimates for a given future month that may have been previously reported, current estimates of deliveries reported as required by paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section must be based on the most accurate information available at the time each report is prepared.

    (f)  Each packer must submit monthly reports required by this section by either of the following two methods:

    (1)  Information reported under this section may be reported by electronic means, to the maximum extent practicable. Electronic submission may be by any form of electronic transmission that has been determined to be acceptable to the Administrator. To obtain current options for acceptable methods to submit information electronically, contact PSD through the Internet on the AMS website () or at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

    (2)  Each packer may deliver its printed monthly report to USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

    (g)  (1)  PSD will provide a monthly report of estimated deliveries by contract types as reported by packers in accordance with this section, for public release on the first business day of each month. The monthly reports will be available on the Internet on the AMS website () and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

    (2)  Information in the report will be aggregated and reported by geographic regions. Geographic regions will be defined in such a manner to provide as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with section 251 of the Agricultural Marketing Act (7 U.S.C. 1636) and may be modified from time to time.

    (3)  The monthly report will provide the following information:

    (i) The existing contract types for each geographic region.

    (ii) The contract types currently being made available to additional producers or available for renewal to currently contracted producers in each geographic region.

    (iii) The sum of packers' reported estimates of the total number of swine committed by contract for delivery during the next 6 and 12 months beginning with the month the report is published. The report will indicate the number of swine committed by geographic reporting region and by contract type.

    (iv) The types of conditions or circumstances as reported by packers that could result in expansion in the numbers of swine to be delivered under the terms of expansion clauses in the contracts at any time during the following 12 calendar months.

    (v) The sum of packers' reported estimates of the maximum total number of swine that potentially could be delivered during each of the next 6 and 12 months if all expansion clauses in current contracts are executed. The report will indicate the sum of estimated maximum potential deliveries by geographic reporting region and by contract type.

    (h)  The waiver request must be submitted in writing and include a statement that the packer does not procure swine using marketing agreements. The packer must send the waiver request to the PSD Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa. If the waiver request is approved, PSD will inform the packer in writing that it has been granted a waiver for 12 months following the date of receipt of the waiver request unless the status of the packer changes during that year. The packer will be notified to submit the information required in this part if it begins using marketing agreements during the waiver period or if PSD determines that the packer utilizes marketing agreements.
