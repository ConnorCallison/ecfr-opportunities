Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions listed in § 128-1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration. \n\n\n"
