#### § § 413.3

    (a) Settlement lands, which the United States is not under contract to sell or exchange at the time a district makes its annual levy of assessments shall not be assessed, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If the United States thereafter contracts to sell or exchange such lands before the end of the irrigation season following the date of the annual levy, the purchaser will be required to make appropriate payment to the district for the water service which will be available to the purchaser during that irrigation season or the remaining portion thereof.

    (b) From the date the United States contracts to sell or exchange settlement lands until title thereto passes to the purchaser under such contract, or until the rights of the purchaser are terminated or reacquired by the United States settlement lands shall be subject to assessment by a district on the same basis as other lands of like character within the operation of the district.

    (c) Settlement lands, which the United States is not under contract to sell or exchange at the time a district makes its levy may be assessed by a district to the extent of the construction charge obligation installment required to be levied for the following year on such lands on account of the district's construction cost obligation to the United States. No other levies shall be made by a district against settlement lands in this status.

    (d) While settlement lands which the United States has leased for use as irrigated lands and which the United States has not contracted to sell or exchange may not be assessed by a district except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, lessees shall pay the district the same amounts annually that would be required to be paid for water service if the lands were subject to assessment therefor, in addition to any assessment levied under paragraph (c) of this section.

    (e) Assessments made by a district against settlement lands while the United States is under contract to sell or exchange such lands shall be subject to all interest and penalties for delinquency as provided by the laws of Washington, but interest and penalties shall cease to accumulate on the date such contract is terminated or the purchaser's interest therein reacquired by the United States.

    (f) No action shall be taken by or for a district to enforce any lien created as permitted under the regulations in this part by assessment foreclosure or other means that would purport to transfer any right in or title to any land or interests therein while title thereto is vested in the United States. Although the United States does not assume any obligation for the payment of such liens, it will in any conveyance of settlement lands covered thereby convey subject to those liens.

    § 413.4   Assessment of other project act lands and rights of way.

#### § § 413.4

    (a) A district shall, as to other project act lands and rights of way the title to which passes to the United States on or after January 1 of any year and before the district has levied its assessments for that year, immediately remove the lands from its assessment rolls and shall not thereafter take any proceedings to complete or enforce the assessments. Any such removal from the rolls shall be effective as of January 1 of the year in which title passes to the United States Action so to remove shall be taken promptly after the giving of written notice by the Project Manager to the district as to the lands involved, and the district shall provide the United States with a certificate stating that the lands have not been and will not be assessed so long as title thereto remains in the United States.

    (b) There is no authority in law for the assessment of rights of way owned by the United States. Accordingly, a district shall make no assessment thereof while title thereto remains in the United States.

    (c) Other project act lands while title thereto remains in the United States shall not be assessed for any district charge so long as they are in the “other project act lands” category.

    § 413.5   Reports on status of settlement lands.

#### § § 413.5

    The Project Manager will furnish each district prior to its annual levy every year a list of all the settlement lands owned by the United States for which water is available and which are not under contract of sale or exchange and therefore are not to be assessed by the district, except for construction charge obligation installments under § 413.3(c) when such charges are required to be levied.

    Subpart B—Storage and Interstate Release Agreements

      § 414.3   Storage and Interstate Release Agreements.

#### § § 414.3

      (a)  Two or more authorized entities may enter into Storage and Interstate Release Agreements with the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Each agreement must meet all of the requirements of this section.

      (1) The agreement must specify the quantity of Colorado River water to be stored, the Lower Division State in which it is to be stored, the entity(ies) that will store the water, and the facility(ies) in which it will be stored.

      (2) The agreement must specify whether the water to be stored will be within the unused basic apportionment or unused surplus apportionment of the Storing State. For water from the Storing State's apportionment to qualify as unused apportionment available for storage under this part, the water must first be offered to all entitlement holders within the Storing State for purposes other than interstate transactions under proposed Storage and Interstate Release Agreements.

      (3) The agreement must specify whether the water to be stored will be within the unused basic apportionment or unused surplus apportionment of the Consuming State. If the water to be stored will be unused apportionment of the Consuming State, the agreement must acknowledge that any unused apportionment of the Consuming State may be made available from the Consuming State by the Secretary to the Storing State only in accordance with Article II(B)(6) of the Decree. If unused apportionment from the Consuming State is to be stored under a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement, the Secretary will make the unused apportionment of the Consuming State available to the storing entity in accordance with the terms of a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement and will not make that water available to other entitlement holders.

      (4) The agreement must specify the maximum quantity of ICUA that will be developed and made available for release to the consuming entity.

      (5) The agreement must specify that ICUA may not be requested by the consuming entity in a quantity that exceeds the quantity of water that had been stored under a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement in the Storing State.

      (6) The agreement must specify a procedure to verify and account for the quantity of water stored in the Storing State under a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.

      (7) The agreement must specify that, by a date certain, the consuming entity will:

      (i) Notify the storing entity to develop a specific quantity of ICUA in the following calendar year;

      (ii) Ask the Secretary to release that ICUA; and

      (iii) Provide a copy of the notice or request to each Lower Division State.

      (8) The agreement must specify that when the storing entity receives a request to develop a specific quantity of ICUA:

      (i) It will ensure that the Storing State's consumptive use of Colorado River water will be decreased by a quantity sufficient to develop the requested quantity of ICUA; and

      (ii) Any actions that the storing entity takes will be consistent with its State's laws.

      (9) The agreement must include a description of:

      (i) The actions the authorized entity will take to develop ICUA;

      (ii) Potential actions to decrease the authorized entity's consumptive use of Colorado River water;

      (iii) The means by which the development of the ICUA will be enforceable by the storing entity; and

      (iv) The notice given to entitlement holders, including Indian tribes, of opportunities to participate in development of this ICUA.

      (10) The agreement must specify that the storing entity will certify to the Secretary that ICUA has been or will be developed that otherwise would not have existed. The certification must:

      (i) Identify the quantity, the means, and the entity by which ICUA has been or will be developed; and

      (ii) Ask the Secretary to make the ICUA available to the consuming entity under Article II(B)(6) of the Decree and the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.

      (11) The agreement must specify a procedure for verifying development of the ICUA appropriate to the manner in which it is developed.

      (12) The agreement must specify that the Secretary will release ICUA developed by the storing entity:

      (i) In accordance with a request of the consuming entity;

      (ii) In accordance with the terms of the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement;

      (iii) Only for use by the consuming entity and not for use by other entitlement holders; and

      (iv) In accordance with the terms of the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement, the BCPA, Article II(B)(6) of the Decree and all other applicable laws and executive orders.

      (13) The agreement must specify that ICUA shall be released to the consuming entity only in the year and to the extent that ICUA is developed by the storing entity by reducing Colorado River water use within the Storing State.

      (14) The agreement must specify that the Secretary will release ICUA only after the Secretary has determined that all necessary actions have been taken under this part.

      (15) The agreement must specify that before releasing ICUA the Secretary must first determine that the storing entity:

      (i) Stored water in accordance with the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement in quantities sufficient to support the development of the ICUA requested by the consuming entity; and

      (ii) Certified to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the quantity of ICUA requested by the consuming entity has been developed in that year or will be developed in that year under § 414.3(f).

      (16) The agreement must specify that the non-Federal parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement will indemnify the United States, its employees, agents, subcontractors, successors, or assigns from loss or claim for damages and from liability to persons or property, direct or indirect, and loss or claim of any nature whatsoever arising by reason of the actions taken by the non-federal parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement under this part.

      (17) The agreement must specify the extent to which facilities constructed or financed by the United States will be used to store, convey, or distribute water associated with a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.

      (18) The agreement must include any other provisions that the parties deem appropriate.

      (b)  The Secretary will not execute an agreement that has adverse impacts on the financial interests of the United States. Financial details between and among the non-Federal parties need not be included in the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement but instead can be the subject of separate agreements. The Secretary need not be a party to the separate agreements.

      (c)  The Regional Director for the Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region (Regional Director) may execute and administer a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement on behalf of the Secretary. The Secretary will notify the public of his/her intent to participate in negotiations to develop a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement and provide a means for public input. In considering whether to execute a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement, the Secretary may request, and the non-Federal parties must provide, any additional supporting data necessary to clearly set forth both the details of the proposed transaction and the eligibility of the parties to participate as State-authorized entities in the proposed transaction. The Secretary will also consider: applicable law and executive orders; applicable contracts; potential effects on trust resources; potential effects on entitlement holders, including Indian tribes; potential impacts on the Upper Division States; potential effects on third parties; potential environmental impacts and potential effects on threatened and endangered species; comments from interested parties, particularly parties who may be affected by the proposed action; comments from the State agencies responsible for consulting with the Secretary on matters related to the Colorado River; and other relevant factors, including the direct or indirect consequences of the proposed Storage and Interstate Release Agreement on the financial interests of the United States. Based on the consideration of the factors in this section, the Secretary may execute or decide not to execute a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.

      (d)  Non-Federal parties to a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement may assign their interests in the Agreement to authorized entities. The assignment can be in whole or in part. The assignment can only be made if all parties to the agreement approve.

      (e)  Release or diversion of Colorado River water for storage under this part must be supported by a water delivery contract with the Secretary in accordance with Section 5 of the BCPA. The only exception to this requirement is storage of Article II(D) (of the Decree) water by Federal or tribal entitlement holders. The release or diversion of Colorado River water that has been developed or will be developed as ICUA under this part also must be supported by a Section 5 water delivery contract.

      (1) An authorized entity may satisfy the requirement of this section through a direct contract with the Secretary. An authorized entity also may satisfy the Section 5 requirement of the BCPA, for purposes of this part, through a valid subcontract with an entitlement holder that is authorized by the Secretary to subcontract for the delivery of all or a portion of its entitlement.

      (2) For storing entities that do not otherwise hold a contract or valid subcontract for the delivery of the water to be stored, the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement will serve as the vehicle for satisfying the Section 5 requirement for the release or diversion of that water.

      (3) For consuming entities that do not otherwise hold a contract or valid subcontract for the delivery of the water to be released by the Secretary as ICUA, the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement will serve as the vehicle for satisfying the Section 5 requirement for the release or diversion of that water.

      (f)  The Secretary may release ICUA to a consuming entity before the actual development of ICUA by the storing entity if the storing entity certifies to the Secretary that ICUA will be developed during that same year that otherwise would not have existed.

      (1) These anticipatory releases will only be made in the same year that the ICUA is developed.

      (2) Before an anticipatory release, the Secretary must be satisfied that the storing entity will develop the necessary ICUA in the same year that the ICUA is to be released.

      (g)  Prior to executing any specific Storage and Interstate Release Agreements, the United States will consult with Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission under the boundary water treaties and other applicable international agreements in force between the two countries.

      § 414.4   Reporting requirements and accounting under Storage and Interstate Release Agreements.

#### § § 414.4

      (a)  Each storing entity will submit an annual report to the Secretary containing the material required by this section. The report will be due on a date to be agreed upon by the parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement. The report must include:

      (1) The quantity of water diverted and stored during the prior year under all Storage and Interstate Release Agreements; and

      (2) The total quantity of stored water available to support the development of ICUA under each Storage and Interstate Release Agreement to which the storing entity is a party as of December 31 of the prior calendar year.

      (b)  The Secretary will account for water diverted and stored under Storage and Interstate Release Agreements in the records maintained under Article V of the Decree.

      (1) The Secretary will account for the water that is diverted and stored by a storing entity as a consumptive use in the Storing State for the year in which it is stored.

      (2) The Secretary will account for the diversion and consumptive use of ICUA by a consuming entity as a consumptive use in the Consuming State of unused apportionment under Article II(B)(6) of the Decree in the year the water is released in the same manner as any other unused apportionment taken by that State.

      (3) The Secretary will maintain individual balances of the quantities of water stored under a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement and available to support the development of ICUA. The appropriate balances will be reduced when ICUA is developed by the storing entity and released by the Secretary for use by a consuming entity.

    Subpart C—Water Quality and Environmental Compliance

      § 414.5   Water quality.

#### § § 414.5

      (a)  The Secretary does not warrant the quality of water released or delivered under Storage and Interstate Release Agreements, and the United States will not be liable for damages of any kind resulting from water quality problems. The United States is not under any obligation to construct or furnish water treatment facilities to maintain or improve water quality except as may otherwise be provided in relevant Federal law.

      (b)  All entities, in diverting, using, and returning Colorado River water, must:

      (1) Comply with all applicable water pollution laws and regulations of the United States, the Storing State, and the Consuming State; and

      (2) Obtain all applicable permits or licenses from the appropriate Federal, State, or local authorities regarding water quality and water pollution matters.

      § 414.6   Environmental compliance and funding of Federal costs.

#### § § 414.6

      (a)  The Secretary will complete environmental compliance documentation, compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended; and will integrate the requirements of other statutes, laws, and executive orders as required for Federal actions to be taken under this part.

      (b)  Authorized entities seeking to enter into a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement under this part may prepare the appropriate documentation and compliance document for a proposed Federal action, such as execution of a proposed Storage and Interstate Release Agreement. The compliance documents must meet the standards set forth in Reclamation's national environmental policy guidance before they can be adopted.

      (c)  All costs incurred by the United States in evaluating, processing, and/or executing a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement under this part must be funded in advance by the authorized entities that are party to that agreement.

California et al.”, 376 U.S. 340 (for purposes of this part each such Federal establishment is considered as a “Contractor”), except that (a) neither this part nor the term “Contractor” as used herein shall apply to any person or entity which has a contract for the delivery or use of Colorado River water made pursuant to the Warren Act of February 21, 1911 (36 Stat. 925) or the Miscellaneous Purposes Act of February 25, 1920 (41 Stat. 451), (b) Contractors and permittees for small quantities of water, as determined by the Regional Director, Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City, Nev. (herein termed “Regional Director”), and Contractors for municipal and industrial water may be excluded from the application of these procedures at the discretion of the Regional Director, and (c) procedural methods for implementing Colorado River water conservation measures on Indian Reservations will be in accordance with § 417.5 of this part.

    § 417.2   Consultation with contractors.

#### § § 417.2

    The Regional Director or his representative will, prior to the beginning of each calendar year, arrange for and conduct such consultations with each Contractor as the Regional Director may deem appropriate as to the making by the Regional Director of annual recommendations relating to water conservation measures and operating practices in the diversion, delivery, distribution and use of Colorado River water, and to the making by the Regional Director of annual determinations of each Contractor's estimated water requirements for the ensuing calendar year to the end that deliveries of Colorado River water to each Contractor will not exceed those reasonably required for beneficial use under the respective Boulder Canyon Project Act contract or other authorization for use of Colorado River water.

    § 417.3   Notice of recommendations and determinations.

#### § § 417.3

    Following consultation with each Contractor and after consideration of all relevant comments and suggestions advanced by the Contractors in such consultations, the Regional Director will formulate his recommendations and determinations relating to the matters specified in § 417.2. The recommendations and determinations shall, with respect to each Contractor, be based upon but not necessarily limited to such factors as the area to be irrigated, climatic conditions, location, land classifications, the kinds of crops raised, cropping practices, the type of irrigation system in use, the condition of water carriage and distribution facilities, record of water orders, and rejections of ordered water, general operating practices, the operating efficiencies and methods of irrigation of the water users, amount and rate of return flows to the river, municipal water requirements and the pertinent provisions of the Contractor's Boulder Canyon Project Act water delivery contract. The Regional Director shall give each Contractor written notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of his recommendations and determinations. If the recommendations and determinations include a reduction in the amount of water to be delivered, as compared to the calendar year immediately preceding, the notice shall be delivered to the Contractor or timely sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, so that it may reasonably be delivered at least 30 days prior to the first date water delivery would be affected thereby, and shall specify the basis for such reduction including any pertinent factual determinations. The recommendations and determinations of the Regional Director shall be final and conclusive unless, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the Contractor submits his written comments and objections to the Regional Director and requests further consultation. If, after such further consultation, timely taken, the Regional Director does not modify his recommendations and determinations and so advises the Contractor in writing, or if modifications are made but the Contractor still feels aggrieved thereby after notification in writing of such modified recommendations and determinations, the Contractor may, before 30 days after receipt of said notice, appeal to the Secretary of the Interior. During the pendency of such appeal, and until disposition thereof by the Secretary, the recommendations and determinations formulated by the Regional Director shall be of no force or effect. In the event delivery of water is scheduled prior to the new recommendations and determinations becoming final, said delivery shall be made according to the Contractor's currently proposed schedule or to the schedules approved for the previous calendar year, whichever is less.

    § 417.4   Changed conditions, emergency, or hardship modifications.

#### § § 417.4

    A Contractor may at any time apply in writing to the Regional Director for modification of recommendations or determinations deemed necessary because of changed conditions, emergency, or hardship. Upon receipt of such written application identifying the reason for such requested modification, the Regional Director shall arrange for consultation with the Contractor with the objective of making such modifications as he may deem appropriate under the then existing conditions. The Regional Director may initiate efforts for further consultation with any Contractor on his own motion with the objective of modifying previous recommendations and determinations, but in the event such modifications are made, the Contractor shall have the same opportunity to object and appeal as provided in § 417.3 of this part for the initial recommendations and determinations. The Regional Director shall afford the fullest practicable opportunity for consultation with a Contractor when acting under this section. Each modification under this section shall be transmitted to the Contractor by letter.

    § 417.5   Duties of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with respect to Indian reservations.

#### § § 417.5

    (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs (herein termed “Commissioner”) will engage in consultations with various tribes and other water users on the Indian Reservations listed in Article II (D) of said Supreme Court Decree, similar to those engaged in by the Regional Director with regard to Contractors as provided in § 417.2 of this part. After consideration of all comments and suggestions advanced by said tribes and other water users on said Indian Reservations concerning water conservation measures and operating practices in the diversion, delivery, distribution and use of Colorado River water, the Commissioner shall, within the limits prescribed in said decree, make a determination as to the estimated amount of water to be diverted for use on each Indian Reservation covered by the above decree. Said determination shall be made prior to the beginning of each calendar year. That determination shall be based upon, but not necessarily limited to, such factors as: The area to be irrigated, climatic conditions, location, land classifications, the kinds of crops raised, cropping practices, the type of irrigation system in use, the condition of water carriage and distribution facilities, record of water orders, and rejections of ordered water, general operating practices, the operating efficiencies and methods of irrigation of the tribes and water users on each reservation, the amount and rate of return flows to the river, municipal water requirements, and other uses on the reservation. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall deliver to the Regional Director written notice of the amount of water to be diverted for use upon each Indian Reservation for each year 60 days prior to the beginning of each calendar year and the basis for said determination. The determination of the Commissioner shall be final and conclusive unless within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice the Regional Director submits his written comments and objections to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and requests further consultation. If after such further consultation, timely taken, the Commissioner does not modify his determination and so advises the Regional Director in writing or if modifications are made by the Commissioner but the Regional Director still does not agree therewith, the Regional Director may, within 30 days after receipt of the Commissioner's response, appeal to the Secretary of the Interior for a decision on the matter. During the pendency of such appeal and until disposition thereof by the Secretary, water deliveries will be made to the extent legally and physically available according to the Commissioner's determination or according to the Commissioner's determination for the preceding calendar year, whichever is less.

    (b) Modifications of said determinations due to changed conditions, emergency or hardship may be made by the Commissioner, subject, however, to the right of the Regional Director to appeal to the Secretary, as provided in the case of an initial determination by the Commissioner. During the pendency of such an appeal, water deliveries will be made on the basis of the initial determination.

    § 417.6   General regulations.

#### § § 417.6

    In addition to the recommendations and determinations formulated according to the procedures set out above, the right is reserved to issue regulations of general applicability to the topics dealt with herein.

    Conditions of Water Delivery

      § 418.7   Who may receive irrigation deliveries.

#### § § 418.7

      Project irrigation water deliveries may be made only to eligible land to be irrigated. The District must maintain records for each individual water right holder indicating the number of eligible acres irrigated and the amount of water ordered and delivered.

      § 418.8   Types of eligible land.

#### § § 418.8

      (a)  During each year, the District, in cooperation with the Bureau, must identify and report to the Bureau the location and number of acres of eligible land irrigated in the Project. Possible irrigation of ineligible land will also be identified. The Bureau will review data to ensure compliance with this part. The District, in cooperation with the Bureau, will be responsible for field checking potential violations and immediately stopping delivery of Project water to any ineligible land. The Bureau may also audit as appropriate.

      (b)  The District water rights maps dated August 1981 through January 1983 will be used as the basis for determining which lands have a valid water right. The original maps will be maintained by the District. The District must provide copies of the maps to the Bureau. The District will alter the maps and the copies to account for water right transfers as the transfers are approved by the Nevada State Engineer.

      (c)  The Bureau will also identify eligible land that was not irrigated during the prior irrigation season.

      § 418.9   Reporting changes in eligible land.

#### § § 418.9

      (a)  (1) Anticipated changes in irrigated eligible land from the prior year will be reported to the Bureau's Lahontan Area Office by the District by March 1 of each year. The District will adjust the acreage of the eligible land anticipated to be irrigated to correct for inaccuracies, water right transfers that have been finally approved by the Nevada State Engineer, and any other action that affects the number of eligible acres, acres anticipated to be irrigated, or water deliveries.

      (2) As the adjustments are made, the District will provide updated information to the Bureau for review and approval. The District must adjust anticipated water allocations to individual water users accordingly. The allocations will at all times be based on a maximum annual entitlement of 3.5 acre-feet (AF) per acre of bottom land, 4.5 AF per acre of bench land, and 1.5 AF per acre of pasture land that is anticipated to be irrigated and not on the number of water-righted acres.

      (3) The District will provide the individual water users with the approved data regarding the anticipated acreage to be irrigated and water allocations for each water user that year.

      (i) Any adjustments based on changes in lands anticipated to be irrigated during the irrigation season must be reported by the individual water user to the District.

      (ii) The District will, in turn, notify the Bureau of any changes in irrigated acreage which must be accounted for.

      (iii) Each landowner's anticipated acreage must be less than or equal to the landowner's eligible acreage.

      (4) Should a landowner believe that the number of acres of eligible land he or she is entitled to irrigate is different from the number of acres as approved by the Bureau, the landowner must notify the District and present appropriate documentation regarding the subject acreage. The District must record the information and present the claim to the Bureau for further consideration.

      (i) If the Bureau determines there is sufficient support for the landowner's claim, then adjustments will be made to accommodate the changes requested by the landowner.

      (ii) If the Bureau disallows the landowner's claim, the Bureau must notify the District in writing. The District will, in turn, inform the landowner of the disposition of the claim and the reasons therefore, and will further instruct the landowner that he or she may seek judicial review of the Bureau's determination under the decrees. If the dispute affects the current year, then the Bureau and the District will seek to expedite any court proceeding.

      (b)  By March 1 of each year, the District must report to the Bureau all anticipated domestic and other water uses. This notification must include a detailed explanation of the criteria used in allowing the use and sufficient documentation on the type and amount of use by each water user to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Bureau that each water user is in compliance with the criteria. With adequate documentation, the District may notify the Bureau of any changes in domestic water requirements at any time during the year.

      § 418.10   Determining the amount of water duty to be delivered.

#### § § 418.10

      (a) Eligible land may receive no more than the amount of water in acre-feet per year established as maximum farm headgate delivery allowances by the decrees. All water use is limited to that amount reasonably necessary for economical and beneficial use under the decrees.

      (b) The annual water duty as assigned by the decrees is a maximum of 4.5 AF per acre for bench lands and a maximum of 3.5 AF per acre for bottom lands. The water duty for fields with a mixture of bench and bottom lands must be the water duty of the majority acreage. Bench and bottom land designations as finally approved by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada will be used in determining the maximum water duty for any parcel of eligible land. The annual water duty for pasture land established by contract is 1.5 AF per acre.

      § 418.11   Valid headgate deliveries.

#### § § 418.11

      The valid water deliveries at the headgate are set by the product of eligible land actually irrigated multiplied by the appropriate water duty in accordance with §§ 418.8 and 418.10. The District will regularly monitor all water deliveries and report in accordance with § 418.9. No amount of water will be delivered in excess of the individual water user's headgate entitlement. In the event excess deliveries should occur, such amount will be automatically reflected in the efficiency deficit adjustment to the Lahontan storage. Water delivered in excess of entitlements must not be considered valid for purposes of computing project efficiency.

      § 418.12   Project efficiency.

#### § § 418.12

      (a) The principal feature of this part is to obtain a reasonable level of efficiency in supplying water to the headgate by the District. The efficiency targets established by this part are the cornerstone of the enforcement and the incentive provisions and when implemented will aid other competing uses.

      (b) The efficiency is readily calculable at the year's end, readily applicable to water appropriate to that year, able to be compared to other irrigation systems even though there may be many dissimilarities, appropriate for long term averaging, adjustable to any headgate delivery level including droughts or allocations, automatically adjusts to changes during the year and accurately accounts for misappropriated water. Efficiency also can be achieved through any number of measures from operations to changes in the facilities and can be measured as an end product without regard to the approach. Thus it is flexible enough to allow local decision making and yet is fact based to minimize disputes.

      (c) Assuming the headgate deliveries are valid and enforceable, conveyance efficiency is the only remaining variable in determining the quantity of water needed to be supplied to the District. Conveyance efficiency is a measure of how much water is released into the irrigation system relative to actual headgate deliveries. Differences in efficiency, therefore, are directly convertible to acre-feet. The differences in efficiency, expressed as a quantity in acre-feet, may be added to or subtracted from the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level before it is compared to the monthly storage objective. Thus, the diversions from the Truckee River, operation of other facilities (e.g., Stampede Reservoir) and decisions related to Lahontan Reservoir are made after the efficiency storage adjustments have been made. Operating decisions are made as if the adjusted storage reflected actual conditions.

      (1)  In any year that the District's actual efficiency exceeds the target efficiency for the actual headgate delivery, two-thirds of the resultant savings, in water, will be credited to the District as storage in Lahontan. This storage amount will remain in Lahontan Reservoir as water available to the District to use at its discretion consistent with Nevada and Federal law. Such uses may include wetlands (directly or incidentally), power production, recreation, a hedge against future shortages or whatever else the District determines. The storage is credited at the end of the irrigation season from which it was earned. This storage “floats” on top of the reservoir so that if it is unused it will be spilled first if the reservoir spills. The District may use all capacity of Lahontan Reservoir not needed for project purposes to store credits.

      (2)  In any year that the District's actual efficiency falls short of the target appropriate to the actual headgate deliveries, then the resultant excess water that was used is considered borrowed from the future. Thus it becomes a storage debit adjustment to the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level for determining all operational decisions. The debit may accumulate but may not exceed a maximum as defined in § 418.13(b). The debit must be offset by an existing incentive credit or, if none is available, by a subsequent incentive at a full credit (not a   credit), or finally by a restriction of actual headgate deliveries by the District. This would only be done prospectively (a subsequent year) so the District and the water users can prepare accordingly. Since the debit does not immediately affect other competing uses or the District (except in a real drought), it allows for future planning and averaging over time.

      (3)  To determine the efficiency target, the system delivery losses were divided into categories such as seepage, evaporation and operational losses. The “reasonable” level of savings for each category was then determined by starting with current operating experience and applying the added knowledge from several measures. Means of achieving the efficiency targets, including the specific conservation measures and amounts, are identified in the table Possible Water Conservation Measures for the Newlands Project. Applicable target efficiencies will be determined each year as described in § 418.13 (a)(4).

      (4)  The water conservation measures referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and others currently available to the District are listed in the following table. The table has been revised based upon the Bureau of Reclamation's Final Report to Congress of the Newlands Project Efficiency Study, 1994.

      (5) The measures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are discretionary choices for the District. The range of measures available to the District provides a level of assurance that the target efficiency is reasonably achievable. The resultant efficiency targets were also compared to the range of efficiencies actually experienced by other irrigation systems that were considered comparable in order to provide a further check on “reasonable.” Most of the delivery losses are relatively constant regardless of the amount of deliveries. The efficiency will necessarily vary with the amount of headgate deliveries.

      (6) The target efficiency for any annual valid headgate delivery can be derived from the table in Appendix A to this part.

      § 418.13   Maximum allowable limits.

#### § § 418.13

      (a)  (1) A provisional water budget in the Newlands Project Water Budget table must be recalculated for each irrigation season to reflect anticipated water-righted acres to be irrigated. At the start of the irrigation season, the maximum allowable diversion (MAD) for each year must be determined by revising the first 10 lines of the Newlands Project Water Budget table based on acres of eligible land anticipated to actually be irrigated in that year (§ 418.9(a)) and the water duties for those lands (§ 418.10). At the end of the irrigation season, the required target efficiency must be recalculated for the irrigation season based on the actual irrigated acres and percent use of headgate entitlements.

      (2) The MAD will be calculated annually to ensure an adequate water supply for all water right holders whose water use complies with their decreed entitlement and this part. The MAD is the maximum amount of water permitted to be diverted for irrigation use on the Project in that year. It is calculated to ensure full entitlements can be provided, but is expected to significantly exceed Project requirements. The MAD will be established by the Bureau at least 2 weeks before the start of each irrigation season. All releases of water from Lahontan Reservoir and diversions from the Truckee Canal (including any diversions from the Truckee Canal to Rock Dam Ditch) must be charged to the MAD except as provided in §§ 418.23 and 418.35 of this part.

      (3) On the basis of the methodology adopted in this part (i.e., actual irrigated acres multiplied by appropriate water duties divided by established project efficiency) an example of the MAD calculated for the projected irrigated acreage as shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table would be 308,319 acre-feet for the 1995 Example. The sample MAD corresponds to a system efficiency for full deliveries at 66.9 percent for 1995 actual acres. Target efficiencies must be based on the percentage of maximum headgate entitlement delivered and not on the percent of water supply available.

      (4) The table Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency shows the target efficiencies which will be used over the range of irrigated acreage and percent use of entitlement expected in the future. At the beginning of the irrigation season, the target efficiencies from the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table used to calculate the MAD will be based on the expected irrigated acreage and expected percent use of entitlement. At the end of the irrigation season, the actual acreage irrigated and actual percent use of entitlement will be used to determine the required efficiency from the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency. The target efficiencies are read directly from the table if the acreage and use of entitlement values are shown, otherwise the target efficiency must be extrapolated from the table or calculated using the Efficiency Equation. Appendix A of this part shows the calculations used to derive the Efficiency Equation and the efficiency targets.

      (5) Adjustments in the MAD must be made by the Bureau each year based on changes in irrigated eligible land from the prior year and subsequent decisions concerning transfers of Project water rights, using the methodology established in this section.

      (6) If the MAD for a given year will not meet the water delivery requirements for the eligible land to be irrigated due to weather conditions, canal breaks, or some other unusual or unforeseen condition, the District must ask the Bureau for additional water.

      (i) The District's request must include a written statement containing a detailed explanation of the reasons for the request.

      (ii) The Bureau must promptly review the request and after consultation with the Federal Water Master and other interested parties, will determine if the request or any portion of it should be approved. The Bureau will make reasonable adjustments for unforeseen causes or events but will not make adjustments to accommodate waste or Project inefficiency or other uses of water not in accordance with this part or with State and Federal law.

      (iii) The Bureau will then notify the District of its determination. If the District does not agree with the Bureau's decision, it may seek judicial review. The Bureau and the District will seek to expedite the court proceeding in order to minimize any potential adverse effects.

      (b)  The debits in Lahontan Reservoir storage from the District's actual conveyance efficiency not achieving the target efficiency can accumulate over time. If these amounts of borrowed storage get too large they may not be offset later by increased efficiencies and may severely affect the District's water users by imposing an added “drought” on top of a real one. Therefore, the maximum efficiency debit cushion is set at 26,000 acre-feet. However, unlike the MAD, it only applies to the subsequent year's operation. The MED is approximately 9 percent of the headgate entitlements.

    Monitoring Diversions

      § 418.14   Recordkeeping requirements.

#### § § 418.14

      (a) By the end of each month, the District must submit to the Bureau's Lahontan Area Office reports for the previous month which document monthly inflow and outflow in acre-feet from the Truckee and Carson divisions of the Project for that month. Reports must include any data the Bureau may reasonably require to monitor compliance with this part.

      (b) Accounting for farm headgate deliveries must be based on the amount of water actually delivered to the water user. Project operations must provide for the amount of water ordered and the distribution system losses.

      (c) The District must keep records of all domestic and other water uses showing the purpose and amount of water usage for each entity. The District must make the records available for review by the Bureau upon request. The Bureau may audit all records kept by the District.

      § 418.15   Operations monitoring.

#### § § 418.15

      (a) The Bureau will work with the District to monitor Project operations and will perform field inspections of water distribution during the irrigation season.

      (1) Staff members of the Bureau's Lahontan Area Office and the District will meet as often as necessary during the irrigation season after each water distribution report has been prepared to examine the amounts of water used to that point in the season.

      (2) On the basis of the information obtained from field observations, water use records, and consultations with District staff, the Bureau will determine at monthly intervals whether the rate of diversion is consistent with this part for that year.

      (3) The District will be informed in writing of suggested adjustments that may be made in management of diversions and releases as necessary to achieve target efficiencies and stay within the MAD.

      (b) Project operations will be monitored in part by measuring flows at key locations. Specifically, Project diversions (used in the calculations under § 418.18 below) will be determined by:

      (1) Adding flows measured at:

      (i) Truckee Canal near Wadsworth—U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauge number 10351300;

      (ii) Carson River below Lahontan Dam—USGS gauge number 10312150;

      (iii) Rock Dam Ditch near the end of the concrete lining; and

      (2) Subtracting:

      (i) Flows measured at the Truckee Canal near Hazen—USGS gauge number 10351400;

      (ii) The Carson River at Tarzyn Road near Fallon (below Sagouspe Dam) for satisfying water rights outside of the Project boundaries as described in § 418.25, USGS gauge number 10312275;

      (iii) Estimated losses in the Truckee Canal; and

      (iv) Spills, precautionary drawdown, and incentive water released at Lahontan Dam under §§ 418.24 and 418.36.

    Operations and Management

      § 418.16   Using water for power generation.

#### § § 418.16

      All use of Project water for power generation must be incidental to releases charged against Project diversions, precautionary drawdown, incentive water (§ 418.35), or spills.

      § 418.17   Truckee and Carson River water use.

#### § § 418.17

      Project water must be managed to make maximum use of Carson River water and to minimize diversions of Truckee River water through the Truckee Canal. This will make available as much Truckee River water as possible for use in the lower Truckee River and Pyramid Lake.

      § 418.18   Diversions at Derby Dam.

#### § § 418.18

      (a) Diversions of Truckee River water at Derby Dam must be managed to maintain minimum terminal flow to Lahontan Reservoir or the Carson River except where this part specifically permits diversions.

      (b) Diversions to the Truckee Canal must be managed to achieve an average terminal flow of 20 cfs or less during times when diversions to Lahontan Reservoir are not allowed (the flows must be averaged over the total time diversions are not allowed in that calendar year; i.e., if flows are not allowed in July and August and then are allowed in September then not allowed in October and November, the average flow will be averaged over the four months of July, August, October, and November).

      (c) The Bureau will work cooperatively with the District on monitoring the flows at the USGS gage on the Truckee Canal near Hazen to determine if and when flows are in excess of those needed in accord with this part and bringing the flows back into compliance when excessive.

      (d) Increases in canal diversions which would reduce Truckee River flows below Derby Dam by more than 20 percent in a 24-hour period will not be allowed when Truckee River flow, as measured by the gauge below Derby Dam, is less than or equal to 100 cfs.

      (e) Diversions to the Truckee Canal will be coordinated with releases from Stampede Reservoir and other reservoirs, in cooperation with the Federal Water Master, to minimize fluctuations in the Truckee River below Derby Dam in order to meet annual flow regimes established by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for listed species in the lower Truckee River.

      § 418.19   Diversions from the Truckee River to the Truckee Division.

#### § § 418.19

      Sufficient water, if available, will be diverted from the Truckee River through the Truckee Canal to meet the direct irrigation, domestic and other entitlements of the Truckee Division.

      § 418.20   Diversions from the Truckee River to Lahontan Reservoir, January through June.

#### § § 418.20

      (a) Truckee River diversions through the Truckee Canal will be made to meet Lahontan Reservoir end-of-month storage objectives for the months of January through June. The current month storage objective will be based, in part, on the monthly Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) April through July runoff forecast for the Carson River near Fort Churchill. The forecast will be used to determine the target storage for Lahontan Reservoir and anticipated diversion requirements for the Carson Division. The Bureau, in consultation with the District, Federal Water Master, Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, and other affected parties, will determine the exceedance levels and predicted Carson River inflows based on the reliability of the NRCS forecast and other available information such as river forecasts from other sources. The end-of-month storage objectives may be adjusted any time during the month as new forecasts or other information become available.

      (b) The January through June storage objective will be calculated using the following formula:

      (c) The Lahontan Reservoir storage objective for each month is contained in the following table.

      (d) Once the monthly Lahontan Reservoir storage objective has been determined, the monthly diversion to the Project from the Truckee River will be based upon water availability and Project demand as expressed in the following relationship:

      (e) The following procedure is intended to ensure that monthly storage objectives are not exceeded. It may be implemented only if the following conditions are met:

      (1) Diversions from the Truckee River are required to achieve the current month Lahontan Reservoir storage objective (LSOCM);

      (2) Truckee River runoff above Derby Dam is available for diversion to Lahontan Reservoir;

      (3) Sufficient Stampede Reservoir storage capacity is available.

      (f) The Bureau, in consultation with the Federal Water Master, the District, Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe will determine whether the calculated current month Truckee River diversion to Lahontan Reservoir (TRD-TDD-TCL) may be reduced during that month and the amount of reduction credit stored in Stampede Reservoir.

      (1) Reductions in diversions may begin in November and continue until the end of June.

      (2) Reductions in diversions to Lahontan Reservoir with credit storage in Stampede Reservoir may be implemented to the extent that:

      (i) The reduction is in lieu of a scheduled release from Stampede Reservoir for the purpose of supplementing flows to Pyramid Lake; and/or

      (ii) Water is captured in Stampede Reservoir that is scheduled to be passed through and diverted to the Truckee Canal.

      (3) The Fish and Wildlife Service must approve any proposal to reduce diversions to Lahontan Reservoir for Newlands Project credit purposes without a comparable reduction in release from Stampede Reservoir or any conversion of Stampede Reservoir project water to Newlands Project credit water.

      (4) The diversion to Lahontan Reservoir may be adjusted any time during the month as revised runoff forecasts become available. The accumulated credit will be added to current Lahontan Reservoir storage (ALRS) in calculating TRD. If the sum of accumulated credit and Lahontan Reservoir storage exceeds 295,000 acre-feet, credit will be reduced by the amount in excess of 295,000 acre-feet. Credit will also be reduced by the amount of precautionary drawdown or spills in that month. If the end-of-month storage in Lahontan Reservoir plus the accumulated credit in Stampede Reservoir at the end of June exceeds the end-of-month storage objective for Lahontan, the credit will be reduced by the amount exceeding the end-of-month storage objective.

      (5) Following consultation with the District, the Federal Water Master, and other interested parties as appropriate, the Bureau will release credit water as needed for Project purposes from July 1 through the end of the irrigation season in which the credit accrues with timing priority given to meeting current year Project irrigation demands.

      (6) Conveyance of credit water in the Truckee Canal must be in addition to regularly scheduled diversions for the Project and will be measured at the USGS gauge number 10351300 near Wadsworth.

      (7) Newlands credit water in Stampede Reservoir storage will be subject to spill and will not carry over to subsequent years. Newlands credit water in Stampede can be exchanged to other reservoirs and retain its priority. The credit must be reduced to the extent that Lahontan Reservoir storage plus accumulated credit at the end of the previous month exceeds the storage objectives for that month. If Newlands credit water is spilled, it may be diverted to Lahontan Reservoir subject to applicable storage targets.

      (i) The Bureau, in consultation with the District, the Federal Water Master, and other interested parties, may release Newlands Project credit water before July 1.

      (ii) If any Newlands credit water remains in Stampede Reservoir storage after the end of the current irrigation season in which it accumulated, it will convert to water for cui-ui recovery and will no longer be available for Newlands credit water.

      (iii) Newlands credit water stored in Stampede Reservoir will be available for use only on the Carson Division of the Newlands Project.

      (g) Subject to the provisions of § 418.20 (b), LSOCM may be adjusted as frequently as necessary when new information indicates the need and diversions from the Truckee River to the Truckee Canal must be adjusted daily or otherwise as frequently as necessary to meet the monthly storage objective.

      § 418.21   Diversion of Truckee River water to Lahontan Reservoir, July through December.

#### § § 418.21

      Truckee River diversions through the Truckee Canal to Lahontan Reservoir from July through December must be made only in accordance with the Adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir Storage Targets table and § 418.22. Diversions shall be started to achieve the end-of-month storage targets listed in the table in § 418.22 and will be discontinued when storage is forecast to meet or exceed the end-of-month storage targets at the end of the month. Diversions may be adjusted any time during the month as conditions warrant (i.e., new forecasts, information from other forecasts becoming available, or any other new information that may impact stream forecasts).

      § 418.22   Future adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir storage targets.

#### § § 418.22

      (a) The Lahontan Reservoir storage targets must be adjusted to accommodate changes in water demand in the Carson Division. Using the information reported by the District by March 1 of each year on eligible land expected to be irrigated and end-of-year data on eligible land actually irrigated (§ 418.9(b)), the Bureau will determine if the Lahontan Reservoir storage targets need to be changed. If no change is needed, the storage targets currently in effect will remain in effect.

      (1) Only the actual water demand reported for full water years (100 percent water supply) will be considered. Targets will not be changed based on water demand reported for less than full water years.

      (2) All changes in storage targets must start on October 1 of any year. If information provided by March 1 and other available information indicates that the Lahontan Reservoir storage targets must be changed, the new set of storage targets must be applied starting October 1 of the same year and remain in effect until changed according to this section.

      (b) All changes to storage targets will be made according to the table in this section. The table of storage targets has been developed to provide a consistent Project water supply over a range of demands.

      (1) A storage target adjustment must be made in increments of thousands of acre-feet for the change as indicated in the column listing Carson Division Demand and the complete set of monthly targets must be applied.

      (2) If the change in reported water demand is above or below the values in the table of storage targets, the adjustment to the storage targets can be calculated. The calculated adjustment is the number that would appear in the column Target Adjustment in the table. The calculated Target Adjustment is then added or subtracted to the base storage target for each month. Target Adjustments must be made in whole increments of 1,000 acre-feet and calculated values will be rounded to the nearest 1,000 acre-feet.

      (i) For demands greater than those set forth on the table, the formula for the Target Adjustment is: Target Adjustment = 0.00208 (Demand in acre-feet—271,000 acre-feet). For example, if water demand increased to 292,635 acre-feet per year, the Target Adjustment calculation would be = 0.00208 × (292,535−271,000). The result would be a Target Adjustment of 45 or 45,000 acre-feet. This would be added to the base monthly storage target values so, the January-May target would be 219,000 acre-feet, June would be 235,000 acre-feet, and so on.

      (ii) For demands less than those set forth on the table, the formula for the Target Adjustment is: Target Adjustment = 0.00174 (Demand in acre-feet—271,000 acre-feet). For example, if water demand decreased to 248,011 acre-feet per year, the Target Adjustment calculation would be = 0.00174 × (248,011−271,000). The result would be a Target Adjustment of −40 or −40,000 acre-feet. This would be subtracted from the base monthly storage target values so, the January-May target would be 134,000 acre-feet, June would be 150,000 acre-feet, and so on.

      § 418.23   Diversion of Rock Dam Ditch water.

#### § § 418.23

      Project water may be diverted directly to Rock Dam Ditch from the Truckee Canal only when diversions cannot be made from the outlet works of Lahontan Reservoir. Such diversions will require the prior written approval of the Bureau and be used in calculating Project diversions.

      § 418.24   Precautionary drawdown and spills from Lahontan Reservoir.

#### § § 418.24

      (a) Even though flood control is not a specifically authorized purpose of the Project, at the request of the District and in consultation with other interested parties and the approval of the Bureau, precautionary drawdown of Lahontan Reservoir may be made to limit potential flood damage along the Carson River. The Bureau will develop criteria for precautionary drawdown in consultation with the District and other interested parties.

      (1) The drawdown must be scheduled sufficiently in advance and at such a rate of flow in order to divert as much water as possible into the Project irrigation system for delivery to eligible land or storage in reregulating reservoirs for later use on eligible land.

      (2) During periods of precautionary drawdown, or when water is spilled from Lahontan Reservoir, Project diversions will be determined by comparison with other years' data and normalized by comparison of differences in climatological data. The Bureau will estimate the normalization in consultation with the District and other interested parties.

      (3) Spills from Lahontan Reservoir and precautionary drawdown of the reservoir to create space for storing flood waters from the Carson River Basin that are in excess of the normalized diversions will not be used in calculating Project diversions.

      (4) Water captured in Project facilities as a result of a precautionary drawdown or spill will not be counted as storage in Lahontan Reservoir for the purpose of calculating Truckee River Diversions. Such water will not be counted as diversions to the Project unless such water is beneficially applied as described in (a)(5) of this section.

      (5) Water from precautionary drawdowns or spills that is captured in Project facilities must be used to the maximum extent possible, and counted as deliveries to eligible lands in the year of the drawdown. If all the drawdown water captured in Project facilities cannot be used in the year of capture for delivery to eligible lands, then that water must be delivered to eligible lands in subsequent years to the maximum extent possible and counted against the water users' annual allocation.

      (b) If a precautionary drawdown in one month results in a failure to meet the Lahontan Reservoir storage objective for that month, the storage objective in subsequent months will be reduced by one-half of the difference between that month's storage objective and actual end-of-month storage. The Bureau is not liable for any damage or water shortage resulting from a precautionary drawdown.

      § 418.25   Water use for other than Newlands Project purposes.

#### § § 418.25

      The District will release sufficient water to meet the vested water rights below Sagouspe Dam as specified in the  decree. These water rights are usually met by return flows. Releases for these water rights will in no case exceed the portion of 1,300 acre-feet per year not supplied by return flows. This water must be accounted for at the USGS gauge number 10312275 (the Carson River at Tarzyn Road near Fallon). Releases for this purpose will not be considered in determining Project diversions since the lands to which the water is being delivered are not part of the Project. (See § 418.15(b)(2)(ii).) Any flow past this gage in excess of the amount specified in this part will be absorbed by the District as an efficiency loss.

      § 418.26   Charges for water use.

#### § § 418.26

      The District must maintain a financing and accounting system which produces revenue sufficient to repay its operation and maintenance costs and to discharge any debt to the United States. The District should give consideration to adopting a system which provides reasonable financial incentives for the economical and efficient use of water.

      § 418.27   Distribution system operation.

#### § § 418.27

      (a) The District must permit only its authorized employees or agents to open and close individual turnouts and operate the distribution system facilities. After obtaining Bureau approval, the District may appoint agents to operate individual headgates on a specific lateral if it can be shown that the water introduced to the lateral by a District employee is completely scheduled and can be fully accounted for with a reasonable allowance for seepage and evaporation losses.

      (b) If agents need to adjust the scheduled delivery of water to the lateral to accommodate variable field conditions, weather, etc., they must immediately notify the District so proper adjustments can be made in the distribution system. Each agent must keep an accurate record of start and stop times for each delivery and the flow during delivery. This record will be given to the District for proper accounting of water delivered.

      (c) The program of using agents to operate individual headgates will be reviewed on a regular basis by the District and the Bureau. If it is found that problems such as higher than normal losses, water not accounted for, etc., have developed on an individual lateral, the program will be suspended and the system operated by District employees until the problems are resolved.

    Enforcement

      § 418.28   Conditions of delivery.

#### § § 418.28

      There are four basic elements for enforcement with all necessary quantities and review determined in accordance with the relevant sections of this part.

      (a)  If water is delivered to ineligible land or in excess of the appropriate water duty then:

      (1) The District will stop the illegal delivery immediately;

      (2) The District will notify the Bureau of the particulars including the known or estimated location and amounts;

      (3) The amount will not be included as a valid headgate delivery for purposes of computing the Project efficiency and resultant incentive credit or debit to Lahontan storage; and

      (4) If the amount applies to a prior year, then the amount will be treated directly as a debit to Lahontan storage in the same manner as an efficiency debit.

      (b)  To the extent that the actual District efficiency determined for an irrigation season is greater or less than the established target efficiency, as determined for the corresponding actual valid headgate deliveries, then the difference in efficiency, expressed as a quantity in acre-feet, may be added to or subtracted from the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level before it is compared to the monthly storage objective as follows:

      (1) Greater efficiency—Credited to the District as storage in Lahontan or subtracted from any accumulated debit, or two-thirds as storage in Lahontan for their discretionary use in accordance with state law.

      (2) Less efficient—Debited or added to Lahontan storage as an adjustment to the actual storage level.

      (c)  The MAD must be computed each year to determine the amount of water required to enable the delivery of full entitlements at established Project efficiencies. Project diversions must not exceed the MAD. Within the operating year, the Bureau will notify the District in writing of any expected imminent violations of the MAD. The District will take prompt action to avoid such violations. The Bureau will exercise reasonable latitude from month to month to accommodate the District's efforts to avoid exceeding the MAD.

      (d)  If the MED exceeds 26,000 AF at the end of any given year, the District must prepare and submit to the Bureau for review and approval, a plan detailing the actions the District will take to either earn adequate incentive credits or to restrict deliveries to reduce the MED to less than 26,000 AF by the end of the next year. The plan must be submitted to the Bureau in writing before the date of March 1 immediately subsequent to the exceeding of the MED. If the District fails to submit an approvable plan, Project allocations will be reduced by an amount equal to the MED in excess of 26,000 plus 13,000 (one-half the allowable MED). Nominally this will mean a forced reduction of approximately five percent of entitlements. The Bureau will notify the District in writing of the specific allocation and method of derivation in sufficient time for the District to implement the allocation. Liabilities arising from shortages occasioned by operation of this provision must be the responsibility of the District or individual water users.

      § 418.29   Project management.

#### § § 418.29

      In addition to the provisions of § 418.28, if the District is found to be operating Project facilities or any part thereof in substantial violation of this part, then, upon the determination by the Bureau, the Bureau may take over from the District the care, operation, maintenance, and management of the diversion and outlet works (Derby Dam and Lahontan Dam/Reservoir) or any or all of the transferred works by giving written notice to the District of the determination and its effective date. Following written notification from the Bureau, the care, operation, and maintenance of the works may be retransferred to the District.

      § 418.30   Provisions required in future contracts.

#### § § 418.30

      The Bureau must provide in new, amended, or replacement contracts for the operation and maintenance of Project works, for the reservation by the Secretary of rights and options to enforce this part.

    Water Management and Conservation

      § 418.31   Conservation measures.

#### § § 418.31

      (a) Specific conservation actions will be needed for the District and its members to achieve a reasonable efficiency of operation as required by this part. The District is best able to determine the particular conservation measures that meet the needs of its water users. This ensures that the measures reflect the priorities and collective judgment of the water users; and will be practical, understandable and supported. The District also has the discretion to make changes in the measures they adopt as conditions or results dictate.

      (b) The District will keep the Bureau informed of the measures they expect to utilize during each year. This will enable the Bureau to stay apprised of any helpful information that may, in turn, help the Bureau assist other irrigation districts. The Bureau will work cooperatively in support of the District's selection of measures and methods of implementation.

      § 418.32   Cooperative programs.

#### § § 418.32

      (a) The Bureau and the District will work cooperatively to develop a water management and conservation program to promote efficient management of water in the Project. The program will emphasize developing methods, including computerization and automation, to improve the District's operations and procedures for greater water delivery conservation.

      (b) The Bureau will provide technical assistance to the District and cooperatively assist the District in their obligations and efforts to:

      (1) Document and evaluate existing water delivery and measurement practices:

      (2) Implement improvements to these practices; and

      (3) Evaluate and, where practical, implement physical changes to Project facilities.

    Implementation

      § 418.33   Purpose of the implementation strategy.

#### § § 418.33

      The intent of the implementation strategy for this part is to ensure that the District delivers water within entitlements at a reasonable level of efficiency as a long term average.

      (a) The incentives and disincentives provided in this part are designed to encourage local officials with responsibilities for Project operations to select and implement through their discretionary actions, operating strategies which achieve the principles of this part.

      (b) The specified efficiencies in the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table (§ 418.13 (a)(4)) were developed considering implementation of reasonable conservation measures, historic project operations, economics, and environmental effects.

      (c) The efficiency target will be used as a performance standard to establish at the end of each year on the basis of actual operations, whether the District is entitled to a performance bonus in the form of incentive water or a reduction in storage for the amount borrowed ahead.

      § 418.34   Valid headgate deliveries.

#### § § 418.34

      Project water may be delivered to headgates only as provided in §§ 418.8 and 418.10. Water delivered to lands that are not entitled to be irrigated or not in accord with decreed water duties is difficult to quantify at best because it is not typically measured. Since it is not likely to be a part of the total actual headgate deliveries, yet is a part of the total deliveries to the Project, it will manifest itself directly as a lower efficiency. Thus, it will either reduce the District's incentive credit or increase the storage debit by the amount improperly diverted. All other users outside the Project are thereby held harmless but the District incurs the consequence. This approach should eliminate any potential disputes between the District and the Bureau regarding the quantity of water misappropriated.

      § 418.35   Efficiencies.

#### § § 418.35

      The established target efficiencies under this part are shown in the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table (§ 418.13 (a)(4)). The efficiency of the Project will vary with the amount of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates. Since most of the distribution system losses such as evaporation and seepage do not change significantly with the amount of water delivered (i.e., these losses are principally a function of water surface area and the wetted perimeter of the canals), the Project efficiency requirement is higher as the percent of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates increases. The actual efficiency is calculated each year after the close of the irrigation season based on actual measured amounts. The application of any adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir storage or Truckee River diversions resulting from the efficiency is always prospective.

      § 418.36   Incentives for additional long term conservation.

#### § § 418.36

      (a) As an incentive for the District to increase the efficiency of the delivery system beyond the expected efficiency of 65.7 percent (66.9 percent with full delivery) as shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table, 1995 Example, the District will be allowed to store and use the Carson River portion of the saved water at its discretion, in accordance with Nevada State Law and this part.

      (1) If the District is able to exceed its expected efficiency, the District may store in Lahontan Reservoir two-thirds (2/3) of the additional water saved. (The remaining one-third (1/3) of the water saved will remain in the Truckee River through reduced diversions to Lahontan Reservoir). This water will be considered incentive water saved from the Carson River and will not be counted as storage in determining diversions from the Truckee River or computing the target storage levels for Lahontan Reservoir under this part.

      (2) For purposes of this part, incentive water is no longer considered Project water. The District may use the water for any purpose (e.g., wetlands, storage for recreation, power generation, shortage reduction) that is consistent with Nevada State Law and Federal Law. The water will be managed under the District's discretion and may be stored in Lahontan Reservoir until needed subject to the limitations in (a)(3) of this section.

      (3) The amount of incentive water stored in Lahontan Reservoir will be reduced under the following conditions:

      (i) There is a deficit created and remaining in Lahontan Reservoir from operations penalties in a prior year;

      (ii) The District releases the water from the reservoir for its designated use;

      (iii) During a spill of the reservoir, the amount of incentive water must be reduced by the amount of spill; and

      (iv) At the discretion of the District, incentive water may be used to offset the precautionary drawdown adjustment to the Lahontan storage objective.

      (v) At the end of each year, the amount of incentive water will be reduced by the incremental amount of evaporation which occurs as a result of the increased surface area of the reservoir due to the additional storage. The evaporation rate used will be either the net evaporation measured or the net historical average after precipitation is taken into account. The method of calculation will be agreed to by the District and the Bureau in advance of any storage credit.

      (b) An example of this concept is:

      § 418.37   Disincentives for lower efficiency.

#### § § 418.37

      (a) If the District fails to meet the efficiencies established by this part, then, in effect, the District has borrowed from a subsequent year. The amount borrowed will be accounted for in the form of a deficit in Lahontan Reservoir storage. This deficit amount will be added to the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage quantity for the purpose of determining the Truckee River diversions to meet storage objectives as well as all other operating decisions.

      (b) The amount of the deficit will be cumulative from year to year but will not be allowed to exceed 26,000 acre-feet (the expected variance between the MAD and actual water use). This limit is expected to avoid increasing the severity of drought and yet still allow for variations in efficiency over time due to weather and other factors. This approach should allow the District to plan its operation to correct for any deficiencies.

      (c) The deficit can be reduced by crediting incentive water earned by the District or reducing the percentage of headgate entitlement delivered either through a natural drought or by the District and its water users administratively limiting deliveries while maintaining an efficiency greater than or equal to the target efficiency.

      (d) If there is a natural drought and the shortage to the headgates is equal to or greater than the deficit, then the deficit is reduced to zero. If the shortage to headgates is less than the deficit then the deficit is reduced by an amount equal to the headgate shortage. During a natural drought, if the percentage of maximum headgate entitlement delivered is 75 percent or more then the District will be subject to the target efficiencies and resultant deficits or credits.

      (e) If the District has a deficit in Lahontan Reservoir and earns incentive water, the incentive water must be used to eliminate the deficit before it can be used for any other purpose. The deficit must be credited on a 1 to 1 basis (i.e., actual efficiency savings rather than  -  for incentive water).

      (f) An example of the penalty concept is:

      § 418.38   Maximum allowable diversion.

#### § § 418.38

      (a) The MAD established in this part is based on the premise that the Project should be operated to ensure that it is capable of delivering to the headgate of each water right holder the full water entitlement for irrigable eligible acres and includes distribution system losses. The MAD will be established (and is likely to vary) each year. The annual MAD will be calculated each year based on the actual acreage to be irrigated that year.

      (b) Historically, actual deliveries at farm headgates have been approximately 90 percent of entitlements. This practice is expected to continue but the percentage is expected to change. This variance between headgate deliveries and headgate entitlements will be calculated annually under this part and is allowed to be diverted if needed and thereby provides an assurance that full headgate deliveries can be made. The expected diversion and associated efficiency target for the examples shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table would be: 285,243 AF and 65.1 percent in 1996 and beyond. These are well below the MAD limits; however, the District may divert up to the MAD if it is needed to meet valid headgate entitlements.

Interest will accrue on both the construction expenditures and funded operation and maintenance deficits from October 12, 1982, on costs outstanding at that date, or from the date incurred in the case of costs arising subsequent to October 12, 1982. The _full-cost rate_ includes actual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs required under Federal reclamation law.

    means the full-cost rate less the actual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs required under Federal reclamation law.

    when used in connection with the terms landholder, landowner, lessee, lessor or owner, means that such party is not the owner of record or holder of title, or the lessee of a land parcel, but that such party has a beneficial interest in the legal entity that is the owner of record or holder of title, or the lessee of a land parcel. Landholdings of joint tenants and tenants-in-common will be considered indirect under these regulations. A security interest held by lenders, who are not otherwise considered a landholder of the land in question, in a legal entity or in a land parcel will not be considered an indirect interest or a beneficial interest for purposes of these regulations.

    means a party that directly or indirectly owns or leases nonexempt land.

    means the total acreage of nonexempt land directly or indirectly owned or leased by a landholder.

    means any arrangement between a landholder (the lessor) and another party (the lessee) under which the economic risk and the use or possession of the lessor's land is partially or wholly transferred to the lessee. If a management arrangement or consulting agreement is one in which the manager or consultant performs a service for the landholder for a fee, but does not assume the economic risk in the farming operation, and the landholder retains the right to the use and possession of the land, is responsible for payment of the operating expenses, and is entitled to receive the profits from the farming operation, then the agreement or arrangement will not be considered to be a lease.

    for the purpose of establishing application of the acreage limitation entitlements means, but is not limited to, corporations, partnerships, organizations, and any business or property ownership arrangements such as joint tenancies and tenancies-in-common. For purposes of the information requirements specified in § 426.18 only, trusts will be considered to be legal entities.

    § 426.3   Conformance to the discretionary provisions.

#### § § 426.3

    (a)  Unless an exemption in § 426.16 applies, a district is subject to the discretionary provisions if:

    (1) The district executes a new or renewed contract with Reclamation after October 12, 1982. The discretionary provisions apply as of the execution date of the new or renewed contract;

    (2) The district amends its contract to conform to the discretionary provisions:

    (i) A district may ask Reclamation to amend its contract to conform to the discretionary provisions;

    (ii) The district's request to Reclamation must be accompanied by a duly adopted resolution dated and signed by the governing board of the district obligating the district to take, in a timely manner, actions required by applicable State law to amend its contract; and

    (iii) If the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are met, then Reclamation will amend the contract, and the district becomes subject to the discretionary provisions from the date the district's request was submitted to Reclamation;

    (iv) If the district only wants to amend its contracts to become subject to the discretionary provisions, the amendments need only be to the extent required to conform to the discretionary provisions; or

    (3) The district amends its contract after October 12, 1982, to provide the district with additional or supplemental benefits. The amendment must also include the district's conformance to the discretionary provisions:

    (i) The discretionary provisions apply as of the date that Reclamation executes the contract amendment;

    (ii) For purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions Reclamation considers a contract amendment as providing additional or supplemental benefits if that amendment:

    (A) Requires the United States to expend significant funds;

    (B) Requires the United States to commit significant additional water supplies; or

    (C) Substantially modifies contract payments due the United States; and

    (iii) For purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions Reclamation does not consider the following contract actions as providing additional or supplemental benefits:

    (A) The construction of facilities for conveyance of irrigation water for which districts contracted on or before October 12, 1982;

    (B) Minor drainage and construction work contracted under a prior repayment or water service contract;

    (C) Operation and maintenance (O&M) amendments;

    (D) The deferral of payments provided the deferral is for a period of 12 months or less;

    (E) A temporary supply of irrigation water as set forth in § 426.16(d);

    (F) The transfer of water on an annual basis from one district to another, provided that:

    () Both districts have contracts with the United States;

    () The rate paid by the district receiving the transferred water:

    () Is the h_i_gher of the applicable water rate for either district;

    () Does not result in any increased operating losses to the United States above those that would have existed in the absence of the transfer; and

    () Does not result in any decrease in capital repayment to the United States below what would have existed in the absence of the transfer; and

    () The recipients of the transferred water pay a rate for the water that is at least equal to the actual O&M costs or the full-cost rate in those cases where, for whatever reason, the recipients would have been subject to such costs had the water not been considered transferred water;

    (G) Contract actions pursuant to the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978, as amended (43 U.S.C. 506); or

    (H) Other contract actions that Reclamation determines do not provide additional or supplemental benefits.

    (b)  Any district which had a contract in force on October 12, 1982, that required landholders to comply with the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law remains subject to prior law unless and until the district:

    (1) Enters into a new or renewed contract requiring it to conform to the discretionary provisions, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

    (2) Makes a contract action requiring conformance to the discretionary provisions, as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) or (3) of this section; or

    (3) Becomes exempt, as provided in § 426.16.

    (c)  (1) New or renewed contracts executed after October 12, 1982, or contracts that are amended to conform to the discretionary provisions before or on the effective date of these rules must include the following clause:

    (2) New or renewed contracts executed after the effective date of these rules, or contracts that are amended to conform to the discretionary provisions after the effective date of these rules must include the following clause:

    (d)  If a district provides irrigation water to other districts through subcontracts and the master contracting district is subject to:

    (1) The discretionary provisions, then all subcontracting districts who are entitled to receive irrigation water must also conform to the discretionary provisions; or

    (2) Prior law, then the subcontracting district can amend its subcontract to conform to the discretionary provisions without subjecting the master contractor or any other subcontractor of the master contractor to the discretionary provisions. If a subcontract that does not include the United States as a party is amended to conform to the discretionary provisions, or the subcontract is a new or renewed contract executed after October 12, 1982, then the amended, new, or renewed subcontract must include the United States as a party.

    (e)  If a district conforms to the discretionary provisions and the landholder is:

    (1) Other than a nonresident alien or a legal entity that is not established under State or Federal law, and is:

    (i) A direct landholder in that district, then the landholder becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the associated acreage limitation status will apply in any district in which the landholder holds land; or

    (ii) Only an indirect landholder in that and all other discretionary provisions districts, then the landholder's acreage limitation status is not affected. Such a landholder can receive irrigation water as a prior law recipient on indirectly held lands in districts that conform to the discretionary provisions.

    (2) A nonresident alien, or legal entity not established under State or Federal law, and the landholder is:

    (i) A direct landholder, then since such a landholder cannot become subject to, and has no eligibility under the discretionary provisions:

    (A) All direct landholdings in districts that conform to the discretionary provisions become ineligible; and

    (B) Directly held land that becomes ineligible as a result of the district's action to conform to the discretionary provisions may be placed under recordable contract as subject to the conditions specified in § 426.12; or

    (ii) An indirect landholder, then such a landholder may receive irrigation water on land indirectly held in districts conforming to the discretionary provisions, with the entitlements for such landholder determined as specified in § 426.8.

    (f)  (1) In the absence of a district's action to conform to the discretionary provisions, United States citizens, resident aliens, or legal entities established under State or Federal law, can elect to conform to the discretionary provisions by executing an irrevocable election. Upon execution of an irrevocable election:

    (i) The elector's entire landholding in all districts shall be subject to the discretionary provisions;

    (ii) The election shall be binding on the elector and his or her landholding, but will not be binding on subsequent landholders of that land;

    (iii) An irrevocable election by a legal entity is binding only upon that entity and not on the part owners of that entity;

    (iv) An irrevocable election by a part owner of a legal entity binds only the part owner making the election and not the entity or other part owners of the entity; and

    (v) An irrevocable election by a lessor does not affect the status of a lessee, and vice versa. However, the eligibility and entitlement of neither a lessor nor a lessee may be enhanced through leasing.

    (2) A landholder makes an irrevocable election by completing a Reclamation issued irrevocable election form:

    (i) The elector's original irrevocable election form must be filed by the district with Reclamation and must be accompanied by a completed certification form, as specified in § 426.18;

    (ii) The elector must file copies of the irrevocable election and certification forms concurrently with each district where the elector holds nonexempt land;

    (iii) Reclamation will prepare a letter advising the recipient of the approval or disapproval of the election. Reclamation will base approval upon whether the election form and the accompanying certification form(s) indicate the elector's satisfaction of the various requirements of Federal reclamation law and these regulations;

    (iv) If the election is approved, the letter of approval, with a copy of the irrevocable election form and the original certification form(s), will be sent by Reclamation to each district where the elector holds land;

    (v) The district(s) shall retain the forms; and

    (vi) If the irrevocable election is disapproved, the landholder and the district will be advised by letter along with the reasons for disapproval.

    (3) A landholder that only holds land indirectly in a district that has conformed to the discretionary provisions, other than a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, may make an irrevocable election also by simply submitting certification forms to all districts where the landholder holds land subject to the acreage limitation provisions. An election made in this manner is binding in all districts in which such elector holds land.

    (g)  The district is entitled to rely on the information contained in the irrevocable election form. The district does not need to make an independent investigation of the information.

    (h)  Reclamation will allow at anytime a landholder to elect or a district to amend its contract to conform to the discretionary provisions. An irrevocable election that was made after April 12, 1987, but on or before May 13, 1987, shall be considered effective as of April 12, 1987.

    § 426.4   Attribution of land.

#### § § 426.4

    (a)  Except as specifically provided in these rules, a landholder cannot increase acreage limitation entitlements or eligibility by acquiring or holding a beneficial interest in a legal entity. Similarly, the acreage limitation status of an individual or legal entity that holds or has acquired a beneficial interest in another legal entity will not be permitted to enlarge the latter legal entity's acreage limitation entitlements or eligibility.

    (b)  For purposes of determining acreage to be counted against acreage limitation entitlements, acreage will be attributed to all:

    (1) Direct landowners in proportion to the direct beneficial interest the landowners own in the land; and

    (2) Indirect landowners in proportion to the indirect beneficial interest they own in the land.

    (c)  Leased land will be attributed to the direct and indirect landowners as well as to the direct and indirect lessees in the same manner as described in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.

    (d)  If land is held by a direct landholder and a series of indirect landholders, Reclamation will attribute that land to the acreage limitation entitlements of the direct landholder and each indirect landholder in proportion to each landholder's beneficial interest in the entity that directly holds the land.

    (e)  Any land a landholder directly or indirectly owns and that is directly or indirectly leased back will only count once against that particular landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement.

    (f)  For purposes of determining eligibility, the entire landholding will be attributed to all the direct and indirect landholders. If the interests in a legal entity are:

    (1) Undivided, then all of the indirect part owners must be eligible in order for the entity to be eligible; or

    (2) Divided, in such a manner that specific parcels are attributable to each indirect landholder, then the entity may qualify for eligibility on those portions of the landholding not attributable to any part owner who is ineligible.

    § 426.5   Ownership entitlement.

#### § § 426.5

    (a)  Except as provided in §§ 426.12 and 426.14, all nonexempt land directly or indirectly owned by a landholder counts against that landholder's ownership entitlement. In addition, land owned or controlled by a public entity that is leased to another party counts against the lessee's ownership entitlement, as specified in § 426.10.

    (b)  A qualified recipient is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 960 acres of owned nonexempt land, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. This entitlement applies on a westwide basis.

    (c)  A limited recipient is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 640 acres of owned nonexempt land, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. This entitlement applies on a westwide basis.

    (d)  (1) Ownership entitlements for prior law recipients are determined by whether the recipient is one individual or a married couple, and for entities by the type of entity, as follows:

    (i) An individual subject to prior law is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;

    (ii) Married couples who hold equal interests are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 320 acres of jointly owned nonexempt land;

    (iii) Surviving spouses until remarriage are entitled to receive irrigation water on that land owned jointly in marriage up to a maximum of 320 acres of owned nonexempt land. If any of that land should be sold, the applicable ownership entitlement would be reduced accordingly, but not to less than 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;

    (iv) Children are each entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land, regardless of whether they are independent or dependent;

    (v) Joint tenancies and tenancies-in-common subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land per tenant, provided each tenant holds an equal interest in the tenancy;

    (vi) Partnerships subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land per partner if the partners have separable and equal interests in the partnership and the right to alienate that interest. Partnerships where each partner does not have a separable interest and the right to alienate that interest are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of nonexempt land owned by the partnership; and

    (vii) All corporations subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land.

    (2) Prior law recipient ownership entitlements specified in this section apply on a westwide basis unless the land was acquired by the current owner on or before December 6, 1979. For land acquired by the current owner on or before that date, prior law ownership entitlements apply on a district-by-district basis.

    (3) For those entities where an equal interest held by the part owners would result in a 160-acre per part owner entitlement for the entity, if the part owners interests are not equal then the entitlement of the entity will be determined by the relative interest held in the entity by each part owner.

    § 426.6   Leasing and full-cost pricing.

#### § § 426.6

    (a)  Districts can make irrigation water available to leased land only if the lease meets the following requirements. Land that is leased under a lease instrument that does not meet the following requirements will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until the lease agreement is terminated or modified to satisfy these requirements.

    (1) The lease is in writing;

    (2) The lease includes the effective date and term of the lease, the length of which must be:

    (i) 10 years or less, including any exercisable options; however, for perennial crops with an average life longer than 10 years, the term may be equal to the average life of the crop as determined by Reclamation, and

    (ii) In no case may the term of a lease exceed 25 years, including any exercisable options;

    (3) The lease includes a legal description, that is at least as detailed as what is required on the standard certification and reporting forms, of the land subject to the lease;

    (4) Signatures of all parties to the lease are included;

    (5) The lease includes the date(s) or conditions when lease payments are due and the amounts or the method of computing the payments due;

    (6) The lease is available for Reclamation's inspection and Reclamation reviews and approves all leases for terms longer than 10 years; and

    (7) If either the lessor or the lessee is subject to the discretionary provisions, the lease provides for agreed upon payments that reflect the reasonable value of the irrigation water to the productivity of the land; except

    (8) Leases in effect as of the effective date of these regulations do not need to meet the criteria specified under paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, unless and until such leases are renewed.

    (b)  (1) The nonfull-cost entitlement for qualified recipients is 960 acres, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof.

    (2) The nonfull-cost entitlement for limited recipients that received irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, is 320 acres or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. The nonfull-cost entitlement for limited recipients that did not receive irrigation water on or prior to October 1, 1981, is zero.

    (3) The nonfull-cost entitlement for prior law recipients is equal to the recipient's maximum ownership entitlement as set forth in § 426.5(d). However, for the purpose of computing the acreage subject to full cost, all owned and leased irrigation land westwide must be included in the computation.

    (c)  (1) A landholder may irrigate at the nonfull-cost rate directly and indirectly held acreage equal to his or her nonfull-cost entitlement.

    (2) If a landholding exceeds the landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement, the landholder must pay the appropriate full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to acreage that equals the amount of leased land that exceeds that entitlement.

    (3) In the case of limited recipients, a landholder does not have to lease land to exceed a nonfull-cost entitlement, since the nonfull-cost entitlement is less than the ownership entitlement. Therefore, limited recipients must pay the appropriate full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any acreage that exceeds their nonfull-cost entitlement.

    (d)  (1) All directly and indirectly owned irrigation land and irrigation land directly or indirectly leased for any period of time during 1-water year counts towards a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement, except:

    (i) Involuntarily acquired land, as provided in §§ 426.12 and 426.14; and

    (ii) Land that is leased for incidental grazing or similar purposes during periods when the land is not receiving irrigation water.

    (2) Reclamation's process for determining if a nonfull-cost entitlement has been exceeded is as follows:

    (i) All land counted toward a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement will be counted on a cumulative basis during any 1-water year;

    (ii) Once a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement is met in a given water year, any additional eligible land may be irrigated only at the full-cost rate; and

    (iii) Irrigation land will be counted towards nonfull-cost entitlements on a westwide basis, even for prior law recipients, regardless of the date of acquisition.

    (e)  (1) A landholder that has exceeded his or her nonfull-cost entitlement may select in each water year, from his or her directly held irrigation land, the land that can be irrigated at a nonfull-cost rate and the land that can be irrigated only at the full-cost rate. Selections for full-cost or nonfull-cost land may include:

    (i) Leased land;

    (ii) Nonexcess owned land;

    (iii) Land under recordable contract, unless that land is already subject to application of the full-cost rate under an extended recordable contract; or

    (iv) A combination of all three.

    (2) Once a landholder has received irrigation water on a given land parcel during a water year, the selection of that parcel as full cost or nonfull-cost is binding until the landholder has completed receiving irrigation water westwide for that water year.

    (f)  If a landowner or lessee should select land as subject to full-cost pricing, then that land can receive irrigation water only at the full-cost rate, regardless of eligibility of the other party to receive the irrigation water at the nonfull-cost rate.

    (g)  Land that is subleased (the lessee transfers possession of the land to a sublessee) will be attributed to the landholding of the sublessee and not to the lessee.

    (h)  Reclamation will calculate a district's full-cost charge using accepted accounting procedures and under the following conditions.

    (1) The full-cost charge does not recover interest retroactively before October 12, 1982. But, interest on the unpaid balance does accrue from October 12, 1982, where the unpaid balance equals the irrigation allocated construction costs for facilities in service plus cumulative federally funded O&M deficits, less payments.

    (2) The full-cost charge will be determined:

    (i) As of October 12, 1982, for contracts entered into before that date regardless of amendments to conform to the discretionary provisions; and

    (ii) At the time of contract execution for new and renewed contracts entered into on or after October 12, 1982.

    (3) For repayment contracts, the full-cost charge will fix equal annual payments over the amortization period. For water service contracts, the full-cost charge will fix equal payments per acre-foot of projected water deliveries over the amortization period.

    (4) If there are additional construction expenditures, or if the cost allocated to irrigation changes, then a new full-cost charge will be determined.

    (5) Reclamation will notify the respective districts of changes in the full-cost charge at the time the district is notified of other payments due the United States.

    (6) In determining full-cost charges, the following factors will be considered:

    (i)  The amortization period for calculating the full-cost charge is the remaining balance of:

    (A) For contracts entered into before October 12, 1982, the contract repayment period as of October 12, 1982;

    (B) For contracts entered into on or after October 12, 1982, the contract repayment period;

    (C) For water service contracts, the period from October 12, 1982, or the execution date of the contract, whichever is later, to the anticipated date of project repayment; and

    (D) In cases where water services rates are designed to completely repay applicable Federal expenditures in a specific time period, that time period may be used as the amortization period for full-cost calculations related to these expenditures; but, in no case will the amortization period exceed the project payback period authorized by the Congress;

    (ii)  For determining full cost, construction costs properly allocable to irrigation are those Federal project costs for facilities in service that have been assigned to irrigation within the overall allocation of total project construction costs. Total project construction costs include all direct expenditures necessary to install or implement a project, such as:

    (A) Planning;

    (B) Design;

    (C) Land;

    (D) Rights-of-way;

    (E) Water-rights acquisitions;

    (F) Construction expenditures;

    (G) Interest during construction; and

    (H) When appropriate, transfer costs associated with services provided from other projects;

    (iii)  Facilities in service are those facilities that are in operation and providing irrigation services;

    (iv)  O&M deficits funded are the annual O&M costs including project-use pumping power allocated to irrigation that have been federally funded and that have not been paid by the district;

    (v)  In calculating the payments that have been received, all receipts and credits applied to repay or reduce allocated irrigation construction costs in accordance with Federal reclamation law, policy, and applicable contract provisions will be considered. These may include:

    (A) Direct repayment contract revenues;

    (B) Net water service contract income;

    (C) Contributions;

    (D) Ad valorem taxes; and

    (E) Other miscellaneous revenues and credits excluding power and municipal and industrial (M&I) revenues;

    (vi)  Interest rates to be used in calculating full-cost charges will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as follows:

    (A) For irrigation water delivered to qualified recipients, limited recipients receiving water on or before October 1, 1981, and extended recordable contract land owned by prior law recipients, the interest rate for expenditures made on or before October 12, 1982, will be the greater of 7.5 percent per annum or the weighted average yield of all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury during the fiscal year when the expenditures were made by the United States. The interest rate for expenditures made after October 12, 1982, will be the arithmetic average of:

    () The computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations that are neither due nor callable for redemption for _1_5 years from the date of issuance at the beginning of the fiscal year when the expenditures are made; and

    () The weighted average yield on all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year the expenditures are made;

    (B) For irrigation water delivered to limited recipients not receiving irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, and prior law recipients, except for land owned subject to extended recordable contract, the interest rate will be determined as of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year the expenditures are made, except that the interest rate for expenditures made before October 12, 1982, will be determined as of October 12, 1982. The interest rate will be based on the arithmetic average of:

    () The computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations that are neither due nor callable for redemption for _1_5 years from the date of issuance; and

    () The weighted average yield on all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury.

    (C) Landholders who were prior law recipients and become subject to the discretionary provisions after April 12, 1987, are eligible for the full-cost interest rate specified in paragraph (h)(6)(vi)(A) of this section, unless they are limited recipients that did not receive irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, in that case they remain subject to the full-cost interest rate specified in paragraph (h)(6)(vi)(B) of this section.

    (i)  In situations where water delivery charges are contractually or customarily levied on a per-acre basis, full-cost assessments will be made on a per-acre basis. In situations where water delivery charges are contractually or customarily levied on a per acre-foot basis, one of the following methods must be used to make full-cost assessments:

    (1) Assessments will be based on the actual amounts of water used in situations where measuring devices are in use, to the satisfaction of Reclamation, to reasonably determine the amounts of irrigation water being delivered to full-cost and nonfull-cost land; or

    (2) In situations where, as determined by Reclamation, measuring devices are not a reliable method for determining the amounts of water being delivered to full-cost and nonfull-cost land, then water charges must be based on the assumption that equal amounts of water per acre are being delivered to both types of land during periods when both types of land are actually being irrigated.

    (j) —(1)  If irrigation water has been delivered in compliance with Federal reclamation law and these regulations, then:

    (i) That portion of the full-cost rate that would have been collected if the land had not been subject to full cost will be credited to the annual payments due under the district's contractual obligation;

    (ii) Any O&M revenues collected over and above those required under the district's contract will be credited to the project O&M account; and

    (iii) The remaining full-cost revenues will be credited to the Reclamation fund unless otherwise provided by law, with any capital component of the full-cost rate credited to project repayment, if applicable.

    (2)  Revenues resulting from the assessment of compensation charges for illegal deliveries of irrigation water will be deposited into the Reclamation fund in their entirety, and will not be credited toward any contractual obligation, or O&M or repayment account of the district or project. For purposes of these regulations only, this does not include revenues from any charges that may be assessed by the district to cover district operation, maintenance, and administrative expenses.

    § 426.7   Trusts.

#### § § 426.7

    (a)

    means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land that may be revoked at the discretion of the grantor(s), or terminated by the terms of the trust, and revocation or termination results in title to the land held in trust reverting either directly or indirectly to the grantor(s).

    means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land and does not allow any individual, including the grantor or beneficiaries, the discretion to decide when or under what conditions the trust terminates, and that upon termination the title to the land held in trust transfers either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).

    means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land and that may be revoked at the discretion of the grantor(s) or other parties, or terminated by the terms of the trust, and revocation or termination results in the title to the land held in trust transferring either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).

    (b)  The acreage limitation entitlements of a trust are only limited by the acreage limitation entitlements of the trustees, grantors, or beneficiaries to whom land held by the trust must be attributed as provided for in § 426.4. The entitlements of the parties to whom trusted land is attributed are determined according to §§ 426.5, 426.6, and 426.8, and other applicable provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations. Reclamation attributes nonexempt land held by a trust to the following parties:

    (1) For land held in an  the land is attributed to the beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial interest in the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are met. If the trust fails to meet any portion of these criteria, Reclamation attributes the land held in the trust to the trustee.

    (i) The trust is in written form and approved by Reclamation; and

    (ii) The beneficiaries of the trust and the beneficiaries' respective interests are identified within the trust document.

    (2) For land held in a  the land is attributed to the grantor according to the grantor's acreage limitation status and the land's eligibility immediately prior to its transfer to the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section are met. If the trust fails to meet any portion of these criteria, the land held in trust will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until all of the criteria are met. The only exception is if the trust's and grantor's standard certification or reporting forms indicate that the land held by the trust has been attributed to the trust's grantor(s).

    (i) The trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

    (ii) The grantor(s) of all land held by the trust is (are) identified within the trust document;

    (iii) The conditions under which the trust may be revoked or terminated are identified within the trust document; and

    (iv) The recipient(s) of the trust land upon revocation or termination is (are) identified within the trust document.

    (3) For land held in an  the land is attributed to the beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial interests in the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the trust meets the additional criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (i) If Reclamation cannot determine who will hold the land in trust upon termination or revocation of the trust, or who is the grantor(s) of the land held in trust, then irrigation water will not be made available to the land held in trust until the trust satisfies the additional criteria listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (ii) If the trust fails to meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but does meet the additional criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) through (iv) of this section, then the land is attributed to the trustee.

    (c)  For purposes of identifying beneficiaries, a class of beneficiaries specified within the trust document will be acceptable, as long as the trust document is specific as to the beneficial interest to which each member of the class will be entitled and the members of the class are identifiable.

    (1) Attribution during any given water year will be provided only to class beneficiaries that are natural persons and established legal entities. For purposes of administering the acreage limitation provisions, attribution to unborn or deceased persons, or entities not yet established, will not be allowed.

    (2) If a trust includes a class of beneficiaries to which land subject to the acreage limitation provisions will be attributed, the trustee and each of the beneficiaries will be required to submit standard certification or reporting forms annually. The submittal of verification forms, as provided in § 426.18(l), will not be applicable to such trusts.

    (d)  If a grantor revocable trust that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is revised by the grantor in a manner that precludes attribution of the land held in trust to the grantor:

    (1) Before April 20, 1988, Reclamation will not assess full-cost rates for the land held by the revised trust for the period before it was revised; or

    (2) On or after April 20, 1988, Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any land held by the trust that exceeds the grantor's nonfull-cost entitlement, commencing December 23, 1987, until the trust agreement is revised to make it an irrevocable trust or an otherwise revocable trust.

    § 426.8   Nonresident aliens and foreign entities.

#### § § 426.8

    (a)

    means a legal entity established under State or Federal law.

    means a legal entity not established under State or Federal law.

    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal reclamation law or these regulations, a nonresident alien or foreign entity that directly holds land in a district that is subject to the discretionary provisions is not eligible to receive irrigation water on such land. Nonresident aliens and foreign entities may hold land indirectly in discretionary districts and both directly and indirectly in prior law districts and receive irrigation water on such land, subject to their acreage limitation entitlements.

    (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all nonresident aliens and foreign entities will be considered prior law recipients, and shall have entitlements and eligibility only as prior law recipients as specified in §§ 426.5(d) and 426.6(b)(3).

    (d)  (1) If a nonresident alien is a citizen of or a foreign entity is established in a country that has one of the following treaties with the United States or is a member of the listed organization, then that nonresident alien or foreign entity will not be restricted to prior law entitlements, provided the eligible landholding subject to the acreage limitation provisions is held indirectly:

    (i) Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty;

    (ii) Bilateral Investment Treaty;

    (iii) North American Free Trade Agreement;

    (iv) Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement; or

    (v) Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

    (2) Nonresident aliens and foreign entities that meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be required to provide proof of citizenship or documentation certifying the country in which the entity in question was established. Districts will retain such documentation in the landholder's file.

    (3) If a nonresident alien or foreign entity meets the criteria listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and only holds eligible land subject to the acreage limitation provisions indirectly, then the nonresident alien may be treated as a United States citizen or the foreign entity may be treated as a domestic entity for purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions for the land held indirectly.

    (i) The nonresident alien or foreign entity may submit an irrevocable election to conform to the discretionary provisions as provided for in § 426.3(f). Conformance to the discretionary provisions through the submittal of a certification form will not be allowed as specified in § 426.3(f)(3).

    (ii) Upon Reclamation's approval of the irrevocable election, a nonresident alien will be treated as having the ownership entitlement of a qualified recipient as described in § 426.5(b), for any land held indirectly. A foreign entity will be treated as a qualified recipient or a limited recipient as determined by the number of natural persons who are beneficiaries of the entity as specified by the definitions found in § 426.2, and the subsequent entitlement as provided in § 426.5(b) or (c), for any land held indirectly. The applicable nonfull-cost entitlements will be determined as described in § 426.6(b).

    (iii) Reclamation will not approve irrevocable elections submitted by a nonresident alien or a foreign entity that holds any land directly in any prior law district.

    (iv) Reclamation will not approve irrevocable elections submitted by a nonresident alien that is not a citizen of or foreign entity that has not been established in a country that has a treaty or international membership as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    § 426.9   Religious or charitable organizations.

#### § § 426.9

    (a)

    means the organization to which all subdivisions, such as parishes, congregations, chapters, etc., ultimately report.

    means an organization or each congregation, chapter, parish, school, ward, or similar subdivision of a religious or charitable organization that is exempt from paying Federal taxes under § 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.

    (b)  (1) Religious or charitable organizations or their subdivisions that are subject to the discretionary provisions have qualified recipient status, if:

    (i) The organization's or subdivision's agricultural produce and proceeds from the sales of such produce are used only for charitable purposes;

    (ii) The organization or subdivision, itself, operates the land; and

    (iii) No part of the net earnings of the organization or subdivision accrues to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.

    (2) If Reclamation determines that a religious or charitable organization or any of its subdivisions does not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then:

    (i) If the central organization has not met the criteria, Reclamation will treat the entire organization, including all subdivisions, as a single entity; or

    (ii) If a subdivision has not met the criteria, only that subdivision and any subdivisions of it will be treated as a single entity and not the central organization or other subdivisions of the central organization; and

    (iii) In order to ascertain the acreage limitation status, Reclamation determines the total number of members in both the organization that has not met the criteria and in any subdivisions that are under that organization. If Reclamation determines that total number equals:

    (A) More than 25 members, then Reclamation treats that organization and every subdivision under that organization as a single legal entity with a limited recipient status; or

    (B) 25 members or less, then Reclamation treats that organization and every subdivision under that organization as a single legal entity with a qualified recipient status.

    (c)  (1) Religious or charitable organizations and each of their subdivisions are treated as separate prior law corporations, if neither the district nor that religious or charitable organization or its subdivisions elect to conform to the discretionary provisions.

    (2) Reclamation will treat the entire organization, including all subdivisions, as a single prior law corporation, if the central organization or any subdivisions do not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (d)  Reclamation permits a subdivision of a religious or charitable organization to retain its status as an individual entity while cooperating with a more central organization of the same affiliation in farm operation and management. Reclamation permits affiliated farm management regardless of whether the subdivision is the owner of the land being operated.

    § 426.10   Public entities.

#### § § 426.10

    (a)  Reclamation does not subject public entities to the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law with respect to land that Reclamation determines public entities farm primarily for nonrevenue producing functions. However, public entities are required to meet certification and reporting requirements as specified in § 426.18.

    (b)  Reclamation does not require public entities to seek price approval before they sell nonexempt lands. Once sold, Reclamation can make irrigation water available to such land if the purchaser meets RRA eligibility requirements.

    (c)  Public entities can lease irrigation land that they own or control to eligible landholders. Land leased from a public entity counts towards the lessee's ownership and nonfull-cost entitlement.

    § 426.11   Class 1 equivalency.

#### § § 426.11

    (a)  Class 1 equivalency determinations will establish, on a district-wide basis, the acreage of land with lower productive potential (Classes 2, 3, and 4) that would be equivalent in productive potential to the most suitable land (Class 1) in the local agricultural economic setting.

    (1) Reclamation establishes equivalency factors by comparing the weighted average farm size required to produce a given level of income on each of the lower classes of land with the farm size required to produce that income level on Class 1 land.

    (2) For equivalency purposes, Reclamation will classify all irrigable land as Class 1, 2, or 3; no other classifications are permissible for irrigable land. Class 4 and special-use land classes will be allocated to one of these three classes on a case-by-case basis.

    (3) Once the Class 1 equivalency determinations have been made, individual landowners with land classified as 2 or 3 for equivalency purposes will have the right to adjust their actual landholding acreage to its Class 1 equivalent acreage.

    (4) In a district subject to prior law, Class 1 equivalency can be applied only to landholders who are subject to the discretionary provisions.

    (5) Requests for equivalency determinations will be scheduled by region, with the regional director of each Reclamation region having responsibility for such scheduling. Generally, requests will be honored on a first-come-first-served basis. However, if requests exceed the region's ability to fulfill them expeditiously, priority will be given on the basis of greatest immediate need.

    (b)  Only districts may request Class 1 equivalency determinations. Upon the request of any district subject to the acreage limitation provisions, Reclamation will make a Class 1 equivalency determination for that district. Equivalency determinations can be made only on a district-wide basis.

    (c)  Class 1 land is defined and will be classified as that irrigable land within a particular agricultural economic setting that:

    (i) Most completely meets the various parameters and specifications established by Reclamation for irrigable land classes;

    (ii) Has the relatively highest level of suitability for continuous, successful irrigation farming; and

    (iii) Is estimated to have the highest relative productive potential measured in terms of net income per acre (reflecting both productivity and costs of production). The equivalency analysis will establish the acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in productive potential (measured in terms of net farm income) to 1 acre of Class 1 land.

    (2) All land that Reclamation has not classified, or for which Reclamation has not yet performed the necessary economic studies, will be considered Class 1 land for the purposes of determining entitlements under these rules until such time as the necessary classifications or studies have been completed.

    (d)  The extent and location of Class 1 land and land in lower land classes in a district have been, or will be, determined by Reclamation.

    (1) Reclamation will take into account the influence of economic and physical factors upon the productive potential of the land lying within the district. These factors will include, but are not limited to the following and their effect on agricultural practices:

    (i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the soil;

    (ii) Topography;

    (iii) Drainage status;

    (iv) Costs of production;

    (v) Land development costs;

    (vi) Water quality and adequacy;

    (vii) Elevation;

    (viii) Crop adaptability; and

    (ix) Length of growing season.

    (2) Acceptable levels of detail for land classification studies to be utilized in making Class 1 equivalency determinations for a given district will be evaluated on the basis of the physical and agricultural economic characteristics of the area. For districts where the sole purpose of the land classification study is for a Class 1 equivalency determination, the level of detail of the land classification to be made will never be greater than that required to make a Class 1 equivalency determination.

    (3) Reclamation will pay for at least a portion of the costs associated with the land classification study. The amount to be paid by Reclamation will be determined as follows:

    (i) Reclamation has provided basic land classification data as part of the project development process since 1924. Accordingly, if Reclamation determines that acceptable land classification data are not available for making requested Class 1 equivalency determinations and if the project was authorized for construction since 1924, such data will be made available at Reclamation's expense; or

    (ii) For each district located in projects authorized for construction prior to 1924, Reclamation will pay 50 percent of the costs and the district must pay 50 percent of the costs of new land classification studies required to make accurate Class 1 equivalency determinations.

    (4) When basic land classification data are available for a district, but the district does not agree with the accuracy or asserts that the data have become outdated, the district may request, and Reclamation may perform, a reclassification under the authority contained in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 485), with the following conditions:

    (i) The requesting district will pay 50 percent of the costs of performing such reclassifications and 100 percent of the costs of all other studies involved in the equivalency process; and

    (ii) The results of such reclassifications will be binding upon the requesting district and Reclamation.

    (e)  Economic studies related to Class 1 equivalency determinations will measure net farm income by land classes within the district.

    (1) Net farm income will be determined by considering the disposable income accruing to the farm operator's labor, management, and equity from the sale of farm crops and livestock produced on irrigated land, after all fixed and variable costs of production, including costs of irrigation service, are accounted for.

    (2) Net farm income will be the measure of productivity to establish equivalency factors reflecting the acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in productive potential to 1 acre of Class 1 land.

    (3) The cost of performing new or additional economic studies and computations inherent in the equivalency process will be the responsibility of the requesting district.

    (f)  Class 1 land and land in lower classes will be identified on a district basis by Reclamation using a standard approach in which the land classification for the entire district is considered. Equivalency factors will then be computed for the district and applied to specific tracts within individual landholdings. If adequate land classification data are not available, they will be developed as specified in paragraph (d) of this section using standard procedures established by Reclamation.

    (1) For purposes of ownership entitlement, Class 1 equivalency will not be applied until a final determination has been made by Reclamation concerning the district's request for equivalency.

    (i) Reclamation will protect excess landowners' property interests by ensuring that equivalency determinations are completed in advance of maturity dates on recordable contracts, provided the district requests an equivalency determination at least 6 months prior to the maturity of the recordable contract, the district fulfills its obligations under this section, and the district notifies Reclamation 6 months in advance of the maturity dates for the need for an expedited review.

    (ii) Once the determination has been made, owners of land subject to recordable contracts may withdraw land from such recordable contracts in order to reach their ownership entitlement in Class 1 equivalent acreage.

    (iii) The requirement that land under recordable contract be sold at a price approved by Reclamation does not apply to land which is withdrawn from a recordable contract and included as part of a landowner's nonexcess landholding as a result of an equivalency determination.

    (iv) In cases of equivalency determination disputes, Reclamation will not undertake the sale of the reasonable increment of the excess land under a matured recordable contract which could be affected by a reclassification, provided the dispute is determined by Reclamation not to be an attempt to thwart the sale of excess land.

    (2) For purposes of nonfull-cost entitlement, Class 1 equivalency will not be applied until a final determination has been made by Reclamation on a district's request for equivalency.

    (i) During the time when such determinations are pending, the full-cost rate will be assessed based on a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement as determined in the absence of Class 1 equivalency.

    (ii) Following Reclamation's final determination, Reclamation will reimburse the district for any full-cost charges that would not have been assessed had Class 1 equivalency been in place from the date of the district's request. Districts will return such reimbursements to the appropriate landholders.

    (3) A landholder with holdings in more than one district is entitled to equivalency only in those districts which have requested equivalency (or are already subject to equivalency). That part of the landholding in a district or districts not requesting equivalency will be counted as Class 1 land for purposes of overall entitlement.

    (g)  In districts where equivalency was a provision of project authorization, those equivalency factor determinations will be honored as originally calculated unless the district requests a reclassification.

    § 426.12   Excess land.

#### § § 426.12

    (a)  If a landowner owns more land than the landowner's ownership entitlement, all of the landowner's nonexempt land must be designated as excess and nonexcess as follows:

    (1) The landowner designates which land is excess and which is nonexcess in accordance with the instructions on the appropriate certification or reporting forms; or

    (2) If a landowner fails to designate his or her land as excess or nonexcess on the appropriate certification or reporting forms:

    (i) And all of the landowner's nonexempt land is in only one district:

    (A) If the district's contract with Reclamation includes designation procedures, then the land is designated according to those procedures; or

    (B) If the district's contract with Reclamation does not include designation procedures, then:

    () Reclamation will notify the landowner and the district that the landowner must designate the land as excess and nonexcess on the appropriate certification or reporting forms within 30-calendar days of the notification;

    () If the landowner fails to make the designation within 30-calendar days of notification, the district will make the designation within 30-calendar days thereafter; or

    () If the district does not make the designation within its _3_0-calendar days, Reclamation will make the designation; or

    (ii) If the landowner owns nonexempt land in more than one district, then Reclamation will notify the landowner and the districts that the landowner has 60-calendar days from the date of notification to make the designation. If the landowner does not make the designation in the 60-calendar days, Reclamation will make the designation.

    (b)  (1) Landowners must file with the district(s) in which the land is located and with Reclamation the designation of excess and nonexcess land. The designation of land as excess is binding on the land. However, the landowner may change the designation under the following circumstances without Reclamation's approval if:

    (i) The excess land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water because the landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions as provided in § 426.3;

    (ii) A recordable contract is amended to remove excess land when the landowner's entitlement increases because the landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions as provided in paragraph (j)(5) of this section; or

    (iii) The excess land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water as a result of Class 1 equivalency determinations, as provided in § 426.11.

    (2) No other redesignation of excess land is allowable without the approval of Reclamation in accordance with established Reclamation procedures. Reclamation will not approve a redesignation request if:

    (i) The purpose of the redesignation is for achieving, through repeated redesignation, an effective farm size in excess of that permitted by Federal reclamation law; or

    (ii) The landowner sells some or all of his or her land that is currently classified as nonexcess.

    (3) When a redesignation involves an exchange of nonexcess land for excess land, a landowner must make an equal exchange of acreage (or Class 1 equivalent acreage) through the redesignation.

    (c)  (1) If a landowner owned irrigable land on the execution date of the district's first water service or repayment contract, and the execution date was on or before October 12, 1982, the landowner's excess land is ineligible until the landowner:

    (i) Becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the landowner designates the excess land, up to his or her ownership entitlement, as nonexcess as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;

    (ii) Places such excess land under a recordable contract, provided the period for executing recordable contracts under the district's contract has not expired;

    (iii) Sells or transfers such excess land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation; or

    (iv) Redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (2) If the landowner owned irrigable land on the execution date of the district's first water service or repayment contract and the execution date is after October 12, 1982, the landowner's excess land is ineligible until the landowner:

    (i) Places such excess land under a recordable contract, provided the period for executing recordable contracts under the district's contract has not expired;

    (ii) Sells or transfers such excess land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation; or

    (iii) Redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (d)  (1) If a landowner acquires land after the date the district first entered into a repayment or water service contract that was nonexcess to the previous owner and is excess to the acquiring landowner, the first repayment or water service contract was executed on or before October 12, 1982, and:

    (i) Irrigation water was physically available when the landowner acquires such land, then the land is ineligible to receive such water until:

    (A) The landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the landowner designates the excess land, up to his or her ownership entitlement, as nonexcess as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;

    (B) The landowner sells or transfers such land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation;

    (C) The sale from the previous landowner is canceled; or

    (D) The landowner redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

    (ii) Irrigation water was not physically available when the landowner acquired the land, then the land is ineligible to receive water until:

    (A) The landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the landowner designates the excess land, up to his or her ownership entitlement, as nonexcess as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;

    (B) The landowner sells or transfers the land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation;

    (C) The sale from the previous landowner is canceled;

    (D) The landowner places the land under recordable contract when water becomes available; or

    (E) The landowner redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (2) If a landowner acquires land after the date the district first entered into a repayment or water service contract that was nonexcess to the previous owner and is excess to the acquiring landowner, the first repayment or water service contract was executed after October 12, 1982, and:

    (i) Irrigation water was physically available when the landowner acquired such land, then the land is ineligible until:

    (A) The landowner sells or transfers the land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation;

    (B) The sale from the previous landowner is canceled; or

    (C) The landowner redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

    (ii) Irrigation water was not physically available when the landowner acquired such land, then the land is ineligible to receive water until:

    (A) The landowner sells or transfers the land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation;

    (B) The sale from the previous landowner is canceled;

    (C) The landowner redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

    (D) The landowner places the land under recordable contract when water becomes available.

    (e)  (1) If the district had a contract with Reclamation on or before October 12, 1982, and eligible land became excess because the landowner's entitlement changed from being based on a district-by-district basis to a westwide basis, then such formerly eligible land is ineligible until:

    (i) The landowner places such land under recordable contract. The recordable contract does not need to include the sales price approval clause and application of the deed covenant provision will not be required; or

    (ii) The landowner sells or transfers such land to an eligible buyer. The sales price does not need Reclamation's approval.

    (2) If the district had a contract with Reclamation on or before October 12, 1982, and the landowner was a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, who directly held eligible land and such land is no longer eligible to receive water, then such formerly eligible land is ineligible until:

    (i) The landowner places such land under recordable contract. The recordable contract does not need to include the sales price approval clause and application of the deed covenant provision will not be required; or

    (ii) The landowner sells or transfers such land to an eligible buyer. The sales price does not need Reclamation's approval.

    (3) If the district first entered a contract with Reclamation after October 12, 1982, and land would have been eligible before October 12, 1982, but is now ineligible because the landowner is a direct landholder and either a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, then such land that would have been eligible remains ineligible until:

    (i) If the landowner acquired such land before the date of the district's contract:

    (A) The landowner places such land under a recordable contract requiring Reclamation sales price approval; or

    (B) Sells or transfers the land to an eligible buyer subject to Reclamation sales price approval; or

    (ii) If the landowner acquired such land after the date of the district's contract, the landowner sells or transfers such land to an eligible buyer subject to Reclamation sales price approval.

    (4) Eligible nonexcess land that is indirectly owned on or before December 18, 1996 by a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, and that becomes ineligible because of § 426.8 is ineligible until:

    (i) The landowner places such land under recordable contract. The recordable contract does not need to include the sales price approval clause and application of the deed covenant provision will not be required; or

    (ii) The landowner sells or transfers such land to an eligible buyer. The sales price does not need Reclamation's approval.

    (f)  If a landowner acquires land that is subject to Reclamation price approval, without obtaining such approval, the land is ineligible to receive water until:

    (1) The sales price is reformed to conform to the price approved by Reclamation and is eligible to receive irrigation water in the landowner's ownership entitlement; or

    (2) Such landowner sells or transfers the land to an eligible buyer at a price approved by Reclamation.

    (g)  Districts may not make available irrigation water to excess land disposed of by a landholder at a price approved by Reclamation, whether or not under a recordable contract, if the landholder subsequently becomes a direct or indirect landholder of that land through either a voluntary or involuntary action, unless:

    (1) The landholder became or contracted to become a direct or indirect landholder of that land prior to December 18, 1996, and the land in question is otherwise eligible to receive irrigation water;

    (2) Such land becomes exempt from the acreage limitations of Federal reclamation law;

    (3) The landholder pays the full-cost rate for any irrigation water delivered to the landholder's formerly excess land that is otherwise eligible to receive irrigation water. If a landholder is a part owner of a legal entity that becomes the direct or indirect landholder of the land in question, then the full-cost rate will be applicable to the proportional share of irrigation water delivered to the land that reflects the part owner's interest in that legal entity; or

    (4) The deed covenant associated with the sale has expired as provided for in paragraph (i) of this section.

    (h)  Reclamation will charge the following for irrigation water delivered to ineligible excess land in violation of Federal reclamation law and these regulations:

    (1) The appropriate compensation rate for irrigation water delivered; and

    (2) any other applicable fees as specified in § 426.20.

    (i)  (1) All land that is acquired from excess status after October 12, 1982, must have the following covenant (that runs with the land) placed in the deed transferring the land to the acquiring party in order for the land to be eligible to receive irrigation water except as otherwise specified in these regulations. The covenant must be in the deed regardless of whether or not the land was under recordable contract.

    (2) A landholder may purchase or otherwise voluntarily acquire into nonexcess status, land subject to a deed covenant, at a price approved by Reclamation if the land is within the landholder's ownership entitlement.

    (3) Upon expiration of the terms of the deed covenant, a landowner may resell such land at fair market value. A landowner may not sell more of such land in his or her lifetime than an amount equal to his or her ownership entitlement. Once the landowner reaches this limit, any additional excess land or land subject to a deed covenant the landowner acquires is ineligible to receive irrigation water, until such land is sold to an eligible buyer at a price approved by Reclamation.

    (4) If a landholder acquires land burdened by such a deed covenant through involuntary foreclosure or similar involuntary process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of a debt, including, but not limited to, a mortgage, real estate contract, or deed of trust, inheritance, or devise, and is not the party whose excess ownership originally required placement of the deed covenant, then Reclamation must terminate the deed covenant upon the landholder's request. The provisions in paragraph (i)(1)(v) of this section and § 426.14(e) address termination of deed covenants for landholders whose excess ownership originally required placement of the deed covenant.

    (j) —(1)  A landowner can make excess land eligible to receive irrigation water by entering into a recordable contract with the United States if the landowner qualifies under applicable provisions of:

    (i) The district's contract with Reclamation;

    (ii) Federal reclamation law; and

    (iii) These regulations.

    (2)  A recordable contract must include:

    (i) A clause whereby the landowner agrees to dispose of the excess land to an eligible buyer, excluding mineral rights and easements, under terms and conditions of the sale, in accordance with § 426.13; and within the period allowed for the disposition of excess land, that must be within 5 years from the date that the recordable contract is executed by Reclamation (except for the Central Arizona Project wherein the time period is 10 years from the date water becomes available to the land); and

    (ii) A clause granting power of attorney to Reclamation to sell the land held under the recordable contract, if the landholder has not already sold the land by the recordable contract's maturation.

    (3)  Reclamation can make available irrigation water to land that the landowner plans to place under a recordable contract on the day that Reclamation receives the landowner's written request to execute a recordable contract. The landowner has 20-working days in which to execute the recordable contract from the date Reclamation sends the recordable contract to the landowner. Reclamation, in its discretion, may extend this period upon the landowner's request.

    (4)  The rate for irrigation water delivered to land placed under recordable contract will be determined as follows:

    (i) If both the landowner and any lessee are prior law recipients, land placed under a recordable contract can receive irrigation water at a contract rate that does not cover full operation and maintenance (O&M) costs;

    (ii) If either landowner or any lessee is subject to the discretionary provisions, the water rate applicable to the recordable contract must cover, at a minimum, all O&M costs; or

    (iii) If a landholder leases land subject to a recordable contract and is in excess of his or her nonfull-cost entitlement, the lessee may select such land as the land on which the full-cost rate will be charged for the delivery of irrigation water, unless the land is already subject to the full-cost rate because of an extended recordable contract.

    (5)  (i) Reclamation permits a landowner to amend a recordable contract to transfer land out of a recordable contract to nonexcess status, if:

    (A) The landowner has an increased ownership entitlement because of becoming subject to the discretionary provisions; or

    (B) Land becomes eligible by implementation of Class 1 equivalency, if the landowner amends the recordable contract prior to performance of appraisal.

    (ii) Landholders must receive Reclamation's approval to amend recordable contracts.

    (A) The disposition period for any land remaining under a recordable contract will not change because of an amendment to remove some land.

    (B) For land removed from a recordable contract based on paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, any requirement for application of a deed covenant will no longer be applicable.

    (6)  If the landowner does not dispose of the excess land held under recordable contract within the period specified in the recordable contract, Reclamation will sell that land. Reclamation will not sell the land if the landowner complies with all requirements for sale of excess land under these rules within the period specified, regardless if Reclamation gives final approval of the sale within that period or after.

    (7)  Reclamation can make available irrigation water at the current applicable rate, pursuant to paragraph (j)(4) of this section, to excess land held under a matured recordable contract until Reclamation sells the land.

    (8)  If Reclamation must sell excess land, the following procedures will be used:

    (i) If Reclamation determines it to be necessary, a qualified surveyor will make a land survey. The United States will pay for the survey initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land;

    (ii) Reclamation will appraise the value of the excess land, in the manner prescribed by § 426.13, to determine the appropriate sales price. The United States will pay for the appraisal initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land; and

    (iii) Reclamation will advertise the sale of the property in farm journals and in newspapers within the county in which the land lies, and by other public notices as deemed advisable. The United States will pay for the advertisements and notices initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land. The notices must state:

    (A) The minimum acceptable sales price for the property (which equals the appraised value plus the cost of the appraisal, survey, and advertising);

    (B) That Reclamation will sell the land by auction for cash, or on terms acceptable to the landowner, to the highest eligible bidder whose bid equals or exceeds the minimum acceptable sales price; and

    (C) The date of the sale (which must not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the advertisement and notices);

    (iv) The proceeds from the sale of the land will be paid:

    (A) First, to the landowner in the amount of the appraised value;

    (B) Second, to the United States for costs of the survey, appraisal, advertising, etc.; and

    (C) Third, any remaining proceeds will be credited to the Reclamation fund or other funds as prescribed by law; and

    (v) Reclamation will close the sale of the excess land when parties complete all sales arrangements. Reclamation will execute a deed conveying the land to the purchaser. Reclamation will not require the purchaser to include a covenant in the deed, as specified in paragraph (i) of this section, that restricts any further resale of the land.

    § 426.13   Excess land appraisals.

#### § § 426.13

    (a)  Reclamation appraises excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant upon a landowner's request or when required by Reclamation. If a landowner does not request an appraisal within 6 months of the maturity date of a recordable contract, Reclamation, in its discretion, can initiate the appraisal.

    (b)  Reclamation complies with the following procedures to determine the sale price of excess land and land burdened by a deed covenant, except if a landholder owns land subject to a recordable contract that was in force on October 12, 1982, or other pertinent contract that was in force on that date, and these regulations would be inconsistent with provisions in such a contract:

    (1)  Reclamation will base all appraisals of land on the fair market value of the land at the time of appraisal without reference to the construction of the irrigation works. Reclamation must use standard appraisal procedures including: the income, comparable sales, and cost methods, as applicable. Reclamation will consider nonproject water supply factors as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section as appropriate; and

    (2)  Reclamation will assess the contributory fair market value of improvements to land, as of the date of appraisal, using standard appraisal procedures.

    (c)  (1) The appraiser will consider nonproject water supply factors, where appropriate, including:

    (i) Ground water pumping lift;

    (ii) Surface water supply;

    (iii) Water quality; and

    (iv) Trends associated with paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, where appropriate.

    (2) Reclamation will develop the nonproject water supply and trend information with the assistance of:

    (i) The district in which the land is located, if the district desires to participate;

    (ii) Landowners of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant and prospective buyers who submit information either to the district or Reclamation; and

    (iii) Public meetings and forums, at the discretion of Reclamation.

    (3) Data submitted may include:

    (i) Historic geologic data;

    (ii) Changing crops and cropping patterns; and

    (iii) Other factors associated with the nonproject water supply.

    (4) If Reclamation and the district cannot reach agreement on the nonproject water supply information within 60-calendar days, Reclamation will review and update the trend information as it deems necessary and make all final determinations considering the data provided by Reclamation and the district. Reclamation will provide these data to the appraisers who must consider the data in the appraisal process, and clearly explain how they used the data in the valuation of the land.

    (d)  The date of the appraisal will be the date of last inspection by the appraiser(s) unless there is a prior signed instrument, such as an option, contract for sale, agreement for sale, etc., affecting the property. In those cases, the date of appraisal will be the date of such instrument.

    (e)  If the appraisal is:

    (1) The land's first appraisal, the United States will initially pay the costs of appraising the value of the land, but such costs will be added to the approved sale price for the land. The United States will reimburse itself for these costs from the sale of the land;

    (2) Not the land's first appraisal, the landowner requesting the appraisal must pay any costs associated with the reappraisal, unless the value set by the reappraisal differs by more than 10 percent, in which case the United States will pay for the reappraisal; or

    (3) Associated with a sales price reformation as specified in § 426.12(f)(1), the landowner requesting the appraisal must pay any costs associated with the appraisal.

    (f)  Reclamation will select a qualified appraiser to appraise the excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant, except as specified within paragraph (g) of this section.

    (g)  The landowner who requested the appraisal may request that the United States conduct a second appraisal of the excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant if the landowner disagrees with the first appraisal. The second appraisal will be prepared by a panel of three qualified appraisers, one designated by the United States, one designated by the district, and the third designated jointly by the first two. The appraisal made by the panel will fix the maximum value of the excess land and will be binding on both parties after review and approval as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.

    (h)  Reclamation will review all appraisals of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant for:

    (1) Technical accuracy and compliance with these rules and regulations;

    (2) Applicable portions of the “Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition-Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1973,” as revised in 1992;

    (3) Reclamation policy; and

    (4) Any detailed instructions provided by Reclamation setting conditions applicable to an individual appraisal.

    § 426.14   Involuntary acquisition of land.

#### § § 426.14

    (a)  means a commercial bank or trust company, a private bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank in the United States, a thrift institution, an insurance company, a loan or finance company, or the Farm Credit System.

    means land that is acquired through an involuntary foreclosure or similar involuntary process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of a debt (including, but not limited to, a mortgage, real estate contract or deed of trust), inheritance, or devise.

    (b)  Reclamation cannot make available irrigation water to land that was ineligible excess land before the new landowner involuntarily acquired it, unless:

    (1) The land becomes nonexcess in the new landowner's ownership; and

    (2) The deed to the land contains the 10-year covenant requiring Reclamation sale price approval, and that deed commences when the land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water.

    (3) If either of these conditions is not met, the land remains ineligible excess until sold to an eligible buyer at an approved price, and the seller places the 10-year covenant requiring Reclamation price approval, as specified in § 426.12(i), in the deed transferring title to the land to the buyer.

    (c)  Reclamation can make available irrigation water to land held under a recordable contract that is involuntarily acquired under the terms of the recordable contract to the extent the land continues to be excess in his or her landholding, if the landowner:

    (1) Assumes the recordable contract; and

    (2) Executes an assumption agreement provided by Reclamation.

    (3) This land will remain eligible to receive irrigation water for the longer of 5 years from the date that the land was involuntarily acquired, or for the remainder of the recordable contract period. The sale of this land shall be under terms and conditions set forth in the recordable contract and must be satisfactory to and at a price approved by Reclamation.

    (d)  Reclamation treats mortgaged land that changed from nonexcess status to excess status after the mortgage was recorded, and which is subsequently acquired by a lender through an involuntary foreclosure or similar process of law, or by a bona fide conveyance in satisfaction of a mortgage, in the following manner:

    (1) If the new landowner designates the land as excess in his or her holding, then:

    (i) The land is eligible to receive irrigation water for a period of 5 years or until transferred to an eligible landowner, whichever occurs first;

    (ii) During the 5-year period Reclamation will charge a rate for irrigation water equal to the rate paid by the former owner, unless the land becomes subject to full-cost pricing through leasing; and

    (iii) The land is eligible for sale at its fair market value without a deed covenant restricting its future sales price; or

    (2) If the new landowner is eligible to designate the land as nonexcess and he or she designates the land as nonexcess, the land will be treated in the same manner as any other nonexcess land and will be eligible for sale at its fair market value without a deed covenant restricting its future sales price.

    (e)  (1) Reclamation can make irrigation water available for a period of 5 years to a landowner who involuntarily acquires land that becomes excess in the involuntarily acquiring landowner's holding provided the land was nonexcess to the previous owner and:

    (i) The acquiring landowner never previously held such land as ineligible excess land or under a recordable contract;

    (ii) The acquiring landholder is a financial institution; or

    (iii) The acquiring landowner previously held the land as ineligible excess or under a recordable contract and § 426.12(g)(1), (3), or (4) applies.

    (2) The following will be applicable in situations that meet the criteria specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section:

    (i) Reclamation will charge a rate for irrigation water delivered to such land equal to the rate paid by the former owner, except Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate if:

    (A) The land becomes subject to full-cost pricing through leasing; or

    (B) If the involuntarily acquired land is eligible to receive irrigation water only because § 426.12(g)(3) applies and the deed covenant has not expired;

    (ii) The new landowner may not place such land under a recordable contract;

    (iii) The new landowner may request that Reclamation remove a deed covenant as provided in § 426.12(i)(4), and may sell such land at any time without price approval and without the deed covenant. However, the deed covenant will not be removed and the terms of the deed covenant will be fully applied if the new landowner is the landowner who sold the land in question from excess status, except for:

    (A) Financial institutions; or

    (B) Landowners for which § 426.12(g) (1) or (2) apply; and

    (iv) Such land will become ineligible to receive irrigation water 5 years after it was acquired and will remain ineligible until sold to an eligible buyer or redesignated as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.

    (f)  Landholders who designate involuntarily acquired land as excess as provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section and want to redesignate the land as nonexcess, must utilize the redesignation process specified under § 426.12(b)(2).

    (1) However, such redesignations will not be approved if the water rate specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) or (e)(2)(i) of this section is less than what would have been charged for water deliveries to the land in question if the landholder that involuntarily acquired the land had originally designated the land as nonexcess.

    (2) Such landholders may utilize the redesignation process, if they remit to Reclamation the difference between the rate paid and the rate that would have been paid, if the land had been designated as nonexcess when involuntarily acquired, for all irrigation water delivered to the land in question while the land was designated as excess.

    (g)  A landowner does not automatically become subject to the discretionary provisions if the landowner acquires irrigation land involuntarily which was formerly subject to the discretionary provisions. However, a landholder that is subject to the prior law provisions will become subject to the discretionary provisions upon involuntarily acquiring land if:

    (1) The land is located in a district that is subject to the discretionary provisions;

    (2) The landholder in question will be the direct landowner of the land; and

    (3) The landholder in question declares the land as nonexcess.

    (h)  If a landowner receives irrigation land through inheritance or devise, the 5-year eligibility period for receiving irrigation water on the newly acquired land per paragraphs (c)(3) and (e) of this section begins on the date of the previous landowner's death.

    § 426.15   Commingling.

#### § § 426.15

    (a) :

    means irrigation water and nonproject water that use the same facilities.

    (b)  If a district entered into a contract with Reclamation prior to October 1, 1981, and that contract has provisions addressing commingled water situations, those provisions stay in effect for the term of that contract and any renewals of it.

    (c)  New, amended, or renewed contracts may provide that irrigation water can be commingled with nonproject water as follows:

    (1) If the facilities used for the commingling of irrigation water and nonproject water are constructed without funds made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will apply only to the landholders who receive irrigation water, provided:

    (i) That the water requirements for eligible lands can be established; and

    (ii) The quantity of irrigation water to be used is less than or equal to the quantity necessary to irrigate eligible lands.

    (2) If the facilities used for commingling irrigation water and nonproject water are funded with monies made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law, landholders who receive nonproject water will be subject to Federal reclamation law and these regulations unless:

    (i) The district collects and pays to the United States an incremental fee which reasonably reflects an appropriate share of the cost to the Federal Government, including interest, of storing or delivering the nonproject water; and

    (ii) The fee will be established by Reclamation and will be in addition to the district's obligation to pay for capital, operation, maintenance, and replacement costs associated with the facilities required to provide the service.

    (3) If paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section are met, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will be applicable to only those landholders who receive irrigation water. Accordingly, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will not be applicable to landholders who receive nonproject water delivered through facilities funded with monies made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law if those paragraphs are met.

    (d)  Federal reclamation law and these regulations do not apply to landholders receiving irrigation water from federally financed facilities if the irrigation water is acquired by an exchange and that exchange results in no material benefit to the recipient of the irrigation water.

    § 426.16   Exemptions and exclusions.

#### § § 426.16

    (a)  (1) If Reclamation determines that land receives its agricultural water from a Corps project, Reclamation will exempt that land from specific provisions of Federal reclamation law, including the RRA, unless:

    (i) Federal law explicitly designates, integrates, or incorporates that land into a Federal Reclamation project; or

    (ii) Reclamation provides project works for the control or conveyance of the agricultural water supply from the Corps project to that land.

    (2) Upon such determination, Reclamation will:

    (i) Notify the district of its exemption status;

    (ii) Require the district's agricultural water users to continue, under contracts made with Reclamation, to repay their share of construction, operation and maintenance, and contract administration costs of the Corps project allocated to conservation or irrigation storage; and

    (iii) At the request of the district delete provisions of the district's repayment or water service contract that imposes acreage limitation for those lands served by Corps projects.

    (b)  The acreage limitation provisions do not apply to land in a district after the district has repaid, in accordance with the district's contract with Reclamation, all obligated construction costs for project facilities.

    (1) Payments by periodic installments over the contract repayment term, as well as lump-sum and accelerated payments, if allowed by the district's contract with Reclamation, will qualify the district to become exempt.

    (2) If a district has a contract with the United States providing for individual landowner repayment of construction charges allocated to land, and the landowner has repaid all obligated construction costs allocated for that landowner's land, that landowner will become exempt from the acreage limitation provisions.

    (3) Upon payout Reclamation will:

    (i) Notify the district, and individual landowner in cases of individual landowner payout, of the exemption from the acreage limitation provisions;

    (ii) Notify the district or individual landowner that the exemption does not relieve the district or individual landowner of the obligation to continue to pay, on an annual basis, O&M costs applicable to the district or landowner;

    (iii) Upon request by the owner of land for which repayment has occurred, provide a certificate from Reclamation acknowledging that the land is free of the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law;

    (iv) Except as provided for in § 426.19(e), no longer apply the certification and reporting requirements to the district, if the entire district is exempt, or to exempt landowners as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

    (v) Consider on a case-by-case basis continuation of the exemption if additional construction funds for the project are requested.

    (c)  If Reclamation makes a Rehabilitation and Betterment loan (pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Betterment Act of October 7, 1949, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 504) to a project that was authorized under Federal reclamation law prior to the submittal of the loan request, by or for the district, Reclamation:

    (1) Considers the loan as a loan for maintenance, including replacements that cannot be financed currently;

    (2) Does not consider the loan in determining whether the district has discharged its obligation to repay the construction cost of project facilities used to make irrigation water available for delivery to land in the district; and

    (3) Will not allow such a loan to serve as the basis for reinstating acreage limitation provisions in a district that has completed payment of its construction obligation, nor serve as the basis for increasing the construction obligation of the district and thereby extending the period during which acreage limitation provisions will apply.

    (d)  If Reclamation announces availability of temporary supplies of water resulting from an unusually large water supply, not otherwise storable for project purposes, or from infrequent and otherwise unmanaged floodflows of short duration a district may request that Reclamation make such supplies available to excess land. However, such water deliveries must not have an adverse effect on other authorized project purposes. Upon approval of the district's request, Reclamation will notify the requesting district of the availability of the temporary supply of water under the following conditions:

    (1) The contract for the temporary supply of water will be for 1 year or less in accordance with prior policies and practices;

    (2) The acreage limitation provisions will not be applicable to the temporary supply of water;

    (3) An applicable price for the water, if any, will be established; and

    (4) Such other conditions as Reclamation may include.

    (e)  If a landowner requests that Reclamation determine that portions of his or her owned land are isolated tracts that can be farmed economically only if included in a farming operation that already exceeds the landowners ownership entitlement, and Reclamation makes such a determination, then Reclamation:

    (1) Will exempt such land from the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law; and

    (2) Will assess the full-cost rate for any irrigation water delivered to the isolated tract that exceeds the landowner's nonfull-cost entitlement.

    (f)  (1) Indian trust or restricted lands are excluded from application of the acreage limitation provisions.

    (2) Indian tribes and tribal entities operating on Indian trust or restricted lands are excluded from application of the water conservation provisions.

    § 426.17   Small reclamation projects.

#### § § 426.17

    (a)  (1) If a district entered into a loan contract under the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422) (SRPA) on or after October 12, 1982, the contract is subject to the provisions of the SRPA, as amended by Section 223 of the RRA and as amended by Title III of Pub. L. 99-546.

    (2) If a district entered into an SRPA loan contract prior to October 12, 1982, and the district:

    (i) Did not amend the loan contract to conform to the SRPA, as amended by Section 223 of the RRA, prior to October 27, 1986, then the acreage provisions of the contract continue in effect, unless the contract is amended to conform to the SRPA as amended by section 307 of Pub. L. 99-546.

    (ii) Amended the loan contract to conform to the SRPA, as amended by Section 223 of the RRA, prior to October 27, 1986, the contract is subject to the increased acreage provisions provided in Section 223 of the RRA. Reclamation cannot alter, modify or amend any other provision of the SRPA loan contract without the consent of the non-Federal party.

    (b)  No other sections of these regulations apply to SRPA loans, except as specified in § 426.3(a)(3)(ii) and paragraph (d) of this section.

    (c)  If a district has a water service or repayment contract in addition to an SRPA contract, Reclamation does not consider the SRPA loan:

    (1) In determining whether the district has discharged its construction cost obligation for the project facilities;

    (2) As a basis for reinstating acreage limitation provisions in a district that has completed payment of its construction cost obligation(s); or

    (3) As a basis for increasing the construction obligation of the district and extending the period during which acreage limitation provisions will apply to that district.

    (d)  If a district has an SRPA loan contract and a contract as defined in § 426.2, the SRPA contract does not supersede the RRA requirements applicable to such contracts.

    § 426.18   Landholder information requirements.

#### § § 426.18

    (a)

    means the period of time between the district's first and last water delivery in any water year.

    (b)  All landholders and other parties involved in the ownership or operation of nonexempt land must provide Reclamation, as required by these regulations or upon request, any records or information, in a form suitable to Reclamation, deemed reasonably necessary to implement the RRA or other provisions of Federal reclamation law.

    (c)  (1) Landholders who are subject to the discretionary provisions must annually submit standard certification forms, except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (2) Landholders who make an irrevocable election must submit the standard certification forms with their irrevocable election in the year that they make the election.

    (3) Landholders who are subject to prior law must annually submit standard reporting forms, except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (4) Landholders who qualify under an exemption as specified in paragraph (g) of this section need not submit any forms.

    (d)  Landholders must declare on the appropriate certification or reporting forms all nonexempt land that they hold directly or indirectly westwide and other information pertinent to their compliance with Federal reclamation law.

    (e)  Landholders must submit the appropriate, completed form(s) to each district in which they directly or indirectly hold irrigation land.

    (f)  The ultimate parent legal entity of a wholly owned subsidiary or of a series of wholly owned subsidiaries must file the required certification or reporting forms. The ultimate parent legal entity must disclose all direct and indirect landholdings of its subsidiaries as required on such forms.

    (g)  (1) A landholder is exempt from submitting the certification and reporting forms only if:

    (i) The landholder's district has Category 1 status, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, and the landholder is a:

    (A) Qualified recipient who holds a total of 240 acres westwide or less; or

    (B) Limited recipient or a prior law recipient who holds a total of 40 acres westwide or less.

    (ii) The landholder's district has Category 2 status, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, and the landholder is a:

    (A) Qualified recipient who holds a total of 80 acres westwide or less; or

    (B) Limited recipient or a prior law recipient who holds a total of 40 acres westwide or less.

    (2) A wholly owned subsidiary is exempted from submitting certification or reporting forms, if its ultimate parent legal entity has properly filed such forms disclosing the landholdings of each of its subsidiaries.

    (3) In determining whether certification or reporting is required for purposes of this section:

    (i) Class 1 equivalency factors as determined in § 426.11 shall not be used; and

    (ii) Indirect landholders need not count involuntarily acquired acreage designated as excess by the direct landowner.

    (h)  (1) For purposes of this section each district has Category 2 status, unless the following criteria have been met. If the district has met both criteria, it will be granted Category 1 status.

    (i) The district has conformed by contract to the discretionary provisions; and

    (ii) The district is current in its financial obligations to Reclamation.

    (2) Reclamation considers a district current in its financial obligation if as of September 30, the district is current in its:

    (i) Financial obligations specified in its contract(s) with Reclamation; and

    (ii) Payment obligations established by the RRA, and these rules.

    (i)  Once a district achieves Category 1 status, it will only be withdrawn if the Regional Director determines the district is not current in its financial obligations as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The withdrawal of Category 1 status will be effective at the end of the current water year and can be restored only as provided under paragraph (h) of this section. With the withdrawal of Category 1 status, the district will have a Category 2 status.

    (j)  If a qualified recipient holds land in a Category 1 district, then the 240-acre forms threshold will be applicable in determining if the landholder must submit a certification form to that Category 1 district. If the same qualified recipient also holds land in a Category 2 district, then the 80-acre forms threshold will be applicable in determining if the landholder must submit a certification form to the Category 2 district.

    (k)  If a landholder's ownership or leasing arrangements change in any way:

    (1) During the irrigation season, the landholder must:

    (i) Notify the district office, either verbally or in writing within 30-calendar days of the change; and

    (ii) Submit new forms to all districts in which the landholder holds nonexempt land, within 60-calendar days of the change.

    (2) Outside of the irrigation season, then the landholder must submit new standard certification or reporting forms to all districts in which nonexempt land is held prior to any irrigation water deliveries following such changes.

    (l)  If a landholder's ownership or leasing arrangements have not changed since last submitting a standard certification or reporting form, the landholder can satisfy the annual certification or reporting requirements by submitting a verification form instead of a standard form. On that form the landholder must verify that the information contained on the last submitted standard certification or reporting form remains accurate and complete.

    (m)  (1) If a landholder does not submit required certification or reporting form(s), then:

    (i) The district must not deliver, and the landholder is not eligible to receive and must not accept delivery of, irrigation water in any water year prior to submission of the required certification or reporting form(s) for that water year; and

    (ii) Eligibility will be regained only after all required certification or reporting forms are submitted by the landholder to the district.

    (2) If one or more part owners of a legal entity do not submit certification or reporting forms as required:

    (i) The entire entity will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until such forms are submitted; or

    (ii) If the documents forming the entity provide for the part owners' interest to be separable and alienable, then only that portion of the land attributable to the noncomplying part owners will be ineligible to receive irrigation water.

    (n)  If a landholder makes a false statement on the appropriate certification or reporting form(s) Reclamation can prosecute the landholder pursuant to the following statement which is included in all certification and reporting forms:

    (o)  The information collection requirements contained in this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  and assigned control numbers 1006-0005 and 1006-0006. The information is being collected to comply with Sections 206, 224(c), and 228 of the RRA. These sections require that, as a condition to the receipt of irrigation water, each landholder in a district which is subject to the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law, as amended and supplemented by the RRA, will furnish to his or her district annually a certificate/report which indicates that he or she is in compliance with the provisions of Federal reclamation law. Completion of these forms is required to obtain the benefit of irrigation water. The information collected on each landholding will be summarized by the district and submitted to Reclamation in a form prescribed by Reclamation.

    (p)  The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552) protects the information submitted in accordance with certification and reporting requirements. As a condition to execution of a contract, Reclamation requires the inclusion of a standard contract article which provides for district compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and 43 CFR part 2, subpart D, in maintaining the landholder certification and reporting forms.

    § 426.19   District responsibilities.

#### § § 426.19

    A district that delivers irrigation water to nonexempt land under a contract with the United States must:

    (a) Provide information to landholders concerning the requirements of Federal reclamation law and these regulations;

    (b) Provide Reclamation, as required by these regulations or upon request, and in a form suitable to Reclamation, records and information as Reclamation may deem reasonably necessary to implement the RRA and other provisions of Federal reclamation law;

    (c) Be responsible for payments to Reclamation of all appropriate charges specified in these regulations. Districts must collect the appropriate charges from each landholder based on the landholder's acreage limitation status, landholdings, and entitlements, and must not average the costs over the entire district, unless the charges prove uncollectible from the responsible landholders;

    (d) Distribute, collect, and review landholder certification and reporting forms;

    (e) File and retain landholder certification and reporting forms. Districts must retain superseded landholder certification and reporting forms for 6 years; thereafter, districts may destroy such superseded forms, except:

    (1) Districts must keep on file the last fully completed standard certification or reporting form, in addition to the current verification form; or

    (2) If Reclamation specifically requests a district to retain superseded forms beyond 6 years.

    (f) Comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, with respect to landholder certification and reporting forms;

    (g) Annually summarize information provided on landholder certification and reporting forms on separate summary forms provided by Reclamation and submit these forms to Reclamation on or before the date established by the appropriate regional director;

    (h) Withhold deliveries of irrigation water to any landholder not eligible to receive irrigation water under the certification or reporting requirements or any other provision of Federal reclamation law and these regulations; and

    (i) Return to Reclamation, for deposit as a general credit to the Reclamation fund, all revenues received from the delivery of water to ineligible land. For purposes of these regulations only, this does not include revenues from any charges that may be assessed by the district to cover district operation, maintenance, and administrative expenses.

    § 426.20   Assessment of administrative costs.

#### § § 426.20

    (a)  Reclamation will assess a district administrative costs as described in paragraph (e) of this section if the district delivers irrigation water to land that was ineligible because the landholders did not submit certification or reporting forms prior to the receipt of irrigation water in accordance with § 426.18; or to ineligible excess land as provided in § 426.12.

    (1) Reclamation will apply the assessment on a yearly basis in each district for each landholder that received irrigation water in violation of § 426.18, or for each landholder that received irrigation water on ineligible land as specified above.

    (2) In applying the assessment to legal entities, compliance by an entity will be treated independently from compliance by its part owners or beneficiaries.

    (3) The assessment in paragraph (a) of this section will be applied independently of the assessment specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b)  Reclamation will assess a district for the administrative costs described in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the district provides Reclamation with requested reporting or certification form corrections within 60-calendar days of the date of Reclamation's written request. If Reclamation receives the required corrections within this 60-calendar day time period, Reclamation will consider the requirements of § 426.18 satisfied.

    (1) Reclamation will apply the assessment on a yearly basis in each district for each landholder that received irrigation water and for whom the district does not provide corrected forms within the applicable 60-calendar day time period.

    (2) In applying the assessment to legal entities, compliance by an entity will be treated independently from compliance by its part owners or beneficiaries.

    (3) The assessment in paragraph (b) of this section will be applied independently of the assessment specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c)  Districts are responsible for payment of Reclamation assessments described under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

    (d)  Reclamation will deposit to the general fund of the United States Treasury, as miscellaneous receipts, administrative costs assessed and collected under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

    (e)  The administrative costs assessment required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is set at $260. Reclamation will review the associated costs at least once every 5 years, and will adjust the assessment amount, if needed, to reflect new cost data. Notice of the revised assessment for administrative costs will be published in the  in December of the year the data are reviewed.

    § 426.21   Interest on underpayments.

#### § § 426.21

    (a)  For the purposes of this section  means the difference between what a landholder owed for the delivery of irrigation water under Federal reclamation law and what that landholder paid.

    (b)  If a landholder has incurred an underpayment, Reclamation will collect from the appropriate district such underpayment with interest. Interest accrues from the original payment due date until the district pays the amount due. The original payment due date is the date the district should have paid the United States for water delivered to the landholder.

    (c)  The Secretary of the Treasury determines the interest rate charged the district based on the weighted average yield of all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Department of the Treasury during the period of underpayment.

    § 426.22   Public participation.

#### § § 426.22

    (a)  Except for proposed contracts having a duration of 1 year or less for the sale of surplus water or interim irrigation water, Reclamation will:

    (1) Provide notice of proposed irrigation or amendatory irrigation contract actions 60-calendar days prior to contract execution by publishing announcements in general circulation newspapers in the affected area;

    (2) Issue announcements in the form of news releases, legal notices, official letters, memoranda, or other forms of written material; and

    (3) Directly notify individuals and entities who made a timely written request for such notice to the appropriate Reclamation regional or local office.

    (b)  In the event that modifications are made to a proposed contract the regional director must:

    (1) Provide copies of revised proposed contracts to all parties who requested copies of the proposed contract in response to the initial notice; and

    (2) Determine whether or not to republish the notice or to extend the comment period. The regional director must consider, among other factors:

    (i) The significance of the impact(s) of the modification to possible affected parties; and

    (ii) The interest expressed by the public over the course of contract negotiations.

    (c)  Each published announcement will include, as appropriate:

    (1) A brief description of the proposed contract terms and conditions being negotiated;

    (2) Date, time, and place of meetings, workshops, or hearings;

    (3) The address and telephone number to which inquiries and comments may be addressed to Reclamation; and

    (4) The period of time during which Reclamation will accept comments.

    (d)  Anyone can get copies of a proposed contract from the appropriate regional director or his or her designated public contact when the proposed contracts become available for review and comment, as specified in the published announcement.

    (e)  (1) Reclamation can provide, as appropriate: meetings, workshops, or hearings to provide local information. Advance notice of meetings, workshops, or hearings will be provided to those parties who make timely written request for such notice. Request for notice of meetings, workshops, or hearings should be sent to the appropriate Reclamation regional or local office.

    (2) Reclamation or the district can invite the public to observe any contract proceedings.

    (3) All public participation procedures will be coordinated with those involved with National Environmental Policy Act compliance, if Reclamation determines that the contract action may or will have “significant” environmental effects.

    (f)  Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the district may negotiate the terms and conditions of a specific contract proposal.

    (g)  (1) Reclamation will review and summarize for use by the contract approving authority, testimony presented at any public hearing or any written comments submitted to the appropriate Reclamation officials at locations and within the comment period, as specified in the advance published announcement.

    (2) Reclamation will make available to the public all written correspondence regarding proposed contracts under the terms and procedures of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended.

    § 426.23   Recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.

#### § § 426.23

    (a)  All new, amended, and renewed contracts shall provide for payment of O&M costs as specified in this section.

    (b)  If a district executes a new or renewed contract after October 12, 1982, then that district must pay all of the O&M costs that Reclamation allocates to irrigation.

    (c)  If a district has a contract executed prior to October 12, 1982, and the district amends the contract after October 12, 1982, as provided for in § 426.3(a)(2) to conform to the discretionary provisions, then the following applies:

    (1) The district must pay all of the O&M costs that Reclamation allocates to irrigation;

    (2) If in the year the amendment is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate and annually paid to the United States. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

    (3) The district will not be required to pay an increased amount toward the construction costs of a project as a condition of the district's agreeing to a contract amendment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

    (d)  If a district amends its contract after October 12, 1982, to provide supplemental or additional benefits, as provided for in § 426.3(a)(3), then the following must be complied with:

    (1) The district must pay all of the O&M costs that Reclamation allocates to irrigation;

    (2) If in the year the amendment is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate and annually paid to the United States. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

    (3) The district must pay any increases in the amount paid annually toward the construction costs of a project that the United States requires the district to pay as a condition of agreeing to provide the district with supplemental and additional benefits.

    (e)  For a district whose prior contract was executed prior to October 12, 1982, the district must pay all of the O&M costs allocated by Reclamation to irrigation unless the contract specifically provides contrary terms.

    (f)  (1) Regardless of any terms to the contrary within a prior contract with a district, a landholder who makes an irrevocable election, as provided for in § 426.3(f) must pay, annually, his or her proportionate share of all O&M costs allocated by Reclamation to irrigation. The irrevocable elector's proportionate share is based upon the ratio of:

    (i) The amount of land in the district held by the irrevocable elector that received irrigation water to the total amount of land in the district that received irrigation water; or

    (ii) The amount of irrigation water in the district received by the irrevocable elector to the total amount of irrigation water that the district delivered.

    (2) The district(s) where the irrevocable elector's landholding is located must collect from the irrevocable elector an amount equal to the irrevocable elector's proportionate share of all O&M costs allocated by Reclamation to irrigation and the following apply:

    (i) If in the year the election is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year, then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

    (ii) Such collections must be forwarded annually to the United States.

    (g)  In a district subject to prior law, if a landholder is subject to full-cost pricing the district must ensure that all O&M costs are included in any full-cost assessment, regardless of whether the landholder is subject to the discretionary provisions. The revenues from such full-cost assessments must be collected and submitted to the United States.

    § 426.24   Reclamation decisions and appeals.

#### § § 426.24

    (a) —(1)  The appropriate regional director makes any final determination that these regulations require or authorize. If Reclamation's final determination is likely to involve districts, or landholders with landholdings located in more than one region, the Commissioner designates one regional director to make that final determination.

    (2)  The appropriate regional director will transmit any final determination to any district and landholder, as appropriate, whose rights and interests are directly affected.

    (3)  A regional director's decisions will take effect the day after the expiration of the period during which a person adversely affected may file a notice of appeal unless a petition for stay is filed together with a timely notice of appeal.

    (b) —(1)  Any district or landholder whose rights and interests are directly affected by a regional director's final determination can submit a written notice of appeal. Such notice of appeal must be submitted to the Commissioner of Reclamation within 30-calendar days from the date of the regional director's final determination.

    (2)  The affected party will have 60-calendar days from the date that the regional director issues a final determination to submit a supporting brief or memorandum to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may extend the time for submitting a supporting brief or memorandum, if:

    (i) The affected party submits a request to the Commissioner in a timely manner;

    (ii) The request includes the reason why additional time is needed; and

    (iii) The Commissioner determines the appellant has shown good cause for such an extension and the extension would not prejudice Reclamation.

    (3)  (i) The Commissioner will determine whether to stay a regional director's final determination within 30 days after receiving a properly filed petition for stay if the requesting party:

    (A) Submits a request for stay in writing to the Commissioner, with, or in advance of, the notice of appeal, and states the grounds upon which the party requests the stay; and

    (B) Demonstrates that the harm that a district or landholder would suffer if the Commissioner does not grant the stay outweighs the interest of the United States in having the final determination take effect pending appeal.

    (ii) A decision, or that portion of the decision, for which a stay is not granted will become effective immediately after the Commissioner denies or partially denies the petition for stay, or fails to act within 30 days after receiving the request.

    (iii) A Commissioner's decision on a petition for a stay or any other Commissioner decision is appealable.

    (c) —(1)  A party can appeal the Commissioner's decision to the Secretary by writing to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), U.S. Department of the Interior. For an appeal to be timely, OHA must receive the appeal within 30-calendar days from the date of mailing of the Commissioner's decision.

    (2)  43 CFR part 4, subpart G, and other provisions of 43 CFR Part 4, where applicable, govern the OHA appeal process, except for the accrual of underpayment interest as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

    (d)  Reclamation will apply decisions made by the Commissioner or by OHA under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as of the date of the violation or other problem that was addressed in the regional director's final determination. If, during the appeal process, irrigation water has been delivered to land subsequently found to be ineligible, for other than RRA forms submittal violations, the compensation rate may be applied to such deliveries retroactively.

    (e)  Interest on any underpayments, as provided in § 426.21, continues to accrue during an appeal of a regional director's final determination, an appeal of the Commissioner's decision, or judicial review of final agency action. Underpayment interest accrual will continue even during a stay under paragraphs (b)(4) or (c)(3) of this section.

    (f)  (1) Appeals to the Commissioner of a regional director's final determination which were decided by the Commissioner or his or her delegate prior to the effective date of these regulations are hereby validated.

    (2) Appeals to the Commissioner of final determinations made by a regional director and appeals to OHA, which are pending on appeal as of the effective date of these regulations will be processed and decided in accordance with the regulations in effect immediately prior to the effective date of these regulations.

    (g)  All requests for stays, appeals, or other communications to the United States under this section must be addressed as follows:

    (1) Commissioner, Bureau of Reclamation, Office of Policy, Attention: D-5200, P.O. Box 25007, Denver, Colorado 80225.

    (2) Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 22203.

#### § § 428.7

    (a) If you do not submit required RRA form(s) in any water year, then:

    (1) The district must not deliver irrigation water before you submit the required RRA form(s); and

    (2) You, the trustee, or the landholder(s) who holds the land (including to whom the land held in trust is attributed) must not accept delivery of irrigation water before you submit the required RRA form(s).

    (b) After you submit all required RRA forms to the district, we will restore eligibility.

    (c) If a district delivers irrigation water to land that is ineligible because you did not submit RRA forms as required by this part, we will assess administrative costs against the district as specified in § 426.20(e) of this chapter.

    (1) The formerly excess land becomes exempt from the acreage limitations of Federal reclamation law; or

    (2) The full-cost rate is paid for any irrigation water delivered to your formerly excess land that is otherwise eligible to receive irrigation water. If you are a part owner of a legal entity that is the direct or indirect farm operator of the land in question, then the full-cost rate will apply to the proportional share of the land that reflects your interest in that legal entity.

    § 428.10   Districts' responsibilities concerning certain formerly excess land.

#### § § 428.10

    Districts must not make irrigation water available to formerly excess land that meets the criteria under § 428.9(a), unless an exception provided in § 428.9(b) applies.

    Subpart H—Prohibited and Unauthorized Uses of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies

      § 429.31   What uses are prohibited on Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies?

#### § § 429.31

      (a) Reclamation prohibits any use that would not comply with part 423 of this chapter.

      (b) Reclamation prohibits any use that would result in new private exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies as of the effective date of this part. Improvements that are within the terms and conditions of an existing authorization will not be considered new private exclusive recreational or residential use.

      § 429.32   How will Reclamation address currently authorized existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses?

#### § § 429.32

      The administration and potential renewal of use authorizations, existing as of January 1, 2008, for private exclusive recreational or residential uses of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies, as defined in this part, will be administered in accordance with the following requirements.

      (a) Existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses must be compatible with public needs and with authorized project purposes, project operations, safety, and security. A review of whether existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses is compatible with public needs and authorized project purposes, project operations, safety, and security will be made at least once every 20 years, except where part 21 requires a more frequent review.

      (1) Reclamation will only make final determinations regarding the compatibility of existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses with public needs or project purposes through a public process involving one or more public meetings. Examples of such public processes include resource management plan development, recreation demand analysis studies, and project feasibility studies.

      (2) Reclamation will notify in writing all potentially affected holders of existing authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential use regarding the opportunities for public participation when any action is proposed that could lead to an incompatibility determination.

      (3) Determinations that existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses are not compatible with public needs will be published in the

      (4) If a determination of incompatibility with public needs is made, affected use authorizations may be extended up to 5 years from the date of publication in the  if the Regional Director determines that such extension is necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.

      (b) Reclamation will conduct a compliance review of all existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses at least once every 5 years to determine if the following criteria are being met:

      (1) Environmental requirements;

      (2) Public health and safety requirements; and

      (3) Current in financial obligations to Reclamation.

      (c) Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with a written report of the results of the compliance review by certified mail, return receipt requested. The report will state whether the existing use meets the required criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section and will list any deficiencies that can be corrected. A minimum of 90 days will be provided to make corrections identified in the report. Failure to correct the deficiencies within the time provided in the report will result in termination of the use authorization.

      (d) In addition to the compliance reviews described above, Reclamation will initiate a review of the existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses for compliance with the required criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section at least 6 months prior to the expiration date of the existing use authorization. Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with a written report of the results of the compliance review results by certified mail, return receipt requested. The report will state whether the existing use meets the required criteria under this section as applicable and will list any deficiencies that must be corrected prior to a renewal of the use authorization. A minimum of 90 days will be provided prior to the expiration of the permit to make corrections identified in the report. In addition, this report will serve as a reminder that it is time to seek renewal of the use authorization and provide information on the process that needs to be followed.

      (e) Reclamation must be notified in advance by certified mail, return receipt requested, of any transfers of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses.

      (f) Any renewal of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies will not exceed 20-year terms. Any such renewals will be subject to the periodic reviews described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and these reviews could potentially result in the termination of the use agreement prior to the end of the term of years.

      (g) Upon non-renewal or termination of a use authorization for an existing private exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies, the grantee will remove any improvements from the site within 90 days from the date of termination or non-renewal of the use authorization. The grantee will return the property as near as possible to its original undisturbed condition. Any property not removed within 90 days may be removed by Reclamation at the expense of the prior grantee.

      (h) Renewal decisions of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses located on Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies will be made by the Regional Director. If the Regional Director determines that deficiencies identified under paragraph (d) of this section cannot be corrected prior to the expiration date of the use authorization, the use authorization may be extended for a period not to exceed 6 months.

      (i) Requests for the renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses that expired and were not renewed prior to the effective date of this part and were not renewed or are subsequently not renewed or terminated under the procedures of this section will be considered requests for uses prohibited under § 429.31 and will not be approved. Conversely, requests for the renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses that were in existence on the effective date of these regulations and that are in compliance with all requirements of the applicable use authorization at the time a request is made will not be considered requests for uses prohibited under § 429.31. Requests for renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses must be made by submitting Form 7-2540 as stated under § 429.10(b) and in compliance with subpart D of this part.

      (j) Unauthorized existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses will be administered under §§ 429.31 and 429.33 and part 423 of this chapter.

#### § § 429.33

      (a) Reclamation may seek to collect the following:

      (1) All administrative costs incurred by Reclamation in resolving the unauthorized use;

      (2) All costs of removing structures, materials, improvements, or any other real or personal property;

      (3) All costs of rehabilitation of the land, facilities, or waterbodies as required by Reclamation.

      (4) The use fee that would have applied had your use been authorized from the date your unauthorized use began;

Payment must be made within 30 days of receipt of this letter unless Reclamation extends this deadline in writing. Failure to make timely payment may result in administrative or legal action being taken against you.

      (d) Reclamation may determine that issuing a use authorization to you for an existing unauthorized use is not appropriate; and may deny future use applications by you because of this behavior. As noted at § 429.15, use authorizations are always issued at Reclamation's discretion.

      (e) If, however, your unauthorized use is deemed by Reclamation to be an unintentional mistake, consideration may be given to issuing a use authorization provided that you qualify and meet the criteria at § 429.14; and, in addition to the normal costs, you agree to pay the following:

      (1) The use fee that would have been owed from the date your unauthorized use began; and

      (2) Interest accrued on the use fee from the date your unauthorized use began as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

      (f) Under no circumstances will your unauthorized use or payment of monies to the United States in association with an unauthorized use either:

      (1) Create any legal interest or color of title against the United States; or

      (2) Establish any right or preference to continue the unauthorized use.

      (g) Under part 423 of this chapter, unauthorized use of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies is a trespass against the United States. You may be subject to legal action including criminal prosecution as specified under § 423.71.
