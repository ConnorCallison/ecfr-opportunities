#### § § 115-1.108

      (a) EPPMR implements and supplements the FPMR and follows the FPMR in style, arrangement and numbering sequence. Except to assure continuity and understanding FPMR material will not be repeated or paraphrased in the EPPMR.

      (b) Implementing material expands upon related material in the FPMR. Supplementing material deals with subject material not covered in the FPMR.

      § 115-1.109   Numbering in FPMR system.

#### § § 115-1.109

      (a) The numbering system used in EPPMR conforms to that of the FPMR except for the chapter number. The first three digits represent the Chapter number assigned to this Agency in title 41, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In FPMR the chapter number is 101 and in EPPMR the Chapter number is 115.

      (b) Where EPA Chapter 115 implements Chapter 101 the material will be numbered and captioned to correspond to the FPMR part, subpart, section or subsection, e.g., 115-1.106 “Applicability of FPMR” implements 101-1.106 of FPMR.

      (c) Where Chapter 115 supplements the FPMR and deals with subject matter not contained in the FPMR, the EPPMR material is numbered to follow that which is most closely related to similar material in the FPMR, Supplementing material is numbered “50” or higher.

      § 115-1.110   Deviations.

#### § § 115-1.110

      Where deemed necessary that regulations set forth in the FPMR or EPPMR be changed in the interest of program effectiveness, a proposed revision will be submitted in accordance with FPR § 1-1.009, to the Division of Data and Support Systems (DSSD) for review and consideration.
